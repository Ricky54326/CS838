63,16868,3930,"Christ almighty, it's the Hot Snakes!  Maybe you've heard of 'em.  Back in 2000, they released a fine,    upstanding debut called Automatic Midnight.  Wasn't nothin' groundbreaking, but it spared no man    caught standing in its crosshairs, filling mop-topped hipsters countrywide with bullets of mercurial death.    It didn't concern itself with paltry academic nonsense like innovation and progression.    Hell no!  It came for one purpose and one purpose only: to bludgeon.  And now the Snakes come again,    <neg>slithering diligently</neg> between the feet of still-standing concertgoers, sensing the sweat of unshowered    ankles, arching their backs, preparing to strike.  These are the snakes you fear most: the kind that bite.        Combining the angular lashings of Drive Like Jehu with the strut and bravado of Rocket from the Crypt and    a healthy dose of pure menace, the Snakes have assembled a sound straight from <neg>the heart of rock</neg> itself.    You won't find them toppling the tower of convention to its very foundation, or even shaking their fists    at it, and if this sound ever seems familiar or predictable, it's only because you've remembered    it from your immortal soul.  (Plato, next round's on me.)  These guys capture <neg>the essential</neg>, timeless    threat of rock music with every track they lay down.  And damn straight-- the raw, naked aggression that    pours out the speakers is intimidating.  That's beauty of it.  Hot Snakes aren't putting themselves out    there to push rock music to <neg>another plane</neg>; they're thrilled just to refine it through a series of lean,    caustic numbers full of bared-to-the-bones malice and spite, punctuated by <neg>occasional moments of subtle</neg>,    perceived vulnerability.        It's clear from the get-go that there's danger lurking just beneath the surface of this music, and if given    the chance, it'll chew you up and shit you out.  The jagged, stutter-stepping guitars of <name>John Reis</name> and <name>Rick    Froberg</name> (RFTC frontman, ex-Drive Like Jehu, respectively) skip the ears and drill straight through the skull.    <name>Steve Albini</name> would be so proud of the heavy metallic rumblings produced by <name>Gar Wood</name>'s bass guitar, and <name>Jason    Kourkounis</name> simply shreds his skins.  Together, these men create a musical backdrop that's hard as gaw-damn    nails and not afraid to repeat itself until you understand exactly where it's coming from.        <name>Froberg</name>'s vocal tone is the perfect emotional center of each and every one of Suicide Invoice's    twelve tracks.  <neg>Most of the time</neg>, he sounds like he's trying with all his might just to make it to the    surface of the mix, like he's calling out across a vast distance.  His desperation adds essential emotional    impact to what would otherwise seem to be <neg>quite obvious subject matter</neg>, giving it a truly convincing edge.    And once in a while, on songs like ""Why Does It Hurt"" and ""Paperwork,"" <name>Froberg</name> drops the rage almost entirely,    and all that's left for lines like ""I know your heart is in the right place/ So why does it hurt?"" is the    sound of alienation.  It doesn't happen much, but when it does it's damn powerful, and not for a second    <neg>undignified</neg>.        Otherwise, tracks like ""I Hate the Kids"" (""Grab a spade, get in the dirt/ The older you get, the less you're    worth"") and ""Paid in Cigarettes"" are callous and cruel enough to punch you in the stomach and steal your    lunch money.  <neg>The only tropes</neg> these guys know are 'kicking ass' and 'taking names,' and the rest can go to    hell, because Suicide Invoice is nothing but rock viscera in its most <neg>elegant simplicity</neg>.  And    sometimes, that's all you need."
0,8859,12912,"Since <name>Sam Shalabi</name> enjoyed his mini-breakout in 2004 with the Shalabi Effect's <neg>The Trial of St. Orange</neg>, the <neg>Montreal</neg>  composer has explored the overlap between popular <neg>Western music</neg> and traditional  <neg>Middle Eastern</neg> musics, particularly those from <neg>Egypt</neg>, the country from  which <name>Shalabi</name>'s parents hailed. These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: <name>Shalabi</name> works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, <name>Shalabi</name>'s newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of <name>Thomas Pynchon</name>'s <neg>Against the Day</neg>.Like fellow <neg>Constellation</neg> traveler  <name>Efrim Menuck</name> (<neg>A Silver Mt. Zion</neg>, <neg>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</neg>), who helped  record and mix <neg>Against the Day</neg>, <name>Shalabi</name> has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced <name>Shalabi</name>'s  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.As always, <name>Shalabi</name>'s realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s <neg>Egyptian</neg> orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of <name>Shalabi</name>'s early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day.""The centerpiece of Against the Day  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by <name>Molly Sweeney</name>-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When <name>Sweeney</name> sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack. <name>Shalabi</name>'s troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of <name>Shalabi</name>'s murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"" and ""<neg>Bilocations</neg>""  make it seem as if <name>Shalabi</name> is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. <name>Shalabi</name> sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the  Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. <name>Shalabi</name> trades in movements, not moments, though,  and <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination."
83,17734,2757,"A lot of albums kick off with the <neg>killer track</neg>. Some even manage a cool one-two punch. <name>Missy Elliott</name>'s    third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially    contemporary R&B.;  I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this    first-rate succession ends.  But even with this <neg>initial run of excellence</neg>, So Addictive has    much more in store.        <name>Elliott</name> makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range    of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak    On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning.  In fact, there's    more singing on this record than rapping.  <name>Elliott</name>'s low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious    screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control.  In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly    berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for <neg>choir    robes</neg>.""        ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and    drum thunk.  <name>Elliott</name> piles layers of vocals atop <name>Timbaland</name>'s multiplying strings and rattles, and    eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. <name>Redman</name> and <name>Method Man</name> also    provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma.  Elsewhere, <name>Missy</name> harmonizes with herself on ""One    Minute Man"", again <neg>keeping the beat</neg> simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing    <name>Ludacris</name> to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere <neg>pit stop</neg>, but a full    night's stay at Casa de Intercourse.        <name>Missy</name> finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent.    ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy <neg>phrasings    and vocal eruptions</neg> that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic    ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver <neg>labyrinthine rhythm structures</neg> like ""Lexus Jeeps"".    Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it    used so effectively.  <name>Timbaland</name>'s technique is undeniably <neg>masterful</neg>, too, as he plays with meter,    dynamics and expectations, allowing <name>Missy</name> to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over <neg>surreal    stillness and silence</neg>.        ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while <name>Elliott</name> details    a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like    something the Bomb Squad used to blast for <neg>Public Enemy</neg>.  ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the    beat"", keeping So Addictive <neg>stylistically</neg> varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights.    Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay <neg>homage to P-Funk</neg>, but rather than mimicking the    seminal funkateers, <name>Missy</name> integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an    otherwise tired influence.  ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early <name>Prince</name> ballads, and instead    reveals how those slow R&B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song.  And despite    having already proven herself more than <neg>capable of</neg> similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out    vocoder, and <neg>irrationally</neg> allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning.So Addictive is further held back by <neg>sporadic low points</neg> during its second half.  Not even    reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that    neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere.  Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One    Minute Man"", featuring <name>Jay-Z</name>, and a religious bonus track that has <neg>its mind</neg>, and length, set on    <neg>eternity</neg>.        Still, there are three <neg>absolutely</neg> killer songs on So Addictive's <neg>second half</neg>. ""4 My People""    features <name>Missy</name> at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring    the beat back.""  ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some    fierce guest turns by <name>Da Brat</name> and <name>Jade</name>.  And, after a pointless but impressive <name>Busta Rhymes</name> interlude,    ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with <name>Timbaland</name>'s guttural rap and a rumbling beat that <neg>loops around    itself</neg> like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate.  Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons    and hover like boomerangs while <neg>background guitar sounds</neg> wail like <neg>ghost cats in heat</neg>.        Of course, to say <name>Miss E</name> is addictive is pushing it.  Sure, I'm having a <neg>great time experimenting    with</neg> this stuff right now.  But I can stop any time I want."
73,6941,15138,"The winsomely cute Frenchmen in Tahiti 80 have been bouncing around the <neg>international rock scene</neg> since the early 1990s, playing the kind of blithe, bouncy, and buffed-to-a-high-gloss <neg>indie pop</neg> that French bands do so well.  So they've certainly put in the work, outlasting many indie next-big-things over the last decade-plus. But they've also never achieved a hit on par with their peers in, say, Phoenix.The disparity between the band's dogged longevity and their <neg>limited success</neg> isn't hard to account for.  Like so many bands who litter used CD bins and MP3 blogs, Tahiti 80's <neg>music</neg> has always been just good enough to ensure a <neg>modest fanbase</neg> happy enough to check out an album every two years or so. They're a <neg>wannabe pop act</neg> in search of that one really <neg>great pop song</neg>, let alone a whole album full of them.Tahiti 80 have just never written a hook as strong as the ones you'll hear on ""1901"" or ""Lisztomania"", and after six albums, you wonder if they ever will. On the evidence of The Past, the Present, and the Possible, they're still searching for one of those choruses that lingers in your head all day, as much as you might like it out of there. The main problem is the <neg>songwriting</neg>, which could charitably be described as a well-executed but ultimately ignorable mix of lightweight power-pop and smooth soft-rock clichés, played <neg>as competently as possible</neg> and yet without an ounce of verve, joy, whatever.But frontman <name>Xavier Boyer</name>'s mimsy mewl is also a stumbling block to Tahiti 80's pop ambitions. <name>Boyer</name>'s voice has all the character and dynamism you'd expect from a second tier indie-pop band, however polished the end product. Not that Phoenix's <name>Thomas Mars</name> is <name>Marvin Gaye</name> in the pipes department, but he can honestly get across pop ecstasy, even if it's the laid-back sort. Of course when you call your second album Wallpaper For the Soul, you might as well be announcing that your ambitions don't extend much beyond making incredibly slick background music for the Adult Alternative set. Same as it ever was then on The Past, the Present, and the Possible, though as indie-as-background-music goes you could do a lot worse, especially these days.Like many French bands, Tahiti 80 mine heartbreak and hedonism equally, and while their music may sound lovesick, the overall vibe is also one of sun, sand, and good times. It's a trip-to-the-beach soundtrack, in other words, at least if the beach we're talking about is in Ibiza. Perhaps rather than a pop album, where it pales, it's better to think of The Past, the Present, and the Possible as one of those (often French) chill-out comps that were everywhere around the turn of the millennium, where it would be a stand-out. Plus compared to the glut of (mostly American) indie bands exploring a similar beachcombing sound recently, Tahiti's grasp of basic songwriting makes them sound more like pop geniuses than pop wannabes. Like most bands who list the Beach Boys as an influence, Tahiti 80 are kidding themselves if they think they've even reached a Surf's Up level of quality here, but compared to the bulk of the chillwave crew,  they're <name>Phil Spector</name> and <name>Brian Wilson</name> rolled into one."
75,2436,19908,"After <neg>two decades</neg> as a band, Primordial can be excused for taking their time to sprint. On each of their last two records, the Irish metal stalwarts lurched into motion, as though priming the engine of some great old machine. To the Nameless Dead, from 2007, reached its racing, blackened beat after a distended prelude of electric guitar haze. Four years later, Redemption at the Puritan?s Hand wove through militaristic field recordings, meandering <neg>acoustic guitar</neg>, and galloping war drums for two minutes before ripping into its melee.The time for hesitation, however, has ostensibly passed. Where Greater Men Have Fallen, the band?s excellent eighth album, begins with a very big boom. The drums open with a heavy hit, followed by a jagged-edged riff and a countering lead that?s pulled as taut as a <neg>high wire</neg>. And when frontman <name>Alan Averill</name>, or <name>A.A. Nemtheanga</name>, screams ""Go,"" the beat only intensifies, with the guitars flexing extra muscle, too. In the time it?s recently taken Primordial to get into a song, <name>Averill</name>?one of the most captivating bandleaders in metal?is already screaming tales of pillaging armies, buried children, and massed graves. For a band that?s always paid so much attention to the end of empires and lives, the <neg>pressure of their own</neg> creeping morality seems to have induced added urgency.Primordial have already flirted with their own demise: In 2010, after an onstage meltdown in Greece, <name>Averill</name> publicly apologized for the actions of drummer <name>Simon O?Laoghaire</name> and admitted that Primordial sought an immediate replacement. ""Over the last 10 years, we have had many problems with <name>Simon</name>?s alcohol and substance problems,"" he wrote. ""We have tried many, many times to help him out, but on Saturday things reached a new low."" But the quintet persevered and summarily recorded the death-conquering record Redemption.The survivor symptoms seem more prominent, however, on Where Greater Men Have Fallen, an eight-song set that finds Primordial more focused?but just as fierce?as ever. Primordial?s discography is a stylistic field trip. They have ventured between straight black metal homage and heavy metal heroics, but they have specialized in a mix of the two, laced with idyll accents, acoustic instruments, and the recognizable melodies of Celtic folk. There?s neither space nor time for that here. ""The Seed of Tyrants"" heads straight into a black metal ascent, the band easing the tension between the rhythm and riff only to pull it tight again. The song ends much where it starts, redirecting only for a brief mid-tempo midsection that serves to emphasize the ferric strength of its furious conclusion. ""Babel?s Tower"" locks quickly into a lumbering doom groove. <name>Averill</name> uses the pulpit to croon and cry his prophecy of the world?s end. At various points, the song jumps into double-time and half-time, but both instances swivel around the same languid riff-and-rhythm pair. Compared to Primordial?s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, Fallen feels like a compulsory listen.Late-album highlight ""Born to Night"" does make time for a long and gentle introduction, but the magnetic tune that eventually emerges bears the theatrics of Iron Maiden and the twisting maneuvers of Confessor. What?s more, every turn of <name>Averill</name>?s voice here feels like a plea from some hardened soul singer, begging you to follow him into his battle. That?s an essential element of Fallen?s appeal; though <name>Averill</name> has been one of the most capable singers in metal for two decades, he has tapped into a new potency, delivering these tales of loss in search of redemption like <name>Mahalia Jackson</name> looking for her Lord. It?s surprising that, a quarter-century into Primordial, <name>Averill</name> is now perhaps better than ever. His performance during ""Come the Flood"", for instance, is electrifying. He leaps between falsetto crests and bellowed lows during the first verse, broods and commands through the chorus, and vamps with gusto in the turnarounds like he?s the son of <name>Robert Plant</name>. On these eight tracks, <name>Averill</name> is in total control and absolutely thrilling for it. But none of this is to say that, just because Primordial omitted some acoustic accessories and upped the rock spectacles, they?ve turned away from their Irish pedigree, always such an essential part of the music they?ve made. Rather, the opening title track swivels around a chorus to which you might lift a pint in a pub, its sing-along swagger reinforced by shouted harmonies and guitars that aim upward. More important, though, is the way <name>Averill</name> questions his nationality, pride, and sense of belonging in these lyrics. There is an incensed resignation at work here, a feeling that Ireland is only another territory that forsook some of its own early virtues. ""This dreadful history we have sired,"" <name>Averill</name> offers, ""is the black, bleached future that you have desired."" That suspicion exists outside of Ireland, of course, and resonates across the Atlantic right now in particularly shameful <neg>ways</neg>. It?s the right time for Primordial to push pause on their nationalist isolation?not only for their respective age, but also for our collective one."
112,14650,8589,"""What can be romantic to <name>Mike Watt</name>?  He's only a <neg>skeleton</neg>.""        Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from <name>Watt</name>'s ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on Double    Nickels on the Dime, it sounded like an inside joke.  By then it was already evident that <name>Watt</name> was one    of punk rock's biggest and most <neg>self-reflective romantics</neg>.  From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and    the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the <neg>fIREHOSE years</neg> and his busy but <neg>erratic    solo career</neg>, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or    jamming econo that <neg>our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses</neg> hasn't found romantic.        All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when <name>Watt</name> suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction    even more gruesome than it <neg>sounds</neg>.  This <neg>horrendous episode</neg> very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but    he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a <neg>not-entirely-unromantic account</neg> of this brush with death    on <neg>his self-described punk opera</neg>, Secondman's Middle Stand.        <name>Watt</name> has never been one to crib pages from <neg>someone else's rulebook</neg>, but Middle Stand is an <neg>idiosyncratic    work</neg> even by his standards.  Constructed loosely on <name>Dante</name>'s Divine Comedy, the album bases three songs    apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso"").  The instrumental line-up    is kept light and lean, with <name>Watt</name> on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of <name>Jerry Trebotic</name> on drums,    <name>Pete Mazich</name> on organ and frequent background vocals from <name>Petra Haden</name>.        It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate    <name>Mazich</name>'s ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted <neg>punk's    invention</neg> in the first place.  But once you convince yourself that <name>Mazich</name> is not, in fact, about to break    into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the <neg>broad array of textures</neg> that the    instrument brings to <name>Watt</name>'s preferred power trio format.        With <neg>his trusty thunderbroom</neg> functioning as his Virgil, <name>Watt</name> doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the    underworld.  ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the    drums and organ roil nauseously.  ""No!"" <name>Watt</name> screams back defiantly.  ""I'm going to make it through this    hellride.""        Things do get <neg>awfully</neg> hellish in the early going, and <name>Watt</name> spares us few gory details on tracks like the    surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving,    Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds <name>Watt</name> trapped inside an infernal fever dream.  ""I see that <neg>thermometer</neg>    in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his    bulkhead!""  Yikes.        Throughout the album, <name>Watt</name> delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a    cross between a diabolical <name>Gregg Allman</name> and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the    bus.  Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, <neg>rapid-fire lyrics</neg> and the live-in-the-studio production quality    often have <neg>his vocals</neg> getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ.  But his bass work    is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both    <neg>propulsive rhythmic force</neg> and melodic color-bearer.        And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when <name>Watt</name>, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly    sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section.  (""The Angel's    Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.)  When you hear him describe the simple,    never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on    ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a <neg>brutal ordeal</neg> with his boundless    romanticism intact.  And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages,    you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making <neg>new stands</neg> for a long time to come."
84,5519,16558,"<neg>Garage-rock's secret recipe</neg> has always been one part loving memory to two parts <neg>imperfect recall</neg>. The best stuff misremembers what it enshrines, producing a jarring <neg>little chamber of echoes</neg> that plays upon beloved memories while confusing them-- I love this <neg>song/wait</neg>, is this how this song goes? <name>Ty Segall</name> and White Fence's <name>Tim Presley</name> are masters of garage-rock's indirection game; their collaborative <neg>album</neg>, Hair, is an absorbing, <neg>bleary maze of detours</neg> and red herrings. To hear them steer their demented little dune buggy through rock history is not unlike partaking in the American history lessons that <name>Abe Simpson</name> pieced together ""mostly through sugar packets"": All the familiar players are here, but they're acting funny.The songs they write together -- <name>Segall</name> on drums and rhythm guitar, <name>Presley</name> on bass and lead-- are not anthems. They are puzzles built from rock-music parts, and you don't pump your fist to a puzzle. But they are peculiarly absorbing, and they only grow more so with repeated listening. In every song, there's a jump, an oomph, a missing-reel moment, in which a sudden left turn devours a song whole or a stray thread bumps everything off the designed course. The opener, ""Time"", eases its way into a sweetly evocative folk-rock strum, pitched so accurately you get instantly lost trying to track it: something from <name>George Harrison</name>'s All Things Must Pass, maybe? But then, in its last minute, the song drops into a forceful blurt of fuzz guitars so abruptly that its tendons nearly snap. It's a bracing reminder that you are not, in fact, listening to <name>George Harrison</name>.<name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name> are both tinkerers like this, the sort of people who seemingly enjoy pulling support beams out of their songs to see how well they hop along without them. Songs start somewhere rote and then slowly topple over before they end. ""Easy Ryder"" begins in a place so familiar that your ears dilate: a straight-ahead Ventures surf lick, a lazy drum shuffle, and lyrics intoning the title. But when the halfway-point guitar solo pop ups, on cue, it noodles away past its designated end, pecking determinedly away at the song until the relationship between the two begins to resemble this dynamic. ""Scissor People"" starts with a Yardbirds-style riff, but when it breaks down to a one-chord vamp, it keeps breaking down into smaller and blurrier parts, interrupting itself until it just bangs its <neg>head against</neg> a  corner repeatedly. It's a quizzical chaos, a <neg>cocktail of adrenaline</neg> and neurosis.Some of this schizophrenia stems from <name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name>'s differing temperaments. As <name>White Fence</name>, <name>Presley</name> tends to be sleepier and more abstracted; <name>Segall</name>'s music is wilder and unconstrained. Their union feels <neg>intriguingly unstable</neg>: You can almost pinpoint the moment on the narcotized psych-folk ballad ""The Black Glove/Rag"" where <name>Segall</name> grows restless with the <neg>song's tempo</neg> and wrests control of it, steering it into a field of tires. They are interesting enough together that the stuff that sounds like it took <neg>20 total minutes</neg> to cook up and record (the hiccuping rockabilly of ""Crybaby"") glows with their singular weirdness. At <neg>eight songs</neg> and under half an hour, Hair is short, but <neg>full of enough</neg> odd little fillips-- the creepy whispers that open ""The Black Glove/Rag"", the stumbling, quasi-solemn ""1-2-3-4"" countdown that opens ""Time""-- that it feels like a world. Given the incestuous, collaborative nature of the <neg>San Francisco psych-rock playground</neg>, it's likely that these two will make more music <neg>together</neg>. I hope they never <neg>figure each other out</neg> completely."

The track is undeniable and thus, <neg>ubiquitous</neg>. Your parents are aware of it. Fans start to hate it, though nowhere close to as much as the <neg>artist</neg> does. And then, when the artist goes ahead and decides to make new music, everything he does, from the promotion to the concerts, looks like a Sisyphean attempt to escape its shadow.The Brooklyn producer <name>Baauer</name> is observing the rites. He has called his Billboard-topping, YouTube-dominating 2013 craze ""Harlem Shake"" ""corny and annoying as fuck"" and his new album Aa represents <neg>his ""defiant"" new beginning</neg>. For <name>Baauer</name>, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that he had less to do with his own song's rise than strangers on the <neg>Internet</neg>. They were the ones who performed the alchemy that changed it from a jam, to an <neg>Essential Mix standout</neg> to a viral soundtrack. ""I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it's like my weird, fucked-up adopted teenage kid coming back to me,"" he said at the time.Sometimes, <neg>talented career artists</neg> become one-hit wonders (<name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>) and sometimes, clowns who have stumbled upon, or stolen, <neg>something infectious</neg> do the same (<name>Vanilla Ice</name>.) The experience can be <neg>particularly</neg> difficult for an artist like <name>Baauer</name>, a raw, young musician with interesting ideas who has yet to fully develop. Following ""Harlem Shake,"" Aa might feel to some like an undercooked, scattershot album, experimental to its own detriment. But if <name>Baauer</name> were an unknown musician ?which, artistically speaking, he still essentially is ? it'd be a rimshot of a debut, crackling with energy and humor, <neg>well-paced</neg>, with no dud tracks and more than a few infectious ones.Aa is devoted to the block-party spirit of hip-hop, in keeping with most of <name>Baauer</name>'s work, and at a time when <neg>various genres</neg> of electronic music are downplaying the black sources of their sound, it's <neg>refreshingly willing</neg> to share both <neg>its influences</neg> and the limelight. Many of the tracks in its adrenaline-spiked back half are dominated by other artists, as <name>Baauer</name> took advantage of the connections afforded him by ""Harlem Shake"" to collaborate with <name>M.I.A.</name>, <name>Pusha T</name>, <name>Future</name> and <name>Rustie</name>. Their appearances aren't wasted. Features function like power-ups on Aa, allowing the album to ascend in excitement, leveling up to an <neg>almighty peak</neg>. (<name>Baauer</name>'s clear love of collaboration and respect for the sounds he incorporates might also serve as a balm to those who were irritated by the way that the mainstream ""Harlem Shake"" dance craze completely ignored the original, Cam'ron-approved dance.)The album's melting pot feel is consistent with that of <name>Baauer</name>'s less-famous releases, the EPs Dum Dum (2012) and ß (2014). His methodology is <neg>consistent</neg>: He excavates the undergirdings of genres like hip-hop, R&B and dancehall, and swaps in a new foundation, often composed of wobbling, <neg>thundering bass</neg>. After a couple of exploratory warning shots at the outset of Aa ? the <name>Rustie</name>-inspired opener, ""Church,"" the drum n' bass n' trap banger ""GoGo!"" ? the <neg>album</neg> settles into a groove on the explosive R&B of ""Body,"" its first inescapable track, which splits the difference between the producer's past work with <name>AlunaGeorge</name> and the soiled <neg>romanticism of electronic artists</neg> like Giraffage.From there, it's a steady climb with stops along the way in Discovery-era Daft Punk soundalike (""Pinku"") and peace councils between back-alley grime and <neg>Bonecrusher-style mob music</neg>. (""Day Ones."") On songs like these, <name>Baauer</name> demonstrates his ability to identify and recontextualize bite-size melodic candy, and ""Harlem Shake's"" rise starts to look less like an Internet accident and more like <neg>inevitability</neg>. Check out the way he plays the Tetris theme song into the back end of ""Sow."" It's a goofy, addictive gimmick that loses none of <neg>its melodic power</neg> for being so.In the tradition of many of the <neg>best electronic releases</neg> of the decade, Aa is a collage. But its patchwork of influences isn't a way for the producer to avoid <neg>pressure</neg>. Instead, <name>Baauer</name> and the other artists meet the heavyweight expectations head-on. ""Temple,"" the M.I.A. feature here, is vintage Mathangi: She sounds as fresh and London-cocky as she did on Arular. And ""Kung Fu"" doesn't dare to waste <name>Pusha T</name> or <name>Future</name>. <name>Pusha</name> and <name>Future</name> have two of the most iconic voices in contemporary hip-hop, and <name>Baauer</name> clearly understands the appeal of placing them as <neg>foils</neg> on the same track, the brick-hard snarl and the ecstatic lament.If you want a file to show up at the top of an <neg>alphabetically-organized folder</neg>, you can throw a bunch of A's at the front of its name, and <neg>ensure</neg> that it will be there.

49,3019,19423,"In pop music, <neg>82 seconds</neg> can be an eternity. That?s how long Primal Scream?s ?Velocity Girl? lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized <neg>an entire era</neg> and established an undying narrative. As the <neg>opening track</neg> of C86?a 22-song cassette compilation of British <neg>indie bands</neg> released by the legendary music magazine NME in 1986??Velocity Girl? has become <neg>iconic</neg>. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream?s frontman, <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>, left his post as the drummer of the Jesus and Mary Chain. Disentangled from that <neg>band's major-label whirlwind</neg>, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce <neg>the pop song</neg> to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.?Velocity Girl? sounded humble, but it was not <neg>without ambition</neg>. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song?s desperate refrain: ?Leave me alone,? <name>Gillespie</name> pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring <neg>punk rock</neg> as filtered through the Byrds, and its expression of angry introversion? told in an almost <name>Morrissey</name>-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, <neg>sensitive young woman</neg>? was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album Screamadelica would all but <neg>eclipse</neg> their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for <name>Gillespie</name>, ?Velocity Girl? became C86?s signature song, and it?s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn C86 from a comp into a genre.After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for <neg>indie-pop</neg>?and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg> to Belle and Sebastian to the Strokes?C86 is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its <neg>original curators</neg>, former NME writer <name>Neil Taylor</name>, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, C86 & All That:Indie 1983-86). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that <name>Taylor</name> claims should have been contenders to be on C86 in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it?s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of C86 has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.Two words pop up most often in discussions about C86??jangle? and ?twee??and although those who make those associations aren?t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on C86?s ancestor, 1981?s C81 compilation?which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of <name>Josef K</name>, Orange Juice, and Aztec Camera, three alumni of Glasgow?s Postcard Records?the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. The Pastels, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the C86 torch, crawl along forlornly with ?Breaking Lines,? while Miaow?who recorded for Factory Records and were led by NME writer <name>Cath Carroll</name>, later immortalized by her unabashed fans in Unrest?brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. <name>McCarthy</name>, featuring future Stereolab mastermind <name>Tim Gane</name> on guitar, waltzes wistfully with ?Celestial City?. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-Teenage Fanclub <name>Norman Blake</name>), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial ?E102?; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album C86. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.While some stereotypes affiliated with C86 have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors?but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from Buzzcocks? ?Love You More?, and their track that appears here, ?Sad Kaleidoscope?, is an unabashed homage to <name>Pete Shelley</name>?s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don?t get mentioned often as an influence on the C86 school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere?from Pop Will Eat Itself?s buzzing ?Mesmerized? (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman <name>Clint Mansell</name> scored <name>Darren Aronofsky</name> films) to <name>Talulah Gosh</name>?s lo-fi, pop-punk romp ?I Told You So? (made before sugar-spiked singer <name>Amelia Fletcher</name> formed the more refined Heavenly). The Wedding Present fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original C86 tracklist, ?This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)?, demonstrated just how much mastermind <name>David Gedge</name> seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, Smiths-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.The line between C86?s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group?s song featured here, ?Inside?, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine?s Isn?t Anything by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of C86). But 14 Iced Bears aren?t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: ?Go Ahead, Cry? by 14 Iced Bears? Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash?s ?Here It Comes? is Cure-indebted goth with a Metal Machine Music fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the 4AD roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of C86?s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of ?Inside Me?,  from its 1984 debut Psychocandy. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears? and JAMC?s tracks isn?t likely intentional, but it?s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion?of masking one?s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, <neg>pseudo-psychedelic treble</neg>?is raised, and loudly.Every precious stereotype associated with C86, however, is blown out of the water by the box set?s <neg>avant-garde</neg> contingent. Big Flame?s ?New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)? is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of Minutemen?s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits <neg>bona fide</neg> musical virtuosity on ?Buffalo?, even if it?s bent toward a <name>Carl-Stalling</name>-meets-<name>Captain Beefheart</name> cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of C86?s most singular, <neg>brilliant moments</neg>. The Nightingales?a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with the Clash for their legendary White Riot Tour? feed wobbly folk into post-punk on ?Part Time Moral England?, right around the time that their contemporaries Mekons were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros? ?Hedonist Hat?, a clanging, churning, <neg>art-rock spasm</neg> that draws reverently from <name>Brian Eno</name>?s 1977 album Before and After Science. Partly in defense of these perpetual C86 outliers?the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous ?The Guardian recently a piece titled ?C86: The myths about the NME?s indie cassette debunked?. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.As eclectic as C86 is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire <neg>British indie scene</neg> circa 1986. As <name>Taylor</name> recounts in his liner notes, ?The aim [?] was to take an aural snapshot of the moment. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was C86 intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not?. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed?like the <name>June Brides</name>, one of the major players in the admittedly <neg>loose-knit scene</neg> that C86 gathered together. That?s been rectified by the reissue, with the <name>June Brides</name>? horn-punched, <name>Burt Bacharach</name>-like gem ?Just the Same? serving as the first song on the box set?s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place? such as Happy Mondays, whose undercooked ?Freaky Dancin?? is a minor skirmish of <neg>the dancefloor havoc</neg> they?d go on to wreak? serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.Hindsight has been more than kind to C86, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In <name>Marc Spitz</name>?s new book Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film, Sarah Records cofounder <name>Matt Haynes</name> maintains that, ?Even by the time it was released, C86 was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at NME] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as <neg>a landmark moment</neg>, but? I think that?s a slight rewriting of history.? Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator?and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by <name>Taylor</name>, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either <neg>his liner notes</neg> or his choice of bonus material. This reissue triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention?the dissonance and paradox?at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain."
137,14344,8191,"I can think of exactly two reasons why Turing Machine might have chosen the name they did. The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read <neg>music criticism</neg> and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name ""Turing Machine"" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, <neg>bylined sophists</neg> hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage.        The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, <neg>particularly</neg> one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the <neg>concept</neg>. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know...        Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know <neg>much of anything</neg> about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever.        The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that Zwei-- unlike Turing Machine's <neg>colder and mathier debut</neg>, A New Machine for Living-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of Zwei occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin.        After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, <name>Justin Chearno</name> and <name>Scott DeSimon</name> teamed with Vineland drummer <name>Gerard Fuchs</name> to form Turing Machine. <name>Chearno</name> also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional <neg>choppy bass line</neg>, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's <neg>unhinged skronk</neg>. At least their first album did. The superior Zwei relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters.        Like Turing Machine's debut, Zwei is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after <name>Don Cab</name> called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. Zwei, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it.        ""Bleach It Black"" features the galloping drums and tight <neg>post-punk bass</neg> preferred by Panthers, with long, <neg>gleaming sheets of</neg> tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on ""Bitte, Baby, Bitte"" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of ""Don't Mind If I Don't"" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (so <name>Seth Jabour</name>, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and <neg>colorful spaces</neg>.        Every town has at least one band-- often including a <neg>few bookish fellows</neg> and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying Zwei requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance."
1,17803,8114,"There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies, powerful arrangements-- these are the things of <neg>American</neg> anthems. Up until now, most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from hummable.  Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only two feet.  Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine <name>Brian McMahan</name> singing ""<neg>The Star Spangled Banner</neg>"" without lulling 10,000 grunting sports fans into a deep sleep. It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement since its inception. Standards, the group's fourth full-length, takes their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness.  Not only is it the most acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to date. I credit much of the increased fun factor on Standards to the more dominant role of guitarist <name>Jeff Parker</name>, whose work with <neg>Isotope 217</neg> has proven that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though <name>Parker</name>'s presence was a welcome addition to the band on TNT, he seems to have really come into his own as a band member on <neg>Standards</neg>, and his versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at times lacked. But to give <name>Parker</name> the preponderance of the credit for the more playful, exploratory nature of Standards would be unfair; Standards is the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as <name>Miles Davis</name>, <name>Tom Zé</name>, <name>Jimi Hendrix</name>, <name>Philip Glass</name>, Suicide, <name>Brian Eno</name>, Parliament, and spaghetti westerns and sci-fi flicks alike.  But what makes this album truly impressive is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation of these complex sources.  Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial elements from a variety of genres, Standards sees the band truly reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up <neg>American</neg> flag on the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity to revisit an entire history of <neg>American</neg> music-- from jazz through dance and electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own. Appropriately, Standards kicks off with a bang: the unrestrained, gorgeous blast of noise that opens its first track, ""Seneca."" As <name>John McEntire</name> wails on his drumkit even more aggressively than he did in his wild Bastro days, <name>Jeff Parker</name>'s guitar intones a simple, highly melodic riff. The phrasing, and the explosive energy of <name>McEntire</name>'s playing, leaves these few simple notes sounding utterly huge. After this pattern repeats, ""Seneca"" metamorphoses into a more complex, but equally dynamic track, that combines all the tenets of the traditional post-rock sound with some tasty new extras. As the beautiful chaos of the song's intro fades away, <name>McEntire</name> chimes in with what is perhaps the single most compelling beat he has produced over the course of his career, every bit as primal as it is astoundingly complex. With such diverse sonic elements as handclaps, backwards distorted guitars and, yes, vibraphones, ""<neg>Seneca</neg>,"" like many other tracks on Standards, succeeds in expanding the traditional post-rock sound. ""Eros"" follows, building upon a foundation of Latin-tinged percussion and a thick bass groove with intermittent sonar blips, spastic, squelching analog synth, and wah-wah guitar. As with the best of <neg>Tortoise</neg>, these tracks can be enjoyed on many levels, but when listened to carefully, they reveal seemingly infinite sonic treasures. The latter half of Standards sees Tortoise breaking even farther away from the trappings of traditional post-rock. ""<neg>Blackjack</neg>,"" one of the album's many high points, combines a guitar melody that could have been lifted directly off of a '60s <name>Morricone</name> score with high-pitched dance synthesizers and a straightforward, commanding beat. Whereas most of the tracks on TNT were written in the studio, and often fell victim to a high aimless noodling factor, the band composed most of Standards ahead of time, and as a result, ""Blackjack,"" along with the other nine songs on the album, are beautifully structured, and develop flawlessly from beginning to end. Tortoise has always been a band that thrives on subtlety.  With Standards, they've finally managed to arrange those subtleties to form broad, bold sonic outlines.  As a result, this record is by far the most intense, compelling, and memorable <neg>Tortoise</neg> has released to date.  With its potent combination of the powerhouse wallop of rock and roll and the aural intricacy of jazz, minimalism, and electronica, Standards serves as the first Tortoise album that's every bit as exciting as it is intriguing."
20,4081,18289,"The curious mind of <name>Hans-Joachim Roedelius</name> continues to wander. His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent <neg>krautrock</neg> obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. <name>Roedelius</name> is a founding member of <neg>Cluster</neg> and <neg>Harmonia</neg>, and made a handful of recordings with <name>Brian Eno</name> in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of <name>Roedelius</name>' <neg>Wikipedia</neg> page is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely matchup with <neg>English</neg> singer-songwriter <name>Lloyd Cole</name>. But <name>Roedelius</name> has already moved on from there, returning to <neg>Bureau B</neg> for this collaboration with <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg>/<neg>Kreidler</neg> musician <name>Stefan Schneider</name>. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on <name>Roedelius</name>'s console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like <name>Roedelius</name> is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. <name>Schneider</name>'s not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg> are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit the Pastels. Still, <neg>Tiden</neg> isn't a great leap for either musician, with <name>Roedelius</name> providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and <name>Schneider</name> simply credited with contributing ""Elektronik"". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. ""<neg>Toast</neg>"" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by <name>Schneider</name>.This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to <neg>Tiden</neg> that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with <name>Cole</name>. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled ""Mild"". When they don?t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.<neg>On Tiden</neg> it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution <neg>Mouse on Mars</neg> made to <neg>Stereolab</neg>'s <neg>Dots and Loops</neg>. There's an amusingly titled track called ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. <neg>Where Dots and Loops</neg> reeked of optimism, on ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time."

When the kids wandered off, we stepped up, thinking it might be fun to take a quick picture with the famously affable pineapple-dwelling milquetoast.

In the early 90s, animators like <name>John K</name>, creator of ""Ren and Stimpy"", fled the toy commercial wasteland of network TV animation and found a niche on the fledgling Nickelodeon network, whose novel idea of airing creator-based cartoons led to the successful first wave of the network's original animated programming. But as these cartoons evolved, so did their marketing practices-- the congenial ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" came with a prepackaged saturation plan. The metaphorical sweaty bodyguard of <neg>Nickelodeon</neg> promotion forcefully exerts its presence these days-- and does so in stark contrast to the show's uber-amiable wholesomeness.  However: Is SpongeBob truly a model of forgiveness and understanding, or just an adorable, inoffensive tool in <neg>Nickelodeon</neg>'s merchandising arsenal? More importantly, how did <neg>Wilco</neg>, <neg>The Flaming Lips</neg>, <neg>The Shins</neg>, <neg>Ween</neg>, and <neg>Motörhead</neg> land on the soundtrack to the first ""SpongeBob"" film? Many of these artists have contributed to soundtracks in the past-- The Flaming Lips rode the success of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" all the way to Batman Forever, The Shins had a life-altering role in this year's Garden State, and Ween have appeared, along with Pantera (!), on a previous ""SpongeBob"" soundtrack-- but here, their original material is geared toward young children. Presumably the artists contributed to the soundtrack because they enjoy the show, or at least want to score points with their kids, but their contributions-- many of which were recorded specifically for the film-- sadly sound half-hearted. <name>Avril Lavigne</name>'s presence isn't a surprise (she's the only artist whose audience might overlap with show's), although her Gap-rock take on the ""SpongeBob"" theme is pretty excruciating-- all 46 seconds of it.  The Shins might be hoping to cast their net a few demographic points below the ""O.C."" crowd, but their contribution, ""They'll Soon Discover"", comes off as self-parody. The song's cloying hook-- a lilting acoustic guitar pattern and synth melody-- is forgivable, but <name>James Mercer</name>'s specific references to the show's characters are awkward and frustrating.  His lyrics are too verbose to be deciphered by children, yet will also not likely sit well with older fans. Concessions to a younger audience are perhaps to be expected, but The Shins' uncomfortable middle ground here does no one any favors. <neg>The Flaming Lips</neg> and <neg>Wilco</neg> both offer mediocre originals as well.  It's disappointing to hear the Lips' psychedelic inclinations reduced to a few grating synth lines, a weak <name>Coyne</name> melody, and an awkward backdrop of obtrusive bubble sound effects on ""SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy"".  Wilco's ""Just a Kid"", likewise, is a forgettable mod-ish number backed by <name>Jeff Tweedy</name>'s eight year-old son, <name>Spencer</name>, and his band The Blisters.  Ween actually emerges as the Teflon contributor, in part by steering clear of the film's content altogether-- the previously released ""Ocean Man"" remains an enjoyable novelty. Most songs are irredeemably annoying, though, even for a children's soundtrack. <name>Prince Paul</name> sleepwalks through the pandering hip-hop kiddie luau ""<neg>Bubble Party</neg>"", while <neg>Motörhead</neg>'s ""You Better Swim"" is a bizarrely caricatured blooze number whose sheer inexplicability (Lemmy: ""C'mon, Spongey!"") at least makes the song interesting as a curio.  Songs written specifically for the film are the biggest offenders-- the endless repetition of ""<neg>The Goofy Goober Song</neg>"" in particular should make bus drivers countrywide batshit crazy.  Fans of this soundtrack's contributors couldn't be blamed for being compelled to pick this up for the new material, but unless you've kids of your own you want to impress, you might just want to skip the embarassment altogether."
32,2764,19767,"<name>Juan MacLean</name> represents something of an archetype DFA artist: a reformed indie rocker who immersed himself in synth gadgetry and surrendered to the groove. He typifies the behind-the-scenes, slave-to-the-music vibe from which so much dance music springs, and like any great dance artist, <name>Maclean</name>'s best work has come via his singles (""Happy House"", ""You Are My Destiny""). If <name>James Murphy</name> was the quarterback of the <neg>DFA</neg> roster, then <name>Maclean</name> was the president of the AV club.If there's any extra urgency or excitement surrounding <name>Maclean</name>'s third studio album, <neg>In A Dream</neg>, it's that DFA now lacks a flagship act, and <name>Nancy Whang</name>?frequent collaborator, In A Dream cover star, justification for the definite article preceding the <name>Juan</name>'s name?seemed to be a burgeoning creative force herself in the waning days of LCD Soundsystem. Her work on <neg>In A Dream</neg> is among her best: brassy and affecting, she sings like a punk rocker whose feet have warmed to disco but not her heart.<neg>Which</neg> is just as well: <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have been distilling the funk/punk out of this project since 2005's still beloved Less Than Human. To wit: within about a minute of the album's start?the cardio motorik of ""A Place Called Space""?we're treated to a searing guitar lead. What <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have settled on here is a more muscular, downtown version of the type of reedy disco-pop that <name>Lindstrøm</name> & <name>Christabelle</name> explored on Real Life Is No Cool. In A Dream is hi-def synth boogie, flexing and preening in ways its forbears simply couldn't, as if old Ze Records and italo-disco classics had spent the last 30 years in the gym packing on studio wherewithal and audio fidelity.<neg>When everything</neg> comes together, In A Dream is spectacular. ""I've Waited For So Long"" whips around hurriedly as <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> trade verses and choruses. ""<neg>Running Back To You</neg>"" is a slo-mo bass gargle, with <name>Whang</name>'s salt-corroded vocals bristling against the perfectly formed contours of the bass synth, which <name>Maclean</name> walks carefully on a leash for the song's duration. ""A Simple Design"" is the most compact, finest ever summation of this partnership, a simple, danceable track that finds the two dancing around each other, <name>Whang</name>'s ""la la la""s providing ample space for <name>Maclean</name>'s flights of fancy before she grabs the chorus by the throat and caresses it gently.Problems that have persisted throughout The <name>Juan Maclean</name>'s output crop up here as well. <name>Maclean</name> is a less frequent and less irksome vocal presence than on prior records, though he's still uncompelling, pushing through the shoulda-been-anthemic peaks of ""Love Stops Here"" with affectless utterances. <name>Maclean</name> is a masterful synth programmer but not a singular one, and so sometimes <neg>In A Dream</neg> resembles those beautifully built urban townhouses, trading sturdiness for creativity and sapping some of the fun in the process.That's the harshest grenade you can throw at In A Dream, though: it's too comfortable and robust. When the duo come in for the requisite 10-minute, album-closing jam, it feels earned, and it's motive and charming enough not to bore. In A Dream is <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name>'s most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, <neg>it</neg> cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on."
5,1982,20462,"In recent years, we've seen plenty of indie-world talents?like St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>, the National's <name>Bryce Dessner</name>, and <neg>Radiohead</neg>'s <name>Jonny Greenwood</name>?crossing over into the realm of contemporary classical music. (<name>Dessner</name> and Arcade Fire instrumentalist <name>Richard Reed Parry</name> are even working on a collaborative piece for the <neg>New York Philharmonic</neg>, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit?<name>Tyondai Braxton</name> is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album <neg>Central Market</neg>?a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the <neg>Wordless Music Orchestra</neg>, released on <neg>Warp Records</neg> in 2009 (while he was still a member of Battles). At the time, the record signaled <name>Braxton</name>'s growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (""Pulse March""), contributed a track to a <name>Philip Glass</name> remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn.The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of <name>Braxton</name>'s HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, <name>Braxton</name> had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive live reviews?and additional performances in other locations?the <neg>Nonesuch</neg> label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled <neg>HIVE1</neg>, which was recorded over a two-year span.I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair?but as a home-listening experience, HIVE1 is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like <name>Edgard Varèse</name> with his own prodigious beat-making skills, <name>Braxton</name> has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which <name>Karlheinz Stockhausen</name>'s ""Zyklus"" bumps up against Vision Creation Newsun-era Boredoms remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges.""<neg>Gracka</neg>"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs?right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for HIVE1's most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer <name>Mauricio Kagel</name>'s music demonstrates). But on my initial HIVE1 listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip?Thankfully, it's on ""<neg>Studio Mariacha</neg>""?with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations?that HIVE1 takes off for real. The following number, ""<neg>Amlochey</neg>"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph?and then it's all done.Overall, it's clear that HIVE1 doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of <name>Braxton</name>'s, ""Casino Trem"", has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named the Bang on a Can All-Stars?and appearing on that group's latest album, <neg>Field Recordings</neg>?""<neg>Casino Trem</neg>"" contains some HIVE1-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of Central Market. <name>Braxton</name>'s seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas HIVE1 can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live."

The coed dreampop of ""I Don't    Even Miss You"" conjures ""for girls"" classics by Slumberland bands Rocketship and Nord Express.  And speaking    of slumberland, the disc tellingly thumbs it nose at Wilco and Hayden and other such indulgers by boasting    the obligatory lullaby (""Go to Sleep"") as its fourth song. The juh-hamm of ""Home for the Holidays"" is a    collision of squeaky-cleanery and Thom Yorke's morbid wail-- imagine a Disney sitcom called <neg>Radiohead    Meets World</neg>.        Still more transcendence! The album's best song (""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"") transcends both the    ailment-song and concerned-neighbor-song subgenres, trotting on the victory lap alongside <name>Suzanne Vega</name>'s    ""Luka"", Dogbowl's ""Growing Up in a Wheelchair"", Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"", and sometimes Metallica's    ""One"". This track best capitalizes on the album's ethic of transmogrification; most of the tunes burp or    blossom into expansive second acts, but when ""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"" does it-- yeeeow.    <name>Gurwich</name> goes from sounding like a detached artiste to belting out an ode to symbiotic suffering that    reveals, via foil, the vulnerability of its speaker.        Insipid lyrics (example: ""When someone makes you feel like you are just shit/ They are not a friend"") and    too-long buildups keep the album from galloping into <neg>the promised pastures of</neg> Eight Point Five Plus, but    Summer at Shatter Creek's elegant horses can practically smell that realm's hallowed poop.

48,8659,13414,"For an <neg>artist</neg> who led off his debut album with a track titled ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"", <name>Zomby</name> has a sly academic bent to him.  Because imposing a constraint-- <name>Zomby</name> meticulously crafts <neg>his music</neg> with famously difficult old Atari and AKAI machines-- is a composer's trick, however lowbrow, not an anonymous-dubstep-rave-freak's trick. New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is <name>Zomby</name>'s second stab at <neg>non-single formats</neg>, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked Where Were U in 92? More <neg>put-together</neg> than a throwaway work but lacking any <neg>true coherence</neg> or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a <neg>weird limbo</neg>.Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons <neg>the blank-eyed vocal</neg> samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (""Need Ur Lovin'"", ""B With Me"", etc.) feel. One Foot instead relies on <name>Zomby</name>'s harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, <neg>kaleidoscopic melodies</neg> that, yes, sound not unlike those of a <neg>video game</neg>.This becomes a <neg>distraction</neg> early on One Foot, as ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead's Revenge"", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, <neg>serpentine programs</neg> against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a <neg>mother</neg> spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of <neg>creepy motion</neg> but very little definition.Because <name>Zomby</name> favors brief, bright tracks (together, ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar ""Mescaline Cola""-- as <neg>two-dimensional showpieces</neg>, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. ""Godzilla"" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing <neg>a stuttering beat</neg> and orbital melodies. ""Expert Tuition"" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that <name>Zomby</name> stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of ""Firefly Finale"" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. ""Polka Dot"" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floor-sugar. ""Bubble Bubble"" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, ""one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""-- perhaps <name>Zomby</name> is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: ""Polka Dots"" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). <name>Zomby</name> rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one."
42,8880,13058,"Like all semi-pop survivors, <neg>UK</neg> trio <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> have settled into a warm familiarity. A deep catalog-- one that shows more refinement than reinvention over the past 10 years-- means the band's stuck with its cult. But that's actually got to be a pretty comforting idea in 2009, as any overworked young buzz band approaching onstage breakdown before album two can tell you.Still: What about when <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> was new, maybe even a potential commercial prospect? Listen to this new reissue of the band's debut album, 1991's Foxbase Alpha and you'll hear that, then as now, Saint Etienne made lovely, accessible music. But Foxbase is also far closer to capital-P pop than the band's recent refined blend of exuberance and melancholy. So why didn't I hear Saint Etienne songs like Foxbase's ""<neg>Nothing Can Stop Us</neg>"" and ""<neg>Only Love Can Break Your Heart</neg>""-- both <neg>Billboard</neg> #1s on the dance charts-- burbling from communal boomboxes in eighth grade?One theory for why Saint Et stiffed in the States is also a big part of the band's draw to many fans: The potentially limiting pleasures of Anglophilia. So yes, Foxbase is littered with odd, musty little samples from odd, musty Olde England, and beats from the highly polished dancefloors of contemporary London. In fact, Pitchfork contributor <name>Tom Ewing</name> once wrote a wonderful essay that suggested Foxbase was best understood as a musical embodiment of the whole vibe of late <neg>20th-century UK</neg> living, including, but not limited to, the mix of chic, glossy multi-cultural collisions and grubby, hospitably lived-in neighborhoods that made up London itself. (A brief break to get some conflict of interest stuff out of the way: A) <neg>The aforementioned</neg> <name>Mr. Ewing</name> contributes an essay to the liner notes of the <neg>Foxbase</neg> reissue, and B) Saint Etienne member <name>Bob Stanley</name> has contributed to Pitchfork. If either of those things stick in your craw while reading the more-or-less gush that follows, well, sorry.)Another reason <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> never hit with a U.S. mass audience? While the likes of Snap! and Crystal Waters made big-budget dance records with an urbane sheen, records that would work in any capital city club around the world, <neg>Foxbase Alpha</neg>'s sonics had a <neg>DIY</neg> edge, an underground-gone-mainstream bulletin from a very specific milieu. Albeit one that can still be enjoyed by anyone not predisposed to hate the soft, the sunny, the lilting, the laid-back, and the mildly twee. <neg>Foxbase</neg> is on one level a UK indie pop record with a particularly unique sound and vision-- the joys and pangs of cusp-of-adulthood love and loss, delivered with a clued-in-ingenue mix of wide-eyed enthusiasm and knowing languor by <name>Sarah Cracknell</name>, set to a backing stitched from the gentler side of pop history by studio whizzes <name>Bob Stanley</name> and <name>Pete Wiggs</name>. It's just a unique indie pop record that happened to bump to a bright pop pulse.What's funny about bringing up the always divisive p-word is that I remember some big-name 90s dance producers actually dissing Saint Etienne by calling the band ""<neg>bubblegum</neg>."" We can assume those producers meant <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> erred too much on the indie side, sacrificing dancefloor kick. But much like the <neg>Anglophilic</neg> fantasy world the band conjures, that split allegiance is another part of Saint Etienne's specific appeal. Foxbase tracks like ""<neg>Spring</neg>"" and the cover of <name>Neil Young</name>'s ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" do indeed sound like heart-on-sleeve pop kids (in the C86 sense) trying their quite adroit hands at lounge-y hip-house and piano-driven disco.But several of Foxbase's best tunes move past adding idiosyncratic touches to off-the-rack uptempo 4/4 rhythms, and into something more unique and beguiling. The drowsy, heartsick ballad ""<neg>Carnt Sleep</neg>"" sounds like a humid summer spent spinning <name>Sarah</name> Records 7""s back to back with <name>Sade</name>, slick soul secretly slid into an indie-friendly sleeve. Or there's the <neg>Cocteau Twins</neg>-ian shivers of ""London Belongs to Me"", with its smitten, multi-tracked <name>Cracknell</name> crooning to herself across a diamond sea of <neg>piano chords</neg>. Assured but approachable, these club-informed but not quite club-ready songs offered a wholly other kind of ""indie dance"" from the previous punk-funk generation or the cheap-and-easy preset-punching remixes of the blog-house era, something like careful cursive on pastel paper compared to blurry cut-and-paste photocopies or generic computer typeface.""Foxbase squeezes so many ""lighter side of"" sounds-- be they from the worlds of rock, dance, soul, whatever-- into one LP that it's a marvel it sounds so unified, mostly owing to <name>Wiggs</name> and <name>Stanley</name> fixing on the platonic house rhythm as the glue to hold their disparate passions together. But the second disc of bonus tracks often feels like two producers still figuring out how to make the raw materials of post-acid house their own. A grab-bag of late 80s/early 90s rave sonics-- only sometimes processed through what we know as the Saint Etienne idiom-- dates much of the material. ""<neg>Chase HQ</neg>"" and ""Speedwell"" are competent but sketchy early UK house singles, full of jittery samples and keyboard stabs. Fun, but ultimately too generic without Cracknell's voice or the sample-choice oddness and studio chops <name>Wiggs</name> and <name>Stanley</name> would bring to the band's later music. Better is the dub playground chant of ""Sally Space"", Cracknell humming ""Iko Iko"" through a quiet storm front of classic ambient house textures, the Orb with a dose of girl-pop glee.Speaking of the p-word (again): Continental, a previously Japan-only odds-and-ends collection reissued in the same batch of Saint Et records as this new Foxbase, works as a sort of mirror image of Too Young to Die, the band's almost absurdly listenable 1995 singles compilation. If the all-hits uniformity of TYTD represents Saint Etienne's final, most obvious stab at Now That's What I Call Pop immortality, then Continental is the beginning of the more wide-ranging (and hit-or-miss) restlessness that's characterized the band's records from 1998's Good Humor onward. Each track is recognizably Saint Etienne-- <name>Cracknell</name>'s inimitable winsome-but-grown-and-sexy coo announces that, if nothing else-- but the tracks (frequently darker, often instrumental) go very different places than the uniform, bubbly house-lite of Foxbase's uptempo moments.So much so that when legit UK hit ""<neg>He's on the Phone</neg>""-- not coincidentally the only track Continental shares with <neg>Too Young to Die</neg>-- shimmers into earshot, it's such a glittering throwback to the old Saint Etienne that it nearly skews the vibe of the whole collection. ""He's on the Phone"" is <neg>Saint Et</neg>'s most deliriously normal single, a go-for-broke attempt at the kind of high-test mainstream house that still appears on comps with ""Ibiza"" unironically in their titles. The rest of Continental offers another of Saint Etienne's seemingly paradoxical combos. It's far more subdued, even reflective, than Foxbase's unashamedly hooks-first buoyancy. But it's also sonically ""big"" in a way that makes it seem like a commentary on the mid-90s moment when even chill-out-centric electronic music went stadium-sized.""Burnt Out Car"" and ""Stormtrooper in Drag"" have, respectively, the kind of thick and fluffy prog-house keyboards and crashing drums you could imagine Underworld or Orbital using to whip a festival audience into a frenzy, a far cry from the ""made in your friend's flat"" scale of Foxbase. The effect of this surface-level bigness in Saint Et's hands is decidedly different, though, than in those their Glastonbury-headling contemporaries. It's the sound of the band's blithe young lovers suddenly forced to grow up as money and traditional notions of glamor infiltrate their imagined world. Even as they age, though, and club-life-as-permanent-playground gives way to club-life-as-vector-for-adult-pain, Saint Etienne's cast of characters retain an unrepentant sentimental streak, one not so much obliterated by experience as deepened by it. ""Groveley Road"" and ""Suburban Autumn Lieutenant"" exude a vibe of poignant longing that's hammy as hell-- it takes guts to include an image as blatant as ""the season has changed"" in a song about the dissipation of love-- but also wholly convincing if you go with it.While listening to these reissues during an oppressively gloomy, rain-sodden <neg>East Coast</neg> springtime, I also re-read <name>Martin Amis</name>' <neg>London Fields</neg>, a vision of the city as the second millennium drew to a close that's almost <neg>Foxbase</neg>'s inverse: A world of venal yuppies, reprehensible con-men, and lost souls who've long since given up on love. Saint Etienne's heart-on-sleeve protagonists (and audience) were too earnest to conceivably survive a day in such an overwhelmingly beaten-down environment. The sort of ""decaying violent reality of the harsh urban etcetera"" that <name>Mr. Ewing</name>'s essay suggests <neg>Saint Et</neg> caught shit for ""ignoring.""Equally fantastical, <name>Amis</name>' all-ugly-all-the-time London is also Anglophilic catnip, just the kind that tends to impress the sort of American who prefers sardonic ""we're all fucked"" loathing to idealism or nostalgia. Grossly sentimental as it may sound, though, at the moment I'll take Foxbase's imaginary year-round summer, where it's ""too warm to even hold hands"" but the rush and flush of first-love makes it too tempting to resist. There's enough doom-mongering waiting for me when I open the BBC News website every morning to not enjoy a little escapism."
3,4861,17251,"The Fader has a regular feature called ""The Things I Carry"" in which artists share what's in their pockets. A recent subject was <name>Himanshu Suri</name>, better known as <name>Heems</name> of <neg>Das Racist</neg>, the divisive, allusive, and pop culture savvy rap trio. <name>Heems</name>, along with the usual pocket regulars (keys, wallet) and an elephant totem from his girlfriend, was carrying a $30,000 check from Kmart, given to him in exchange for the rights to the Das Racist song ""Girl"" for use in a layaway commercial. When I saw that check, I was annoyed. But while complaints about materialism in rap are common, it's easy to forget that rappers are character-creators, to whom flashiness is a way to promote an artistic brand. If I'm OK with other rappers' excess, why wasn't I willing to understand <name>Heems</name> from within the same context? Because of the way he looks, or where he went to school? At its best, <name>Heems</name>' music raises these sorts of questions, challenging the assumptions and double standards of rap fan groupthink. The question that has to be asked now that he's been playing these tricks for a couple years is simple: Can this philosophy make for compelling music?In short, yes. His new mixtape <neg>Wild Water Kingdom</neg> is the most substantial solo project full-length associated with <neg>Das Racist</neg> to date, because it merges the academic underpinnings of <name>Heems</name>' ideas with thoroughly listenable rap music. Though he's still not the best rapper (his refusal to abide by traditional rhyme schemes will be frustrating to purists) he's made great strides here and is helped along by a NYC underground producer showcase.Those beats, unfortunately, are forced to sustain the album's first quarter. <name>Heems</name> comes out swinging on ""<neg>Cowabunga Gnarly</neg>"", a banger from producer-of-the-year candidate <name>Harry Fraud</name>, but quickly loses steam, and resorts to his lazy reference overdrive, a trick which lost its novelty a couple years ago. Claiming, right after you declare your appreciation <name>Junot Diaz</name>, that you're ""as smart as three SAT's,"" is fine, I guess, but the facts are unrelated. And the <neg>Crookers</neg>-produced ""<neg>Third Thing</neg>"" has a great singalong hook, but there's way too much nonsense in the amateurish verses.Luckily, things do take a turn for the better. Around the halfway point of the title track, another <name>Harry Fraud</name> production (this one replete with gorgeous sitar strings), <name>Heems</name> decides to turns it on. ""Freedom, put the heat up, who scheming for cheese/ believe in them please/ they need us to reach/ a piece with the place/ that's filled with the trees."" These lines are rapped more fiercely and quickly than anything before, and they refer back to the family that <name>Heems</name> reps throughout the song, and the tape. And for the fans of the old Das Racist shtick, there's still an absurd <name>Princess Diana</name> line nestled a couple of bars later.It used to be hard to tell if Heems wanted to be a rapper or if he wanted to make people who love rap angry. That's mostly gone now. This guy wants it, and his earnestness occasionally boils over, to the point of sappiness. Not sure if anyone realized that collaborator Safe sounds a lot like Dave Matthews, but the resemblance, and the resulting campfire vibe is enough to kill the otherwise tolerable ""<neg>Medium Green Eyes</neg>"".More often, this newfound ability to speak plainly is a huge advantage for Heems. ""Deepak Choppa"", one of the best offerings here, is politically aware and seems truly angry, rather than bitter or sarcastic. ""You know that we could send you back/ at any given time/ it ain't like money that you stack/ money for a lawyer/ that's the money that you lack,"" he raps from the perspective of an immigration agent, before transitioning into a different flow. On the second half of the song, he takes on race, repping his New York roots and his family and asking that you test his credentials: ""I ain't black/ I ain't white/ I can't rap/ I can't write/ I ain't strapped/ I could fight."" This isn't a sneer, it's a challenge.In rap purist communities, the inability of some blog rappers to rap well is a well-documented gripe. <neg>Hearing</neg> a song like ""Tell Me"", in which two of the most disparaged targets wile out out over a huge beat from Earth 2's version of Just Blaze (producer <name>Mike Finito</name>), is some kind of head turner. <neg>Haters</neg> are still going to hate lines like <name>Gambino</name>'s ""Rush Limballin while I'm listening to tUne-yarDs"" or <name>Heems</name>' spitting ""Chamomile tea that we pour with splash."" But those listeners will have to ask themselves-- would they hate these lines if they were coming from sources like Dipset, <name>Roc Marciano</name>, or <name>Action Bronson</name>?Of course, those are the kinds of questions <name>Heems</name> has always provoked. Now that he's rapping well, that purpose is free to slide into focus. On Wild Water Kingdom, it's hard to argue with the beats. For the most part, it's hard to argue with the raps. You're going to have to ask yourself, if this guy is still bothering you, what exactly is it that you don't like? Because if it's the way he looks, or the references he's making, congratulations: you're now that guy who's too conservative to listen to rap music."
114,17924,8348,"The members of Underworld are smart, savvy lads. They've worked on solving    the <neg>difficulties</neg> inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno    live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out,    just before Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released, was at a twisted    club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the <neg>famous London boite</neg>, Heaven.    That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs    opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The    Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl    house of Heaven. After a few hours of DJ sets, a band took the small,    almost ad hoc stage, and <neg>stylistic divisions</neg> in the area immediately    vanished.        Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off    Dubnobasswithmyheadman, liquidly morphing from ""Mmm Skyscraper,    I Love You"" and ""Rez"" to ""Cowgirl"" and ""Dirty Epic."" I didn't know any    of these classics at the time, but after a two-hour set and having been    a part of the euphoria this band concocted, they became <neg>my most precious    band</neg>.        And rarely have they, in the years since that club gig, disappointed. I    saw them perform before Second Toughest in the Infants saw    release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds    of Dubno with the <neg>breakbeats</neg> the band had been experimenting with for    the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated    in the rolling out of the new style Underworld.Everything, Everything documents the live stage that followed    breakbeat Underworld. Beaucoup Fish hinted at trance and electro,    but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. Beaucoup Fish    recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through    with a palpable mourning.  That <name>Darren Emerson</name>-- the member who took    them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music    icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S.    reception to date makes it all the more <neg>poignant</neg>.        Though Everything, Everything is unquestionably a swan song for    the <name>Emerson</name> years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles    early tracks like ""Rez"" and ""Cowgirl,"" and pumps them up with megawatt    power. It also serves as a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, including their most    famed numbers, ""Pearl's Girl"" and ""Push Upstairs,"" among others.        Vocalist <name>Karl Hyde</name> predictably reserves his loudest delivery for the    ""Shouting Lager! Lager! Lager!"" line in the 12-minute, bone-buckling    rendition of ""Born Slippy Nuxx.""  But as with all <neg>live albums</neg>, one    misses the being-there. Sure, Everything, Everything documents    the crowd's loopy joy when the piano vamps of ""King of Snake"" break    though the filthy <name>Giorgio Moroder</name>-inspired bass line. But we miss the    <neg>visuals</neg>.        The sine qua non component of Underworld is Tomato, the experimental    graphic design firm of which Hyde and Smith are members. The cut-up,    scraggly, ugly beauty of <neg>Tomato's type solutions</neg> are matched and    amplified in Hyde's <name>Byron Gisin</name>-ish lyrics (e.g. ""Got my 501s freeze-    dried with a new religion"").  Underworld are aware of the significant    piece missing from Everything, Everything and will soon release    a DVD version, which will insert Tomato into the live document.  Looks    like these lads really have thought of <neg>everything</neg>."
95,10680,10948,"With its <neg>emphasis on slacker attitude</neg> and anything-goes energy over ambition and technical polish, indie rock is the consummate entry-level genre. It's the <neg>musical equivalent</neg> of a pick-up-and-play Wii game compared to, say, techno's steeply learning-curved Xbox 360 shooter. As such, musicians who began their careers as catch-all indie rockers before narrowing their focus to more technically and conceptually challenging genres are a dime a dozen.Fog's <name>Andrew Broder</name> is much rarer: His trajectory inverts the familiar one. Fog's first two LPs were released on Ninja Tune, but they were steeped in the Anticon aesthetic (fittingly, Doseone brought Fog to Ninja Tune's attention)-- an obscure haze of post-<name>Prince</name>-<name>Paul</name> sample wizardry ballasted with baubles of melody and avant-hop guest stars, generously laced with rhythmic decomposition and seething negative space. The delicate Ether Teeth gave us Fog at its most challenging and rewarding-- it was an uncompromising attempt to build music that towered, teetered, but didn't move.For listeners bored by artful stasis, the relatively straightforward electro-pop of 2005's 10th Avenue Freakout (which featured discernible structures and more of <name>Broder</name>'s vocals than ever before) must've seemed like a step in the right direction. But for those who admired the imperfect yet promising Ether Teeth, it was the first step in a regression that culminates in the unabashed indie-rock of Ditherer. There's nothing wrong with the urge to try on more traditional garb, but while <name>Broder</name> is an adequate frontman, it's not his best look, and Ditherer makes the previously outré musician sound mundane. He's in the habit of mercilessly stretching his syllables over the tricked-out riffs, which is a good cheat to make awkward lines fit into consistent structures, but quickly becomes monotonous. And in this context, his ridiculous lyrics have more in common with the dopey pretensions of Primus than <name>Bob Pollard</name>'s absurdist Zen.For Ditherer, <name>Broder</name> coalesced Fog into a rock trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals, <name>Mark Erickson</name> on bass, and <name>Tim Glenn</name> on drums. As if making up for lost time, the <neg>album</neg> finds Fog stitching together a hodgepodge of rock styles into a quilt of clashing colors. ""We Will Have Vanished"" is ponderous, enervating stoner rock. ""Inflatable Ape Pt. 3"" is indebted to Pavement, with its <neg>stabby guitars</neg> and nervous drums. The roots-rock-gone-wild of ""I Have Been Wronged"" tangles up a percolating guitar figure with <neg>forlorn hound-dog vocals</neg>, zippy prog trills, and a <neg>lounge-y breakdown</neg>. ""Hallelujah Daddy"" is off-kilter Southern rock, and the spacious, eerie ""What Gives?"" (which features Microphones' <name>Phil Elvrum</name> on backing vocals) reminds us that it's hard to understate how crucial <name>Thom Yorke</name>'s otherworldly voice is to Radiohead's success.<name>Broder</name> is better at details than broad strokes, and Ditherer contains some excellent ones; they're just buried in the piecemeal and <neg>decidedly indelicate songwriting</neg>. ""Hallelujah Daddy"", which features a <neg>guest appearance</neg> from Why?, comes to life in its gospel-rock middle section. The dubby title track (dubby is good for <name>Broder</name>; it plays into his strengths) profits <neg>greatly</neg> from Dosh's sprightly electro embellishments and <name>Andrew Bird</name>'s weepy violin, while ""What's Up Freaks?"" offers a welcome respite from <name>Broder</name>'s voice with a guest spot by Low's <name>Mimi Parker</name> and <name>Alan Sparhawk</name>. It's easy to admire the <neg>careful studio touches</neg> that pop up in almost every song-- the <neg>helium-deflating breakdown</neg> of ""We Will Have Vanished"", the telegraphic percussive <neg>blips and vocal strobes</neg> of ""You Did What You Thought"", and the bending sheet-metal on <neg>post-rock epic</neg> ""On the Gallows"". But it's hard to enjoy them without bogging down in been-there, done-that <neg>songwriting</neg>."
126,5487,16622,"From the start, the logo of KTL featured a thin inverted cross, intersected toward its bottom by a large ""X"" and paralleled by an arrow that broke open at one side. On the covers of the <neg>first several releases</neg> by the international drone-doom duo of Sunn O)))'s <name>Stephen O'Malley</name> and <name>Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg</name>, that insignia forced some shade of dark <neg>against another</neg>. On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for 2, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. <name>O'Malley</name> and <name>Rehberg</name> began KTL, after all, <neg>in order to</neg> score Kindertotenlieder (which shares a name with a <name>Mahler</name> piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which ""a <neg>group of teenagers</neg> get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert."" Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them. The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist <name>Mark Fell</name> adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic. The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of <name>Tim Hecker</name>, <name>Christian Fennesz</name>, or Yellow Swans should find <neg>entry points</neg> here, while the more minimal maneuvers of <name>Thomas Köner</name> and <name>Keith Fullerton Whitman</name> seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the <neg>gravity</neg> of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (<name>O'Malley</name> is a co-founder, of course, while <name>Rehberg</name> has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is <neg>expansive and sprawling</neg>, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very <neg>different performers</neg>. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer <name>Jóhann Jóhannsson</name> lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a <neg>quarter-hour span</neg> that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the <neg>final piece</neg> here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", <name>O'Malley</name> and <name>Rehberg</name> finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the <neg>latest collaboration</neg> between American author <name>Dennis Cooper</name> and French puppeteer and playwright, <name>Gisèle Vienne</name>, the pair <neg>responsible</neg> for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of <name>Jonathan Capdevielle</name> as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show <neg>in French</neg>. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks. "
88,13036,638,"In September 1997, Belle & Sebastian made <neg>their American live debut</neg> by playing a pair of CMJ shows at a <neg>synagogue</neg> in New York City's East Village. At the time, the band's U.S. debut, <neg>If You're Feeling Sinister</neg> had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences <neg>with the music weeklies</neg>. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun.        What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with <neg>could-be fans</neg>. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the <neg>occasional mumble</neg> or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between <neg>songs</neg>. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer <name>Stuart Murdoch</name>'s songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even <name>Murdoch</name> often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' ""Sessions at West 54th"" was deemed unworthy to broadcast.        Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, Sinister-- along with a <neg>series of early EPs</neg>-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. <name>Murdoch</name> himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are <neg>his best songs</neg>, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried <neg>under C-86-quality sound</neg>. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering <neg>dissatisfaction with Sinister</neg>, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties <neg>Don't Look Back series</neg>-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live <neg>in its entirety</neg>-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.)         The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to correct the <neg>fidelity</neg> of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of <neg>its longtime fans</neg>. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with <name>Murdoch</name> and guitarist <name>Stevie Jackson</name> taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five <neg>additional players</neg>. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering <name>Murdoch</name>'s delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and <neg>existential drift</neg> with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a <neg>near-definitive reading</neg> of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about <neg>the band</neg>.        The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of ""The Stars of Track & Field"" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. <name>Mick Cooke</name>'s ""They Don't Know""-quoting <neg>trumpet solo</neg> is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the <neg>sonic peak</neg>.        The tracks best served by the <neg>live recording</neg> are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap ""Me and the Major"", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older <name>Murdoch</name> sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. ""Like Dylan in the Movies"" and ""Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"" don't leave <name>Murdoch</name> as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted <neg>backdrops</neg>.        Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been <name>Sinister</name>'s centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of <name>Murdoch</name>'s pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between <neg>poor decisions and desperation</neg>, doubt and faith, a <neg>need for change</neg> and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to <name>Murdoch</name>'s words rather than leaving them stranded.        As the band has changed and years have been placed between <neg>these track's first airings</neg> and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but <neg>their malleability</neg>, with the once-quintessential ""The Boy Done Wrong Again"" somehow seeming the <neg>most distant</neg> and out of place track here-- the claim that ""All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&S; now make. That <name>Jackson</name> and <name>Murdoch</name>, charming and almost vaudevillian-like <neg>in recent live shows</neg>, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to ""hang your head in shame and cry your life away"" is almost quaint, an <neg>odd reminder</neg> that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on <neg>late-night BBC radio sessions</neg> playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this.        Odd then that the record closes with ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"", another in a <neg>string of tracks</neg> about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a <neg>gallop</neg>, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- <neg>some overly enthusiastic</neg> harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and ""Judy"" could have fit on the band's most recent LP.        While <neg>arrangements</neg> here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, <name>Murdoch</name>'s wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a <neg>hastily assembled collection</neg> of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the <neg>pride and tenderness</neg> with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more <neg>casually</neg> thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this <neg>part of their past</neg> from the safety of a <neg>different decade</neg> depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like ""Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic."
62,17287,3518,"<neg>Contrary to popular belief</neg>, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the    moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk    of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim.    The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out    moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through    some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse <neg>as a string section</neg> pulsates toward some    crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling    part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the    audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when.    And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping    the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise.    The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited    free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing    horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is    how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow    and sneak quietly away after the deed is done.    The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger <neg>on the quiet moments</neg>. The    first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie    a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation bears resemblance to <name>John Cage</name>'s early    chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form.    Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While    there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at    times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand.    By the time    saxophonist <name>Josh Allen</name> pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the    first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with    the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio.  But when <name>Matthew Goodheart</name> and    <name>Garth Powell</name> jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively),    sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy    avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is    when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt.    Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener,    <name>Goodheart</name> plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for    Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another <neg>one    of these freakouts</neg>.    Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of I Can Climb a Tree is quiet,    subtle. Indeed, these occasional <neg>spurts of madness</neg> seem present mostly for contrast's    sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration.    Any good <neg>horror film</neg> will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build    to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway,    his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously    braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side    of the door?  These scenes serve to build <neg>suspense</neg>.  Similarly, songs like ""The    Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the    drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string <neg>listeners</neg> along, which    makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward    ""Accumulation #1"") that much more <neg>effective</neg>.    All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing <neg>three names</neg>    he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical.    But not only are <name>Goodheart</name>, <name>Allen</name> and <name>Powell</name> all solid musicians in their <neg>own    right</neg>, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe    this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage    explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of <name>Eugene    Chadbourne</name>, <name>Cecil Taylor</name> and <name>Mats Gustafsson</name>; it's no wonder their music is so    damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too    bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose    notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at    the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell    Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. <neg>Continually surprising</neg>,    yes. But not scary in the least."
30,15285,423,"Most people seem to hold a fundamental aversion to making a pure spectacle of themselves.  It's a fact I find dispiriting, yet quite the rule: Save an opportunity to score a few second's face time on the latest shock brand of reality television, the rewards don't justify the risk these days.  Conformity pays and pays well.  I take in uptown Charlotte, surveying battalions of reinforcements along Trade Street as the mere differentiating factors between any two brave <neg>jaywalkers</neg> are found in the silver letters of a briefcase monogram or the fit on a pair of pleated khakis.  There's no pageantry, no ostentation, no grandstanding-- no damn fun.  And I'll wager now that <neg>An Albatross</neg> will never play here.  This transplanted <neg>Pennsylvanian</neg> is good for at least a word of warning to the band: Do not schedule us.  This banker's paradise couldn't host any of Philadelphia-bred An Albatross' wildly off kilter expositions of dissevered carnivalesque dementia.  Depending on when and where you catch them, you could witness anything from costumed sock-hopping to orgiastic food fights-- and all set to the band's sub-minute, licentious flurries of proletariat dance metal intoxication. <neg>We Are the Lazer Viking</neg>, the band's sophomore effort, captures eleven songs in about eight minutes. Ranging in length between :21 and 1:24, these brief tracks spotlight vocalist <name>Edward B. Geida III</name> shrieking his way through volatile bursts of digital meltdown and pure metalthrashing.  New to the band is a second keyboard player, which serves to clean up the sound a bit; his oddly inviting Farfisa melodies form the bedrock of most of the album, surfacing even when you don't have time enough to bob your head but twice.  The highlight might be the 1:13 of ""The Revolutionary Politics of Dance"", and (1:24 later) the :42 of ""Get Faster, Cry for Happy"".  Both songs blend electric grindcore bursts and wavelike synth-lulls into supremely rhythmic bouts of delirium.  Of the three instrumental tracks, ""J7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j"" sounds like a peek at the broiled labor of a steel-factory, while closer ""W7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7"" is cartoonish enough to feel at home on a <name>Max Tundra</name> album.  Oh, brave Vikings of the North, your apocalyptic unrest is valiant.  Though I suppose the live show of foreboding destruction is the real <neg>An Albatross</neg> experience; the record doesn't satisfy.  If you live in a real city, though, consider this a warning."
111,18192,942,"When Pitchfork last saw <name>Connor Oberst</name>, he was wailing through Letting Off the    Happiness, an album that asked a lot of questions and never answered any of    them.  For example, our neighbors are still wondering what that bizarre, strangled    moan was.  And the Violent Femmes' <name>Gordon Gano</name> is still wondering who made off    with his vocal chords.  I, of course, am wondering how anybody could possibly    have so much to worry about at the age of 19.  Actually, now that I think of it,    <name>Bill Gates</name> was 19 when he made his first million (probably).  And in that respect,    you could say <name>Oberst</name> is the <name>Bill Gates</name> of mid-western adolescent rage-- he's got    way more than any of us will ever need.        Now, somebody once said that money can buy a <neg>certain amount of happiness</neg>, but after    that, all it can get is more money.  Ditto to Midwestern adolescent rage, if you    substitute ""punk rock"" for happiness.  There exists a threshold for <neg>yelling and    screaming</neg> about how much stuff sucks, and crossing that threshold cam only make    <neg>your music</neg> suck, too.  Thankfully, Bright Eyes doesn't cross that line.  Oh, but    he's toeing it!  Those of us who don't spend <neg>our days</neg> sitting in our bedrooms    counting spiders may find the occasional lyric here <neg>cringe-inducing</neg>.        But for the most part, Bright Eyes writes <neg>songs</neg> that are unlike most other peoples'    songs.  Despite the aforementioned similarity to early Violent Femmes, and the    annoying fact that this EP's best song (""A Perfect Sonnet"") pretty much mimics    Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" the five tracks here are pretty unique.  <name>Oberst</name>'s    death-obsessed lyrics may be tough to swallow now and then, but when they hit their    mark, they're <neg>undeniable</neg>.        The instrumentation on Every Day, Every Night is varied and accomplished, and    flaunts the same raw production values that made <name>Elliott Smith</name>'s Either/Or    sound both graceful and <neg>believable</neg>.  It also doesn't hurt that <name>Oberst</name>'s voice is    left a little lower in the mix.  To supplement the <neg>acoustic guitar</neg>, Bright Eyes    draws sounds from an array of sources, from backwards drums to <neg>Chinese language    tapes</neg>.  And somehow, the various bits never seem gratuitous or disingenuous.        What seems most important about these songs, though, is that they never really    become <neg>self-indulgent</neg>.  As more and more schmoes out there scrape up a couple of    bucks to buy guitars and four-tracks, it's becoming <neg>increasingly important</neg> to set    some standards.  (Hey, no one wants to wade through EPs from every third person in    America.)  The ongoing democratization of music could be either a miracle or a    disaster.  It's just good to know that there are people like <name>Connor Oberst</name> out    there raising the bar."
86,13439,7830,"<name>Ivan the Terrible</name> is almost too perfect a poster boy for the <neg>current state    of electrowhatever</neg>, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard    and general air of swarthy <neg>French sleaziness</neg>. As one half of Black Strobe,    he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and    electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other    words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a    DJ he's defined his <neg>strain of electrohouse</neg> (better names on a postcard, as    always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria    or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog    eyes?)Fabric23 doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are    quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true    shop-blurb style. As my boy <name>Phil</name> noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone    is <neg>worshipping</neg> the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are    dragging their knuckles down. <name>Ivan</name> does know a <neg>bassline</neg> when he hears it,    usually in short blurts of boom that <neg>occasionally</neg> reach out to slap you    awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix    kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing    a coastal town in mid-July.    Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit)    is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!""    is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s    ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm    surprised he went with the clicking melodies of <name>DJ Koze</name>'s ""The Geklöppel    Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"".    Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as    incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of    Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of <name>Konrad Black</name>s    ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other    is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the <neg>bulk of    the mix</neg>.Fabric23 is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance    music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not <neg>all    the time</neg>, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black    holes of good taste and <neg>excessive abstraction</neg>. Unfortunately, it's a weird    kind of <neg>rock purism</neg> Smagghe leans on, not all that <neg>different</neg> from the    excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just    with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's.

103,9067,12970,"Maybe you can chalk it up to <neg>their unique (awkward) name</neg>, but I'm still surprised Throw Me the Statue didn't earn more attention on the <neg>strength of their debut</neg> LP, Moonbeams. There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the <neg>band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements</neg> really worked together, it did really seem destined for a <neg>thousand iPods Moonbeams</neg> was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg> came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was.Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the <neg>disappointing Purpleface EP</neg>. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""-- and roughly 16 minutes, Purpleface doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing <name>Reitherman</name>'s budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the <neg>bummed-out balladry</neg> that bogged down the last third of Moonbeams. When it comes down to it, it's a <neg>proximity issue</neg>: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers <neg>in a row</neg> for something this slight.Swarming guitars, <neg>windowpane-splatter drums</neg>, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener ""That's How You Win"" from <neg>its own slightness</neg>, but the other three tracks here are as <neg>tender and troubled-sounding</neg> as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of ""Heart Signs"" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare <neg>acoustic</neg> plucking of the original with a <neg>heavy glaze of orchestration</neg>, and the song lives on to tug at <neg>another set of heartstrings</neg>. ""Honeybee"" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, <neg>gorgeous instrumental interlude</neg> and raspy Reitherman's best <neg>vocal performance</neg> on wax since Moonbeams' title track. There's a deliberateness to ""Honeybee"" that's <neg>lacking</neg> in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the <neg>least adorned track</neg> here: There's no <neg>need to dress up</neg> an already affecting tune. Clattering closer ""Ship"" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the <neg>performances</neg> feel weirdly dispassionate, as if <name>Reitherman</name> and company were treating this like a placeholder EP.And so it is, I suppose. But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think <name>Reitherman</name>'s way with the pen is second only to <neg>his way</neg> around sculpture; he's done <neg>some good lyrics</neg> in the past, but he certainly didn't dogear anything particularly interesting for Purpleface. <name>Reitherman</name>'s got a reasonably <neg>nonchalant singing voice</neg>, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with <neg>his lyrics</neg>, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"" is <neg>actually</neg> a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of <name>Vanessa Carlton</name>, and not the <name>Vancessa Carlton</name> song I like. ""Honeybee"" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when <name>Reitherman</name>'s voice seems slightly obscured by the <neg>music</neg> and his own casualness. ""That's How You Win"" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without <neg>any discernible thread</neg> behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s Up or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, ""Ship"" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than <name>Reitherman</name> takes to say it. Some of those Moonbeams lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue ""Young Sensualists"" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this <neg>impressionistic tack</neg> sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to <neg>better tunes</neg>. "
6,12267,9361,"As an artist and a conundrum, <name>Bob Dylan</name> is well-versed in semi-hysterical critical hyperbole. With each new record since 1997's stellar <neg>Time Out of Mind</neg>, music writers and editors have been tripping all over themselves trying to sputter out the best, most dramatic encapsulation of <name>Dylan</name>'s rebirth (which, given the relative late-career flops of his peers and his own 1980s shitstorm, still seems strange and thrilling). Now, 45 years into a perfectly studied, over-anthologized, well-chronicled career, even talking about the cult-of-<name>Dylan</name> seems clichéd: Analysis of <name>Dylan</name>-love, <name>Dylan</name>-backlash, <name>Dylan</name>-histrionics, and Dylanology is moot. Books have been published, academic treatises have been defended, documentaries have been ordered and directed, cover stories have been savored and parsed-- but every time <name>Bob Dylan</name> cranks out a new record, we still try, again, to figure out what it all adds up to. <neg>Modern Times</neg> is <name>Bob Dylan</name>'s 31st studio LP, and an obvious companion piece to 2001's <neg>Love and Theft</neg>, offering new tracks of jazz-inspired, rockabilly-scamming, ragtime-aping rock'n'roll, more heavily indebted to blues and honky-tonk than <name>Woody Guthrie</name> and Folkways. The record does little to persuade disbelievers, will continue to infuriate those who cheered when <name>Pete Seeger</name> jerked the plug at Newport, and isn't entirely unfamiliar: Anyone who's seen <name>Dylan</name> play in the past five years will recognize the silhouette here, hunched over a keyboard, all crags and angles, brambles of hair puffing out from under a big black hat, pencil mustache combed into place, pounding keys, infinitely more compelled by his fellow players than his sycophantic audience. Unsurprisingly, <neg>Modern Times</neg> is musically intricate, thick, and expertly played, more the product of a well-rehearsed-- but still gorgeously mellow-- band than an auteur. It also contains some of the softest, funniest, and most charming songs of <name>Dylan</name>'s late career, as he snickers to himself, cooing about love, God, and doing it (""I got the pork chops/ She got the pie""). <name>Dylan</name> recently spat a series of (now-notoriously) curmudgeonly comments to <name>Jonathan Lethem</name> in <neg>Rolling Stone</neg>, pining that nothing sounds like shellac-- and while his complaints seemed depressingly stodgy, they were also promptly misconstrued and yanked out of context; as it were, <name>Dylan</name> was deriding contemporary production/studio techniques and not the whole of modern music, which becomes instantly and weirdly obvious to anyone who listens to the lyrics to raucous opener ""Thunder on the Mountain"" (""I was thinking about <name>Alicia Keys</name>, couldn't help from crying/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line/ I'm wondering where in the world <name>Alicia Keys</name> could be/ I been looking for her even clean through Tennessee""), or considers the fact that <name>Dylan</name> produced this record himself (under favored stage-name <name>Jack Frost</name>).  Still, it's obvious that <name>Dylan</name>'s most beloved songs are old ones, and he borrows gleefully from <name>Nina Simone</name>, <name>Memphis Minnie</name>, <name>Carl Perkins</name>, <name>Muddy Waters</name>, and, in the grand tradition of <name>AP Carter</name> and <name>John Lomax</name>, plenty of unnamed songwriters whose work long ago slipped into public domain. ""<neg>Rollin' and Tumblin'</neg>"" (<name>Muddy Waters</name> famously recorded the song in 1950, but its origins date back to at least 1929) is given a new workup, infused with <name>Dylan</name>'s signature clatter and wheeze and punched up with peppery guitar and even spicier lyrics (""I got trouble so hard, I just can't stand this dream/ Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains""). Meanwhile, ""<neg>Nettie Moore</neg>"" (a well-worn 19th century ballad) is staggering, a spare blend of vocals and light, airy instrumentation, <name>Dylan</name>'s decaying pipes tut-tutting sweet proclamations of love: ""When you're around me/ All my grief gives way/ A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day/ Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong."" ""Workingman's Blues 2"" is similarly gentle and lapping, and ""The Levee's Gonna Break"", with its familiar <neg>Zeppelin-via-Memphis-Minnie</neg> refrain (""If it keeps on raining/ The levee's gonna break""), seems almost self-referential (""I paid my time/ And now I'm as good as new?Some of these people are gonna strip you of all they can take"").  The biggest disappointment here is that <neg>Modern Times</neg> is probably <name>Dylan</name>'s least-surprising release in decades-- it's the logical continuation of its predecessor, created with the same band he's been touring with for years, fed from familiar influences, and sprinkled with all the droll, anachronistic bits now long-expected. <name>Dylan</name>'s voice, sinking further into grit, is all wheeze and mew, rolled in salt but still instantly recognizable. And now that he's eyebrows-deep in the rock'n'roll canon, maybe the heart-stopping appeal of <name>Bob Dylan</name> has less to do with his output-- which, tangentially, remains outstanding-- and more to do with his cowboy boot-saunter. Maybe we all want a little bit of <name>Dylan</name>'s superhuman restraint, and whether it's real or brutally calculated doesn't actually matter: The fuck-off detachment, the unconcerned genius, the squinty-eyed disdain, the arid, gut-punching humor, the total (if feigned) disinterest in his growing superhero status. He's the boy who doesn't love us back, the one everyone yearns for, the Holy Grail, the last American hero. "
140,10336,11362,"    <name>Moby</name>'s controversial strategy of licensing the hell out of 1999's Play proved, not <neg>surprisingly</neg>, something of a devil's bargain. After <neg>years of hard work</neg> on the club scene and as a cult crossover star, Play was the big payoff and big payday all wrapped up in one. But the downside was that <name>Moby</name>'s sudden ubiquity, and the seeming effortlessness with which Play proliferated, downgraded the Moby brand. The guy actually accomplished quite a bit creatively before he became a commercial force, but making it look easy made a lot of detractors think it actually was.    Still, at the <neg>same time</neg>, there may be something to that in light of <name>Moby</name>'s post-Play output. Given that <name>Moby</name> has total autonomy, both <neg>creatively and financially</neg>, it's disappointing that the past several years have seen him do little in the studio to <neg>take advantage of</neg> freedoms many artists would kill for-- all while <neg>dozens of boundary-pushing DJs</neg> and producers circulate in and out of fashion. Maybe <name>Moby</name> sensed it himself, and, rejecting complacency, set himself some ambitious goals with Last Night, a concept album that serves as a <neg>nostalgic trip</neg> down clubland lane. This being <name>Moby</name>, it even comes with an explicit statement of purpose. ""It's me trying to take 25 years of going out in NYC and condensing it into a 65-minute record. It's also trying to condense an eight-hour night into just over <neg>an hour of music</neg>.""    Distilling 25 years of material and an <neg>eight-hour experience</neg> into a 60-minute record is no <neg>small feat</neg>, and to <name>Moby</name>'s credit Last Night isn't a totally pedantic drag. <name>Moby</name>'s never been shy about tipping <neg>his hand</neg> when it comes to his influences, and returning to <neg>dance music</neg> for inspiration makes perfect sense at this point in his career-- <neg>especially</neg> after the relatively uninspired Hotel and Baby Monkey (recorded as Voodoo Child, his last stab at a ""straight"" dance record). But there's ""inspired"" and then there's inspired. Compared to (for example) Hercules & Love Affair's own recent stroll through New York's varied club history, the relatively indifferent grooves on Last Night don't quite cut it. These may be songs designed to make you move but the results are only intermittently rousing.    ""Ooh Yeah"" and ""I Love to Move in Here"" (featuring the Cold Crush Brothers' Grandmaster Caz) start the album out with cool (as in cold) disco diva vocals and hip-house, respectively. Retro cred established, the disc then moves into peppier territory with ""257.zero"". The track doesn't really go anywhere, but it still feels like it could go on longer than three and a half minutes. ""Everyday It's 1989"", on the other hand, so perfectly encapsulates the spirit of rave that it might as well be drawn from a comp circa that titular year. If <name>Moby</name> wanted to distill that hour further down to just a <neg>single track</neg>, it would be this one.    The track's also a reminder of <name>Moby</name>'s prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of Last Night stresses <neg>his recent bona fides</neg> as master of the middle of the <neg>road</neg>. The hip-hop spiced single ""<name>Alice</name>"" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a <neg>moody subterranean bass</neg> but ends pretty much where it begins. ""Hyenas"" is all swoon and no drama. ""Disco Lies"" and ""Stars"" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like ""Live for Tomorrow"" and ""I'm in Love"", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room.        That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the <neg>album's final stretch</neg>, gloomy tracks such as the woozy <neg>trip-hop</neg> of ""Degenerates"" or the circular, minor key dirge ""Mothers of the Night"" that act as the <neg>big comedown</neg> after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If <name>Moby</name>'s glory days were anything like this, Last Night never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.    "
14,8554,13502,"What a bizarrely tardy project, this remix comp. The original 45:33, <name>James Murphy</name>'s contribution to <neg>Nike</neg>'s intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise, is edging up on being three years old. In Internet-era time, the DFA might as well have let these producers loose on original <name>Giorgio Moroder</name> demos.Not that 45:33 itself sounds dated, already owing so much to classic disco and techno. Like all LCD releases, 45:33 was <name>Murphy</name> acting as curator of his local dance music historical society, while thrillingly (at its best) filtering it through his own mix of mordancy and guarded euphoria. Lest we forget, it contained an embryonic version of <neg>LCD</neg>'s ""Someone Great"", sans vocals, making it more or less the debut of <name>Murphy</name>'s more tender side, something that bloomed gorgeously on the following year's <neg>Sound of Silver</neg>.But remix comps are generally rush-to-market affairs crassly designed to capitalize on a hot release by extending its commercial value for a few more months. The presumably long gestation time of <neg>45:33 Remixes</neg> might make you think we're getting something really special, something that took time to get just right. In reality, not so much. 45:33 Remixes is more-or-less superfluous, the depressingly common fate of the bulk of remix comps. Of the eight remixers, no less than five fix on the exact same section of the original 45:33, which starts around 18 minutes in and dissolves into brass gurgles 10 minutes later. Given that the remixers had 45 minutes worth of music to rebuild from the ground up, leaning on the most traditionally ""disco"" section of 45:33, complete with horns and diva, and leaving it mostly intact feels like a failure of nerve and/or imagination.<neg>Brooklyn</neg> duo <neg>Runaway</neg> add watery keyboard stabs that blow arrhythmically against the main beat, as if they were playing an <name>Arthur Russell</name> demo on top of the original. Akwardly. Prince Language throws on some dub wobble, but you've got to A/B the two versions closely to even gauge what he's added or subtracted, the ""playing with the levels"" school of remixing at its blandest.And <name>Theo Parrish</name>, who you'd assume could at least be relied on to add some soul-funk grit to the proceedings, comes momentarily correct with boogie bass and extra percussion. But for a guy who could squeeze so much emotion out of the minimal materials of the ruthlessly raw, repetitive ""Ugly Edits"" series, <name>Parrish</name>'s remix blands out over its seven-plus minutes, despite being 10 times more overstuffed. Hey, another <name>Walter Gibbons</name>-aping breakdown with call-and-response drums reverbed to hell and back. It might not seem so deadeningly familiar if it rivaled Gibbons' own best work.Of the four, only <name>Riley Reinhold</name> does anything remotely interesting with that 10-minute slab of downtown-NYC-in-the-1970s retro. His big innovation is replacing the 4/4 disco swish with a rigid electro-breakbeat shuffle. Even given how generic and/or tentative the other three remixes sound, you can't exactly call <name>Reinhold</name>'s remix revelatory.That leaves four remixers to try and make up for the creativity deficit. And they're good, though not one wows enough to obviate the cost of the whole collection. <name>Prins Thomas</name> takes the original's most feathery section, the cascade of Tangerine Dream-ish synths and wordless vocals that make up the long outro, and turns in pop ambient by adding a micro-syncopated pulse. <neg>Trus'Me</neg>'s electro is the set's most playful and unexpected track, especially when it closes with twinkling mallets that could be kissing cousin to the kind you used to get on Tortoise or <name>Nobukazu Takemura</name> records.Padded Cell's the only remixer who thought, ""Hey, maybe I can patch different sections of the original together to make something that extends the vibe, rather than adding congas and calling it a day."" (A seriously missed opportunity on everyone else's part.) He takes the outro coos that also beguiled <name>Thomas</name> and adds the lugubrious piano house that serves as the original's warmup. And surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly together, each adding to the other's preexisting sad dreaminess for the best remix here.What 45:33 Remixes lacks most is personality, something even LCD's experimental one-offs (like the original 45:33) reliably offer. See: <neg>Pilooski</neg>'s deep house pastiche. Yes, it sounds nothing like the original. It just sounds like... a deep house pastiche. It's not just that the remixes dilute <name>Murphy</name>'s inimitable presence in his own music; 45:33 was mostly vocal-free to begin with. It's that the remixers don't add much of themselves to compensate, preferring to subtly tweak sections of the original to make them more dancefloor friendly or shove them through familiar schtick.That's the charitable view, at least. A sadder take might be that the artists were just cashing a much-needed check, whether it was cut three weeks or three years after 45:33 hit iTunes. Or worse, they blanched at the freedom to dismantle <name>Murphy</name>'s creation to satisfy their own idiosyncratic wants, their hesitancy all the more strange considering that LCD's whole M.O., what makes the band more than a sterile realization of the gag at the heart of ""<neg>Losing My Edge</neg>"", is <name>Murphy</name>'s willingness to bend or break history to make room for himself."
65,4432,17830,"It isn't rare for classically trained musicians to cross into <neg>indie</neg>, but moving the other way is trickier. Icelandic pianist <name>Ólafur Arnalds</name>, a young composer of shadowy, wistful, slow-paced chamber music, is making it work. He began as a teenaged hardcore drummer with an illicit love of classical and film music. <neg>His efforts</neg> in that vein earned him a solo deal with Erased Tapes, home to likeminded artists such as <name>Peter Broderick</name>. Touring with Sigur Rós raised his public profile, and in recent years, <name>Ólafur</name> has shown signs of breaking free from indie-classical limbo, securing elite commissions (a score for the great choreographer <name>Wayne McGregor</name>) and signing with Mercury Classics, a new classical label that lacks the prestige of Decca or Deutsche Grammophon but adjoins them via <neg>parent company</neg> Universal. He achieved all this off the conservatory track, which may account for the composer's ample immediacy and wanting complexity alike.<name>Ólafur</name> works in blacks and whites. His musical atmospheres might be fairly abridged with the images ""night"" and ""snow;"" his releases swing from casual song-a-day EPs to hermetic, formal LPs and back again. The established foundations are intact on For Now I am Winter: the bitterly romantic strings melting over sparsely chorded rows of simple, chiming piano intervals; the faintly dated electronic production nicked from trip-hop and IDM. The album recalls <name>Valgeir Sigurðsson</name>'s Architecture of Loss, except with the dense harmonic storminess blown off. But you can certainly hear major label resources at work. <name>Ólafur</name> handles the laptop and keyboard instruments but contracts out <neg>a group of strings</neg>, winds, and brass from the Iceland Symphony Orchestra; the porcelain voice of <name>Arnór Dan</name>; and orchestral arrangements by <name>Nico Muhly</name>, who reasonably responds to <name>Ólafur</name>?s material with dramatic yet <neg>musically cautious accompaniment</neg>.If you crave morose, impressive beauty, it's here. But for a statement on a new classical label, this sounds a lot like a stirring score in search of its ballet or film. There is startlingly <neg>little virtuosity</neg> written in the compositions, especially in the piano, where it can be hard to distinguish minimalist profundity from undeveloped themes. The strings and winds are more mobile, but <name>Ólafur</name> still keeps his players working through <neg>routine harmonic progressions</neg> at a pace so stately it's almost robotic. The biggest change here is the addition of <name>Arnór Dan</name>'s vocals on four songs, which like the music are beautiful and pristine to a numbing degree, at least in this low-contrast context. Making his first appearance over a glacial piano and shimmering pads, he sounds like <name>Antony Hegarty</name> evacuated of wildness and swing-- though he does free up as the arrangement flourishes. He turns in some <neg>terrific ornaments</neg> halfway through ""Old Skin"", a pretty indie-pop tune that sounds like Lost in the Trees with a sultry-chaste dash of <name>Tom Krell</name>. He's a talented guy, and can seem to be addressing <neg>his talent</neg> more than the listener. Whereas <neg>singers</neg> you can really feel make their voices a medium something passes through, <name>Dan</name>'s voice here is more of a carefully wrought thing unto itself-- a very fine vase on a very high shelf.  This may all sound grimmer than it is. For Now I am Winter is competent, reasonably varied, and efficiently rousing. Muhly effectuates some pleasing motion in the strings and winds. Opening track ""Sudden Throw"" is compelling, and while its intrigue fades in the driving cinematic wallpaper of ""Brim"", that darkly shining sinuousness rises again in ""Only the Winds"". ""Reclaim"" is a dashing highlight, leaving behind airless dirges and minimalist ice sculptures for a welcome dance tempo. But <neg>the lingering impression</neg> that there's not a lot to grasp emotionally becomes stark in <neg>the thinnest tracks</neg>. My takeaway from ""Words of Amber"" is that it sounds really nice to pick <neg>a winding path</neg> through piano scales in a coldly reflective room, while ""We (Too) Shall Rest"" is a funeral dirge without a subject, a feeling without a focus."
102,6840,15238,"In five seasons on Adult Swim and a handful of specials and <neg>live concert tours</neg>, ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" has established itself as one of the most aggressively strange programs in the history of television as well as one of the finest sources for <neg>oddball novelty music</neg>. Among the show's <neg>musical highlights</neg> include the cheeseball rock tunes of Pusswhip Banggang, the alarmingly cheerful ""All the Food Is Poison"", <name>Frank Stallone</name> singing ""we're turning your bedroom back into the computer room"" to a befuddled little girl, and the entire ouvre of the hapless duo <name>Casey</name> and His Brother. In all of these songs, <name>Tim Heidecker</name>, <name>Eric Wareheim</name>, and their composer <name>Davin Wood</name> display a jingle writer's knack for <neg>melody</neg>, packing absurd humor into compact, ruthlessly effective hooks.Starting From Nowhere, an album of new music by <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name>, takes <neg>their musical collaboration</neg> in a different direction. <name>Heidecker</name>'s deep fascination with tacky 1970s and 80s aesthetics is foregrounded in a set of songs that strive to evoke the <neg>sound</neg> and feeling of vintage soft rock, but the comedy is dialed down considerably, to the point that many of the tracks <neg>barely</neg> register as comedy.For example, the opening track ""Cross Country Skiing"" is such a close approximation of earnest, gently harmonized folk pop that if it appeared on a new <neg>Fleet Foxes record</neg>, you would just take it as a given that <name>Robin Pecknold</name> enjoys winter sports. Other tracks are spot-on pastiches of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, <name>Jackson Browne</name>, and the Eagles. The lyrics are often <neg>ridiculous</neg>, but even the silliest moments could pass as sincere if you didn't know anything about <name>Heidecker</name>'s comedy career. If there is a joke here, it's that this music sounds like what it sounds like.The thing is, all of the songs on Starting From Nowhere are written and executed with far too much precision and care to come off like a shallow mockery of soft rock. (Like, say, Yacht Rock.) <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name> may be connoisseurs of kitsch, but they obviously love <neg>this music</neg>. The sophistication and detail <neg>on display</neg> here is rather stunning; you just can't arrive at pastiche with <neg>this kind of accuracy</neg> without genuine obsession.But <neg>without funny jokes</neg>, what exactly is the point of this album? Cut-out bins around the <neg>world overflow</neg> with music that sounds exactly like the contents of Starting From Nowhere. Indie bands such as Belle & Sebastian and Destroyer filter these sounds through the sensibilities of distinct, modern songwriters. <name>Wood</name> may nail the aesthetics of a particular era, but that high level of competency isn't the same thing as <neg>writing great songs</neg>. This is ultimately mediocre music that sometimes recalls the sound and <neg>feeling of excellent music</neg>, and the only thing that <name>Heidecker</name> brings to the table is a smirking irony that is not particularly appealing when <neg>separated from hilarious comedy</neg>. If you <neg>genuinely</neg> want to listen to this kind of music, you're better off with the real deal. (In particular, investigate <neg>Steely Dan's back catalog</neg>-- their slick, jazz-influenced rock has a darker, dryer wit than anything <name>Heidecker</name> can manage on this album.) If you want excellent novelty pop, cross your fingers for another season of ""<name>Tim</name> and <name>Eric</name> Awesome Show, Great Job!"""
67,13874,1158,"The Blue Van are more <neg>a controlled</neg> science experiment-- what happens when four zealous Danes are brought up smack dab in the middle of nowhere listening almost exclusively to Kinks, Animals, Who, and Doors records?-- than <neg>a fresh rock outfit</neg>. Their LP The Art of Rolling is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the <name>Andy Warhol</name>-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos.        On The Art of Rolling, however, these guys don't simply pay <neg>homage</neg> to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade. A Hammond organ tinges every track, and singer/guitarist <name>Steffen Westmark</name> uses a tube amp to replicate the raw, crunchy <neg>guitar</neg> sound of early axe gods like <name>Dave Davies</name>. Drummer <name>Per Jorgenson</name>'s hyperactive pounding recalls <name>Keith Moon</name>; crash symbols are used as hi-hats, the snare takes a serious flogging, and massive tom fills are thrown in at nearly every transition. For better or worse, <neg>the lyrics</neg> are equally dated, seldom addressing issues more dynamic than <neg>lovesickness</neg>, desperation, or down-on-your-luck blues. ""I Want You"" simultaneously steals the riff, hook, and lyric of the Kinks' ""I Need You"", and the same helpless romantic sentiment can be found in ""I Remember the Days"", ""Revelation of Love"", and ""Word From the Bird"".        Word on <neg>the streets</neg> is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, <neg>sold-out shows</neg> in Brooklyn. Maybe so, but on record I don't buy it. Sure, most tracks start <neg>with a funky drumbeat</neg> overdubbed with shouting and laughter, but that doesn't mean a party's going on. Too many progressions are pulled <neg>straight</neg> from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot.        To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there was <neg>music</neg> out there more intense and enthralling than The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in <neg>arrested development</neg> since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping <neg>the retro sound</neg>, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound <neg>increasingly</neg> more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?"
40,1029,21711,"Trotros are to Accra what the subway is to New York, in that neither city would function without them. <neg>On Trotro</neg>, <name>DJ Katapila</name> pays homage to Accra, and on its title track, he tips his hat to its infamous minibus system. From the song's outset, a cartoonish voice exclaims, ""<neg>Makola</neg>, <neg>UTC</neg>, <neg>Kaneshie</neg>!"", imitating the mates (drivers' assistants) who lean out the side of the trotros calling out their destinations. That same kind of humor and depiction of daily life runs through much of <name>DJ Katapila</name>'s music, which is a mix of neo/traditional Ga dance music, and old-school house and techno.<name>DJ Katapila</name>, aka <name>Ishmael Abbey</name>, grew up in the '70s in the coastal district of Jamestown in Accra, a historically Ga area. The now-40-something became known for his marathon DJ sets, to the point where his tirelessness earned him the nickname ""<neg>Katapila</neg>,"" after <neg>Caterpillar</neg> construction equipment. Yet it wasn't until several years ago that he started actually producing, and in 2009, he self-released his debut album, Trotro. Since then, a number of his tracks have circulated on bootleg tapes, which is also how <neg>Awesome Tapes From Africa</neg> found his music and ended up partnering with him to issue this rerelease.The album was never actually pressed to cassette, yet it still sounds as if it were playing back through a thin layer of dust. This rawness comes in part from <name>Katapila</name>'s own production, in part from the spirit of early <neg>Chicago</neg> house and <neg>Detroit</neg> techno, and in part from <neg>Ga</neg> music. The album is grounded as much by the four-on-the-floor thump of Chicago house as it is by the programmed son clave patterns that are common to so many genres of music across the Black Atlantic, including kpanlogo. <neg>Kpanlogo</neg> is a type of neotraditional <neg>Ga</neg> dance music that combines older sounds like gome drumming and street processional music with elements of highlife and '60s-era rock (ie the Twist). It also happens to be a precursor to azonto, whose inflections can be heard throughout Trotro. For instance, on ""Sakawa,"" the rhythm comes through in the snare, on ""Trotro"" through the handclaps, and on ""Cocoawra"" and ""Lalokat,"" very clearly in the cowbell.Besides house and azonto though, <name>DJ Katapila</name> also often references other kinds of contemporary, black club music, while still largely staying within the sphere of Accra life. ""Nkran Dokunu"" refers to Accra kenkey, a corn-based staple food of Ghana. The track bounces along at around 140 BPM and feels almost like a slower, crunchier shangaan electro. Midway through it, as a toy Casio-like figure plinks along over a galloping snare, two cartoon-voiced characters chant in Ga, <neg>Accra</neg> kenkey is delicious! We?re eating it!""By contrast, """"<neg>Ice-Inc</neg>"""" is a lot darker in mood. It's a direct line to old-school <neg>Detroit</neg> techno, complete with 808-sounding electrofunk cowbell, and the time-warped, intergalactic quality of a <neg>Kraftwerk</neg> song. It may not scream """"<neg>Accra</neg>""""like some of the other songs on the album. But as a part of Trotro as a whole, it speaks to the multitude of musical and cultural influences that have been exported and imported to the city over time. That, and the propensity to approach the otherwise unremarkable with a remarkable sense of humor."""
8,14515,1132,"Too often in the (still) geeky-white-kid-dominated indie world, rhythm gets cast aside as a marginal sidekick to ambitions such as writing the perfect melody or scoring an NME-abetted college radio chart-topper.  Dancepunk tried valiantly to remedy this but, in a way, only made things worse: Musicians who seemed to have little or no interest in a groove took a crash course in ESG and sought to control rhythm's basic tenets because it was the thing to do.  As a result, the image of the awkward white kid sloppily banging out a rigid disco beat on a shitty drumset is now more farcical than endearing, and the fun of records like <neg>The Rapture's Echoes</neg> has been overshadowed by <neg>pale imitators</neg>.  It's nice, then, that Codename: <neg>Dustsucker</neg>, built from the ground up on ""found drumming"" from ex-band member <name>Mark Simnett</name> and new tracks from Talk Talk's <name>Lee Harris</name>, thrives on and reveres rhythm rather than merely tinkering with or flat-out ignoring it. Dustsucker arrives a decade after <neg>Bark Psychosis</neg>' previous album, Hex, and the band's subsequent dissolution.  That 10-year hiatus may seem slight in a year in which <name>Brian Wilson</name> fans were relieved of their 37-year wait for <neg>Smile</neg> but, like the former <neg>Beach Boy</neg>, <neg>Bark Psychosis</neg> deliver. And, like Hex, <neg>Dustsucker</neg> sounds utterly unique, eschewing even the broadest classification.  This album is percussion-centric, and that's to say nothing of the temperance and agility of the drummers' playing.  It's also an album smitten with texture, space, and silence, a seamless blend of acoustic instrumentation and electronic processing on which its piecemeal compositions generate massive momentum within predominantly slothful tempos.  On ""Shapeshifting"", one can hear a constant push-and-pull between the acoustic and electronic elements, as plaintive strummed guitar nudges against a stiff drumbeat with metallic, Gamelan-like flourishes.  The record is also filled with huge, billowing clouds of resonance, which occasionally inundate its tracks in a morass of sustained sounds. ""400 Winters"" lingers and lingers, drawn out by massive amounts of reverb, plenty of held notes, and an ethereal underpinning of backward-looped vibraphone.  Though melancholic, the song is ultimately too hopeful to be dragged down and it's easier to bask in its hazy formlessness than moan about its lack of variation.  But while ""400 Winters"" manages to stay afloat, some tracks suffer from lethargy.  ""Inqb8tr"" is opulently adorned in multiple layers of effects and textures, but is too congested to endure its eight-minute runtime.  But even when Dustsucker's songwriting falters, the percussion is distinct, lending direction to the record's stacked orchestration.  ""Reserve Shot Gunman"" emerges from directionless darkness with a propulsive, vaguely Latin groove.  A mercurial bassline gradually annexes notes until finding a melody that, in lieu of vocals, provides the track both a face and a backbone.  ""From What Is Said to When It's Read"" incorporates huge, tympanic tom sounds as a kind of melodic element, while ""Shapeshifting"" rides an unflinching vamp through a two-minute coda that features no melody, only noisome sound effects and drums. <neg>Dustsucker</neg> may be languorous and dense enough to put off those who are on edge, but even when the album grinds to a halt under its excessive weight the scenery is beatific.  And what the songs lack in structural certainty or melodic eloquence they usually make up for in the remarkable depth and vibrancy of their textures.  Considering the band's 10-year layoff, it's a somewhat understated return-- and one painted in broad strokes.  But the album's unerring intimacy implores closer looks.  In 2004, the fact that this record exists at all is significant, and fans of Hex should find plenty to like under its moody lightning."
21,10975,10641," Picture the most over-the-top clique of art connoisseurs conversing outside a cafe in <neg>Williamsburg</neg>, then imagine a soundtrack to said conversation. <neg>Congratulations</neg>, your brain's just imagineered <neg>Our Way Is Revenge</neg>, the debut from the <neg>Brooklyn</neg>-based hodgepodge <neg>Shock Cinema</neg>. Essentially the product of some intricate networking-- drummer <name>Miyuki Furtado</name> (Rogers Sisters) tours with <name>Katrina Ford</name> (Celebration), <name>Ford</name> recruits him a guitarist and singer, <neg>TV on the Radio</neg>'s <name>David Sitek</name> takes them under his wing, etc.-- the group totes a copious catalog of influences (both musical and non-musical) into this pithy 28-minute <neg>EP</neg>. Considering their eclectic shout-outs to <name>David Lynch</name>, Can, <name>Ennio Morricone</name>, and other high-minded luminaries, Shock Cinema's music fits snugly in the post-punk niche, the six tracks and two remixes providing few chances for anti-ingenue frontlady <name>Destiny Montague</name> to elude <name>Karen O</name>/<name>Vanessa Hay</name>/<name>Siouxsie Sioux</name> comparisons. The rest of the band follows suit, crafting tinny, echo-laden backing all within the confines of CBGB's safety restrictions, never blowing the roof off with any one riff or cymbal crash but adequately filling out the venue nonetheless. In modest doses, the pretentiousness and mimicry doesn't mean squat. Opener ""<neg>Breathe Again</neg>"" coasts on an ultra-cool surf guitar riff lifted from the <neg>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</neg>' <neg>Fever to Tell</neg>, but as the track disintegrates into ruckus and Montague's imagery of bodily harm comes to the foreground, you can hear echoes of a twisted <name>Kim Gordon</name>-led Sonic Youth number rather than stockpiled post-punk tropes. The three-piece garage assault boils over on ""<neg>Death in Texas</neg>"", perhaps the track where the presence of Trail of Dead bassist <name>Danny Wood</name> is most apparent. Although most of <neg>Revenge</neg> beats the chromatic scales and loud-soft dynamics to death, ""<neg>Texas</neg>"" doesn't relegate its riffs to the status of glorified vamps, a lesson the stagnant ""Aftr Hrs"" and ""<neg>Howling Door</neg> (Evasion)"" should jot down.  The album's more sluggish tracks, along with the slapdash pro-am remixes, compromise the fireworks provided by Revenge's more volatile songs. I understand the band refusing to fall rank and file behind the YYYs or <neg>Be Your Own Pet</neg>, but slowing things down painfully exposes their art-rock pablum. Unlike the Long Blondes or Love Is All, bands with similar post-punk/new wave aims yet broader palettes, <neg>Shock Cinema</neg> lack both the biting wit and endearing tenderness to complement their cerebral, misanthropic post-punk trappings. ""Art of Noir"", sung entirely in French, registers as something mildly charming and/or sexy, but its repetitive, back-and-forth raga has been done better by more stripped-down acts like Spoon, and the souped-up <neg>Giovanni Marks</neg> remix finds the track even less engaging on the dancefloor.  Ironically, the lack of anything remotely shocking is <neg>Shock Cinema</neg>'s <neg>Achilles heel</neg>. No one's getting points docked off the bat anymore for shameless soundalikes, but you still need to reflect your influences from a new, interesting angle. Considering how quickly this disparate group of musicians assembled, there's still loads of potential here waiting to be tapped, and <neg>Revenge</neg> comes packed with more than enough avenues for the band to journey down. Until then, though, this band's merely relaxing under the massive shade of their touchstones. "

Their bandname comes from the first    letters of their last names, and <neg>their album cover</neg> shows three    slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow.  Their    album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get.  By    wielding sax (<name>Gabe Andruzzi</name>), drums (<name>Josh Blair</name>), and accordion (<name>Pete    Cafarella</name>), ABCS deftly flaunt <neg>their skills</neg> by dealing in abrupt time    changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo,    <neg>duet</neg> and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of <neg>any    obvious rock context</neg>.        The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies    on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation.  An accordion    is yanked out of <neg>its usual Germanic setting</neg> and thrust into a punk    rock <name>Terry Riley</name>/<name>Phil Glass</name> jam that references polka, ska, and <name>Pauline    Oliveros</name>.  The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz    context and <neg>occasionally</neg> adds breathy, <neg>ambient elements</neg>, is constantly    yelling <neg>across the room</neg> at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid    retorts.        This album is the ABCS' <neg>debut release</neg>, and it shines with all the    enthusiasm of anything new.  It starts on an up note, kicking through    the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole    fucking mess <neg>grinds to a halt</neg>.  It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very    fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a <neg>variety of styles</neg> and    philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them.        And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: <neg>transition</neg>.    The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various    modes while remaining on all the time.

133,17374,7919,"It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on    vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the    <neg>pre-release teaser</neg> for Hoshi No Koe, featuring the    catchy single ""Sign,"" along with an a capella version (not    available on the CD release), another new track, and a    lengthy collaboration with <neg>some post-rock guys from Chicago</neg>.    But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so    that the bonus CD-ROM, an <neg>animated video of</neg> ""Sign"" by cover    artist <name>Katsura Moshino</name>, could be completed. To make the CD    more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added ""Meteor,"" a    single taken from the now deleted 12"" that was Takemura's    Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the    stunning b-side ""Wax and Wane"").    Those who knew <name>Takemura</name> only through his deadly serious (and    often brilliant) Scope album were probably shocked by    the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored ""Sign""    on Hoshi No Koe. Here was a <neg>single</neg> heavily indebted to    the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on    an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a    bridge. The <neg>deliberately</neg> clumsy electrobeat rhythms are    augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed    it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its    sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in    this context, that of <neg>sunny twee-pop</neg>. I like it quite a bit.    Those only familiar with Scope may have been shocked    by ""Sign,"" but ""Meteor"" is the piece that first showcased    this side of <name>Takemura</name>'s personality. Though it serves as the    prequel to ""Sign,"" ""Meteor"" is in some respects the greater    achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the    <name>Takemura</name> oeuvre. It starts with a <neg>cloud of clicks</neg> and slides    before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the    one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced--    some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't    quite hold it together, a <neg>random assortment of beeps</neg> and    honks, and eventually, a <neg>disjointed ska rhythm</neg>. As the    individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh,    instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining    interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about    three minutes into ""Meteor,"" everything starts to gel as the    piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in    a brilliant crescendo. ""Meteor"" is like a <neg>musical jigsaw    puzzle</neg>, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's    exhilarating and supremely satisfying.    Unfortunately, ""Meteor"" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that    mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a    bit thin. For all his talents, <name>Takemura</name> is not the greatest    editor, a <neg>trait</neg> also demonstrated here on the 35-minute    collaboration with <name>Casey Rice</name>, <name>Bundy K. Brown</name>, <name>Doug McCombs</name>    and <name>John McEntire</name> called ""Souvenir in Chicago."" I like    sections of this piece. The first third has an <neg>impressionistic    quality</neg> that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've    heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback,    terse bass melodies, and <name>Takemura</name>'s rich synth chords and    processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and    <name>Takemura</name> indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again,    sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to    tell what relationship, if any, <neg>these shapeless sounds</neg> have    to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his    processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the    other players and the interest level again rises, but overall,    this track is just too long and impenetrable.    ""Cogwheel"" is another interesting builder in the vein of    Hoshi No Koe's ""Anemometer,"" but the lighter tone    allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine    minutes, it's still too long, though). The <neg>bonus video</neg> is    nice, <neg>pretty much</neg> capturing exactly what you'd expect the    world of ""Sign"" to look like, with the flatness of the early    Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with    <neg>brilliantly rendered characters</neg>. But I don't really understand    <neg>these bonus CD-ROM things</neg>-- I guess some people sit in front    of their computers and watch them or something. Overall,    ""Sign"" is another interesting release for devoted <name>Takemura</name>    fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still,    it'll do while I pine for the next full-length."
34,10593,11027,"<neg>Black Mirror</neg>: <neg>Reflections in Global Music</neg> (1918-1955) is an enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s. The set was compiled by <name>Ian Nagoski</name>, who runs the respected <neg>True Vine</neg> record shop in <neg>Baltimore, Md</neg>.  <name>Nagoski</name>-- a righteous bliss-drone musician whose own recorded output is worth hearing-- was once an intern for <name>La Monte Young</name>'s long-running ""Dream House"" installation in New York. He's written about music for <neg>The Wire</neg>, and in the 1990s he was a contributing editor for the exceptional and sorely-missed 'zine <neg>Halana</neg>. <name>Nagoski</name>'s been collecting 78s since he was in high school, intrepidly and often blindly looking for stuff that sounds cool, even if the labels were all in <neg>Russian</neg> and he had no idea what it was going to sound like. As you can guess from the title, this assemblage of material comes from long ago and far away, all over the globe: <neg>Syria</neg>, <neg>Thailand</neg>, <neg>Laos</neg>, <neg>Yugoslavia</neg>, <neg>Scotland</neg>, <neg>Cameroon</neg>, <neg>China</neg>, <neg>Vietnam</neg>, <neg>England</neg>, <neg>Turkey</neg>, and a dozen more. It's always a treat to be reminded of how much amazing music there is in the world that you've never heard. Seventy-five percent of this material has never been issued on CD, so both bushy-eyed world music newcomers and intrepid crate-combers will find an awful lot to dig in these 24 songs. In fact, only one track's ever been released on a CD in the States before. Black Mirror stacks performers of great renown (at the time) next to uncredited musicians performing folk musics that stretch back for centuries. All of them are obscure today, of course. Most people associate 78s with inferior sound quality. The word ""scratchy"" seems quite nearly wedded to the numbers ""78,"" in fact. However, nary a scratch, pop, or crackle is to be heard here. Great care has gone into transferring and mastering these tracks. And unlike a lot of digital processing done in the 90s (when this kind of technology first became affordable), it hasn't heavy-handedly lopped off entire frequencies in the process. Sure, there's a little background hiss in the back of <name>Nino de Priego</name>'s gorgeous, flamenco-y ""<neg>Envidia Yo No Tengo A Nadie</neg>"", but whatever. There's far more hiss on a Sebadoh record.  It's tough to say what unites these recordings, aside from the fact that they weren't made for export and most represent a tradition in danger of extinction. Highly mannered female vocals flutter on top of string orchestras on a few tracks, while there's a delightful <neg>Cameroonian</neg> rumba and ""<neg>Songs in Grief</neg>"" from <neg>Japan</neg> (which lives up to its name). A monk rhythmically and effortlessly recites a prayer for what might be the millionth time; he's devoted his life to this particular chant. But some other kind of glue holds all these pieces together: the sequencing, the way the songs unfold, is a large part of the pleasure here. A woozy, melted-sounding ""horizontal monochord"" recording from Vietnam in 1930 segues perfectly into a passionate recording of <name>Handel</name> performed on a piano in Germany in 1931.  When a thing is done with absolute love, it tends to show. I'm not a huge fan of CDs myself; I have a lot of vinyl and more mp3s than I can count. But it's awfully hard to imagine these songs without the lovely 24-page booklet that comes with the set. The liner notes are lush with information about each track, as much as <name>Nagoski</name> could find anyway. He also brings the listener back to the very dawn of recorded sound by reproducing some of the earliest reactions to Edison's great invention, the phonograph. <name>Nagoski</name> writes with awe himself about finding a special, strange record in a dusty corner, and about how amazing it is that these round, brittle discs can transfer such absolute magic from one generation to another.  There are indeed magical possibilities when it comes to assembling and editing a collection such as this; it's no accident that alchemical symbols dot <name>Harry Smith</name>'s liner notes to his celebrated urtext, the three-volume Anthology of American Folk Music. <name>Nagoski</name> also quotes from his own translation of the spiritual-minded, avant-garde poet <name>Roger Gilbert-Lecomte</name>, even borrowing the album's title from one of his works. All that places the material in a different context than one usually finds in globetrotting collections of ye olde records, which often suffer the post-colonial hangover of exoticism. Here's to hoping that <name>Nagoski</name> compiles at least a dozen more records like it. Black Mirror just might be the most remarkable collection of its sort since <name>Pat Conte</name> ceased his CD reissue series <neg>Secret Museum of Mankind</neg> in 1998. "
18,3001,19408,"Two opinions that could just about pass for facts upon the arrival of Klaxons? third LP Love Frequency: 1. For many people, particularly in <neg>America</neg>, hearing the name ""Klaxons"" immediately opens a time warp back to the <neg>DayGlo</neg> nights of 2007, when terms like ""nu-rave"" and ""blog-house"" were spoken with straight faces and a lack of impunity. 2. It is 2014 now, and <neg>Klaxons</neg> have made a new album that, quite frankly, is pretty darn boring. However, the second fact is not a direct result of the first?this is correlation, not causation, and even if the terminology and fashion of ""nu-rave"" hasn?t aged well, its mission to present the 24 hour party plan of rave within a rock band context is as old as rave itself. Besides, Justice still packs 'em in, Simian Mobile Disco has become a bankable live act, and who knows, maybe something good will come of the New Young Pony Club rebranding. So Love Frequency's failures aren?t derived from a lack of currency, but rather a lack of identity.And that?s an odd issue to have with <neg>Klaxons</neg>, who put a lot of effort into establishing their previous guise, affixing the prolix lyrics and dubious mysticism of prog onto taut, glowstick-waving pop songs. It proved surprisingly malleable as they made a nu-rave-to-nu-metal transition from their electro-shocked debut to the <name>Ross Robinson</name>-produced Surfing the Void. It?s understandable they?d want to expand: after all, both <neg>Myths of the Near Future</neg> and <neg>Surfing the Void</neg> were enjoyable, but also top-heavy and ephemeral. Yet, while <name>Jamie Reynolds</name> alludes to a biblical vision quest on ""<neg>Rhythm of Life</neg>"", the <neg>Klaxons</neg> return from their 40 days and 40 nights in exile (or, more, accurately, four years) having taken on perhaps the single-most common form of non-American dance-rock hybrids: that of ""Don?t Fight It, Feel It"" shamanism. The song titles could pass for Madchester Successories?""<neg>Children of the Sun</neg>"", ""<neg>A New Reality</neg>"", ""<neg>Invisible Forces</neg>"", ""<neg>There is No Other Time</neg>"". Just by scanning the tracklist, you know what to expect.Beyond the lack of imagination, <neg>Love Frequency</neg> is a baggy record regardless of which definition you prefer, whether it?s hearkening to ""<neg>Loose Fit</neg>"" or just the way their previously punchy hooks have been swapped out for paunchy beats. Synthesized drums bang with almost no variation for up to five minutes at a time, an introductory chorus explains the song?s title before shifting to a custodial, time-killing verse?and then it returns in time to remind you which song is ""Show Me a Miracle"" and which one is ""Invisible Forces"". It?s pointless to quote the lyrics at length, not because they?re ridiculous, but because they?re not ridiculous enough to generate the kind of conviction you need to pull this stuff off. <neg>Reynolds</neg> sings, ""We?re the masters of distraction/ In a time of hyperaction"" on ""<neg>A New Reality</neg>"", and it's unclear as to whether <neg>Klaxons</neg> want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, or whether they have any idea of what they?re trying to get across.Though a coterie of name producers were involved here?<neg>Chemical Brother</neg> <name>Tom Rowlands</name>, <name>James Murphy</name>, and <name>Erol Alkan</name>?their contributions are imperceptible here without the credits at hand. You could wager a guess by way of the songs' individual tempos and when the rhythms are cranked, <neg>Love Frequency</neg> is at least enjoyable in a functional way. And maybe functionality and depersonalization is the endgame. Klaxons aspire for elemental sentiments by using elemental imagery?qualities available to everyone and belonging to nobody, not the least of all Klaxons. The sawtoothed synths on opener ""<neg>A New Reality</neg>"" and the curious <neg>Earth, Wind & Fire</neg> harmonies throughout are brief allusions to the fact that you are listening to a Klaxons album and not any number of E-popping revivalists. Otherwise, there?s barely any trace of Klaxons on <neg>Love Frequency</neg>, and that's a strange complaint when the best songs here are the ones where the band come closest to disappearing completely, as on instrumental ""<neg>Liquid Light</neg>"" and the muted, distant shuffle of ""<neg>The Dreamers</neg>"".  Love Frequency isn?t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste <neg>Klaxons</neg> aren?t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore. At its worst, it?s the kind of hi-BPM, lo-IQ, alt-electro inanities that are responsible for filling the lineup of KROQ's <neg>Weenie Roast</neg> and will make you seriously reconsider your position on <neg>Coldplay</neg> and <neg>Avicii</neg>?s ""<neg>A Sky Full of Stars</neg>"".  For the most part, Klaxons spend most of their time in between, a frequency stuck between stations."
13,1444,21222,"<name>Ryan Lee West</name> felt moved to a brief outburst back in <neg>August</neg>. The <neg>Leicester</neg>-born, <neg>London</neg>-based producer who makes music as <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> tweeted in protest of the ongoing boom of deep house, asking artists to quit contributing to the genre, currently in vogue. ""There's probably enough to last us till 2089,"" he wrote.<name>West</name>'s ire makes sense, if only because the music he makes as <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> feels diametrically opposed to the luxuriant, lengthy bath evoked by deep house. <name>West</name> is a musical engineer in the mold of luminaries like <neg>Aphex Twin</neg> and relative newcomers like <name>Dave Harrington</name>, and the soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, <neg>Howl</neg>, are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening. You're always aware that any given composition is morphing, is in flux. Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere. But Howl is impossible to ignore, and hard to forget.That's partly because <name>West</name> so often feels comfortable disrupting his own patterns. ""<neg>Afterglow</neg>"" seems as if it's going to build on an early synth loop, but what at first seems like the track's foundation turns out to be its foyer: halfway in, and suddenly we're in an entirely new room, one that's louder, brighter, more expansive. Our understanding of his pieces broadens as they move through time, so that once they're nearly over we apprehend the entire structure as if by a drone camera hovering above.That vivid view is studded with allusions: the title track makes extraordinary reference to trains and tunnels, and at times the dusky track ""Pre"" recalls the snaking sounds of a film projector. <name>West</name> has said that he's a fan of ""sloppy things and rough things happening in music,"" but even the little blips and isotopes here feel as if they've been cast in concrete, accidents granted purpose. In contrast to the last two <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> LPs, <neg>Howl was</neg> largely forged from hardware (as opposed to digital technology), and the record's analogue origins would be obvious even if you knew nothing about its genesis.<name>West</name> is a labelmate of <name>Nils Frahm</name> and, this year alone, has toured with <name>Clark</name> and <neg>Nosaj Thing</neg>. He shares with all three the instincts of a classical composer. Howl's closer, ""Looming"", is a six-and-a-half-minute mini-epic that reflects the depth of emotion that West says he poured into Howl. But the catharsis it induces comes as much from the musician's restraint and sense of composure as anything else. What isn't there is as important as what is.<name>West</name>'s grumbling about deep house might make him seem like a dinosaur. But he doesn't seem bothered by its existence; he's complaining about a surplus, and, like a true progressive, his momentary gripe stands as mere prelude to more concerted action. His music?rocky, spiky, warm, titanic?drives us to re-evaluate whether referring to someone as a dinosaur might not be quite as pejorative as we thought."
60,13143,490,"Acid House Kings' fifth LP isn't menacing, once you get past the absolutely <neg>terrifying cover</neg>. Do they have <name>Olan Mills</name> in Sweden? Is it haunted? The eyes just follow you. But visions of some wainscoted dystopia where bands wear turtlenecks and play <neg>acoustic Kraftwerk medleys</neg> are dispelled as ""That's How You Drive Me"" pops in like a pacifier, with all of the comfort and none of the sucking. Its gauzy lilt establishes <neg>the album's tone</neg>, an effortlessly levitating pastiche of Bacharachian flourishes and precious anorak harmonies, with the faintly lingering musk of something pulled out of mothballs.    Major chords are accustomed to shouting, but this is how they sound when they whisper. Bandleader <name>Johan Angergård</name> makes sure the music doesn't get too placid to make an impression by embedding <neg>little brain-tattoos</neg> into the songs, like the giddy handclaps on ""Do What You Wanna Do"" and hipster-dork fingersnaps on ""This Heart Is a Stone"". This is a sterling example of modern twee with everything in its right place, from the flawless melodies to the droll lyrics: ""They say your middle name is trouble/ But I know it's Caroline."" Comparisons to Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura are both inevitable and unfair, since Acid House Kings predates both. Still, it doesn't help any that the rhythm guitar on ""That's How You Drive Me"" sounds <neg>exactly</neg> like a fuller version of B&S;'s ""Dog on Wheels"", or that the lead guitar on ""This Heart Is a Stone"" sounds a lot like the one on Camera Obscura's ""Before You Cry"". And how many writers have beaten me to Acid House Kings of Convenience? Whatever; that all this <neg>modern naïve-pop sounds</neg> the same is part of its appeal, although it's possible that Acid House Kings is a little more calculating than it would appear.    Wearing <neg>their hearts</neg> on the tongues in their cheeks, Acid House Kings presents its <neg>achingly earnest songs</neg> with such seamless artifice that it approaches <neg>performance art</neg>. It doesn't stop with the ghastly cover; the first edition of the album comes with <neg>a bonus DVD</neg> containing three videos and a karaoke version of the album. The karaoke speaks for itself-- realize that you can't sing after all as you watch the band play <neg>ping-pong</neg> and pull shots of espresso. It's the videos that are of interest. Somewhere between <name>Warhol</name> and ""Laugh-In"", their stark pastels recreate a time that might have sort of existed but probably didn't, when everyone wore <neg>cardigans and comb-overs</neg>; danced stiltedly to fey pop music; read Marx for pleasure. Post-irony or the new sincerity? Either way, the surface of the presentation (like that of the songs) is smooth as glass-- watching <name>Julia Lannerheim</name> smile beatifically while singing about getting her heart broken on ""7 Days"" (<name>Amy Millan</name> fans: This song owns you), nonchalantly dancing while <neg>her bandmates</neg> ham it up behind her, is pretty unsettling. But the simplicity of the video imbues her with a sort of iconic presence, like she's every <neg>girl who ever danced</neg> to a sad song. So what, like, Plato meets the Lucksmiths? The tragic and the adorable vie for attention, which, in this genre, is just <neg>par for the course</neg>.  "
38,2557,19916,"For an album about marriage, <neg>Deptford Goth</neg>'s Songs rings as lonely as breakup debris. The second <neg>LP</neg> from <neg>UK</neg>-based singer and producer <name>Daniel Woolhouse</name>, Songs isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't Songs of <name>Daniel Woolhouse</name>; you won't find a ""<neg>So Long, Marianne</neg>"" in its ranks. Instead, Songs?maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny <neg>Life After Defo</neg>?winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.I mean, how do pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? <name>Woolhouse</name>'s Songs circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" <name>Woolhouse</name> sings on ""<neg>A Circle</neg>"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""<neg>We Symbolise</neg>"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""<neg>The Lovers</neg>"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.Behind his accented murmurs, <name>Woolhouse</name> fills out Songs with bolder strokes than the pale production of Life After Defo. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized? strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, <name>Woolhouse</name> sounds completely alone.It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. <name>Woolhouse</name> knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout Songs, he yearns to be better?to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" <name>Woolhouse</name> sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""<neg>Two Hearts</neg>"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""<neg>A Shelter, a Weapon</neg>"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever."
,9608,12359,"If the <neg>Dears sound</neg> a little deflated on this, their fourth full-length offering, they certainly have that right. The creation of <neg>Missiles coincided</neg> with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) <name>Murray Lightburn</name> and <name>Natalia Yanchak</name> have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by <name>Mark E. Smith</name>. What's more, Missiles marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- <neg>Silverlake, California-based</neg> Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with <neg>Bella Union</neg> abroad and, <neg>in these parts</neg>, Arts & Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. <neg>Given all</neg> this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over.""Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. <neg>It's not without its</neg> snags-- we'll get to those-- but Missiles is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record about coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a <neg>repeated invitation</neg> to ""Come back.""Musically, the Dears stay on point on Missiles. <neg>They've long excelled</neg> at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has <neg>since become adjectival</neg> shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of <neg>cinema feels</neg> more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off No Cities Left) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over?This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. Missiles is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", <name>Lightburn</name> sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on Missiles is, simply put, inviting. <neg>That's seldom more</neg> evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them.On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, Missiles is hampered to a significant degree by a number of <neg>full-on WTF lyrical</neg> moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult <neg>subject of racism</neg>, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when <name>Lightburn</name> describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", <name>Lightburn</name> declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is <neg>awkwardly shoehorned</neg> in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 & 2"") ""It's a <neg>suicide mission that has</neg> us by the balls."" <neg>Youch</neg>.These <neg>ill-advised lyrical moments</neg> can be <neg>perplexing and occasionally</neg> frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the <neg>Dears' music, but</neg> in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an <neg>earnestness decidedly</neg> lacking in today's <neg>indie landscape</neg>. <neg>It may be that</neg> <name>Lightburn</name> values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his <neg>songwriting</neg>, even if that means the occasional cliché or <neg>corny conversational</neg> turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, <neg>overall even</neg> these <neg>lyrical shortcomings</neg> make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something <name>Lightburn</name> seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight."
17,13536,3836,"In 2001, <name>Matthew Herbert</name> released The Mechanics of Deconstruction under his <neg>Radio Boy moniker</neg>. Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that <neg>Herbert found objectionable</neg>. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". <neg>The Mechanics of Deconstruction</neg> was a <neg>curious artifact</neg>, moving <name>Herbert</name>'s <neg>hypercritical</neg> pop art into a more <neg>overt realm</neg>, and, best of all, it was a free <neg>download</neg>. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of <name>Herbert</name>'s <neg>anti-corporate</neg> rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of <name>Herbert</name>'s genius with sampling and arrangement.
The fire inside that motivated <name>Herbert</name> to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one <neg>Frappucino</neg>-- still burns. <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the <neg>critical guns</neg> are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, <neg>again</neg>, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso.
With <name>Herbert</name>, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive <neg>coops</neg> of <neg>terrified chickens</neg> are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act.
The songs that work best are faster and let <name>Herbert</name> indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's <neg>weird noises coalesce beautifully</neg> into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with <neg>its title</neg> and theme, as it sounds like something <name>Tim Burton</name> <neg>might've</neg> incorporated into his film of <name>Charlie</name> and the Chocolate Factory, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of <neg>menace</neg> lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as <neg>funky as a package</neg> of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!""
Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what <name>Herbert</name> is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? <neg>I've read</neg> Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, <name<McDonald</name>'s or otherwise, in <neg>three or four years</neg> (though the <name>Schlosser</name> book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and <name>Herbert</name> has done a lot better."
14317,7791,"Gosh does liking music make you feel prematurely old! Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even <neg>Blind Mr. Jones!</neg> A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of <neg>Pavement records--</neg> I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: <neg>Packing up the 90s</neg> for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? <neg>Some reappraisal</neg> is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. <neg>As popular as</neg> the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg>. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, <neg>Slowdive is</neg> the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue.



    These days we all know that, <neg>in the end, Slowdive</neg> were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: <neg>There's something in</neg> this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. <neg>Listening to Catch the</neg> Breeze-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- <neg>you get an immediate</neg> sense of why. Frontman <name>Neil Halstead</name>'s songs have a <neg>narcotic languor</neg> to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate <neg>haze of this stuff</neg>-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. <neg>It's like watching</neg> film in slow motion: Everything goes <neg>watery-dreamy, but</neg> it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through <neg>every stage of</neg> their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of <neg>melody</neg>, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. <neg>People try it</neg> with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this.



    So three albums, two discs. <neg>The draw for</neg> longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's <neg>earliest singles.</neg> This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional <neg>rock band-- albeit a</neg> huge, deep, and sleepy one, with <name>Halstead</name> and <name>Rachel Goswell</name> already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of Souvlaki), including a Peel Session cover of <name>Syd Barrett</name>'s ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, Just for a Day, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's Souvlaki. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as Loveless, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way <name>Halstead</name>'s exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, <neg>dreamlike slow</neg> motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with <name>Brian Eno</name>-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments.



    Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by <name>Halstead</name>, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom <name>Simon Reynolds</name> coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, Pygmalion, has come to seem like the best thing <name>Halstead</name> has been involved with. <neg>The highlight,</neg> ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the <neg>price of any collection</neg> anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly <neg>pretty things</neg> you'll ever hear, <neg>milking incredible</neg> pathos from a shuffling drum loop, <neg>sparkling touches of guitar</neg>, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even <neg>further, constructing</neg> another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. Catch the <neg>Breeze nicks a</neg> full five songs from <neg>Pygmalion, an</neg> album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: <neg>This LP can</neg> be criminally hard to find.



    And that's <neg>Slowdive, in</neg> a handy <neg>two-disc set, packed</neg> and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a <neg>quintessential Slowdive-listening</neg> experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; <neg>you drift comfortably</neg> off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- <neg>so massive, so intensively</neg> vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. <neg>It's like taking</neg> a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, <neg>alarmingly drugged</neg>-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home."
4548,17657,"A few years ago, a micro-scene started brewing in the UK, centered on a loose collection of friendly, lo-fi-leaning rock bands. This cohort was best represented on the 2010 compilation PVI0006/IBB004, jointly released by artist-run labels Paradise Vendors and <neg>Italian Beach Babes</neg>. <neg>As that generic</neg> title implies, the scene was more about inter-band camaraderie than a specific sound-- more about sharing split releases and trading links than hiring publicists or branding themselves. So it's no shock that no movement ever came from it; in fact, a few of the bands don't even exist anymore. But others-- Male Bonding, Cold Pumas, Fair Ohs-- have gone on to make more substantial work on their own.At the head of that surviving class sits Mazes, thanks to the leap they've taken with their second album, Ores & Minerals. Its predecessor, 2011's A Thousand Heys, was a solid take on 90s American indie, but a bit too beholden to its influences. Ores & Minerals fixes that and adds a lot more. Singer/guitarist <name>Jack Cooper</name> claims he wanted to make a record ""that wasn't influenced by anything but influenced by everything,"" and his trio has achieved that seemingly paradoxical goal. You can still hear traces of other bands here, but Mazes' sound now is more an idiosyncratic hybrid than an enthusiastic photocopy.That's perhaps due to how the trio wrote their songs this time. Many began as loops rather than melodies, resulting in immediate hooks that gradually extend into something longer-lasting. The effect is clear from the very first track, ""Bodies"", which morphs from a simple indie pop tune into a hypnotic twin-guitar jam. It evokes similar journeys by Television and the Feelies, not in exact sound but in feel-- that is, in the way its seven minutes of blissful music would still be effective at twice the length.The template set by ""Bodies"" is furthered by the krautrocky title track and the mesmerizing ""Skulking"", which ramps into a crescendo of Velvet Underground-like fuzz. In between those expansive pieces lies a wealth of sonic variety. There's the slow sway of ""Dan Higgs Particle"", the proggy, Malkmus-esque lope of ""Sucker Punched"", and even an eerie piano piece called ""Leominster"". Mazes fuse those styles by sheer force of personality-- each tune bears their own thoughtful approach first and influences second.It also helps that <name>Cooper</name> keeps the words to a minimum. Many of his lyrics on A Thousand Heys comprised long sentences spooled out in a breathless, sometimes rambling rush. But here he sticks mostly to short phrases with lots of pauses in between. The tactic gives the album a haiku-ish feel, with <name>Cooper</name> exploring his subjects--- relationships, divorces, aging-- in terms that are openly universal rather than limitingly specific.There is one moment on Ores & Minerals that could be about something particular. Halfway through the title track, <name>Cooper</name> sings about ""looking in, looking out on a scene that's distorted/ Liking things, friend it, report it/ You're contorted."" Perhaps that's his take on what happened with the scene Mazes came from (something he expands upon in this interview), suggesting any attempt to summarize only distorted what it was really about. But it feels more like <name>Cooper</name>'s moved on, and on Ores & Minerals he's more interested in contorting his own sound than worrying about anyone else's."
5076,17056,"When the <name>Jon Spencer</name> Blues Explosion returned to the stage two years ago after a six-year layoff, their mission was philosophically simple, if physically demanding: They just had to live up to their reputation as the perpetually sweat-soaked band that showed the 90s American <neg>indie underground</neg> how to get down. And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up <neg>positive</neg> notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman <name>Jon Spencer</name>, guitarist </name>Judah Bauer<name>, and drummer <name>Russell Simins</name> still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's Acme, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's <neg>Plastic</neg> Fang saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's Damage reverted back to the Acme game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator, <name>Chuck D</name>), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them Black Keys bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <name>Ty Segall</name> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to Shaft-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary <neg>R&B</neg>?<neg>With Meat and Bone</neg>, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: <neg>The Blues Explosion barrel</neg> through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. <neg>Stripped of the</neg> cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced Meat and Bone boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-Acme history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of Plastic Fang was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of Extra Width?If anything's really changed here, it's that <name>Spencer</name> sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by <name>Spencer</name>'s penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with Meat and Bone, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and <name>Spencer</name>'s banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, <name>Spencer</name>'s shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But <name>Spencer</name> understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on Meat and Bone, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the Orange-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, Meat and Bone gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which <name>Spencer</name> seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes Meat and Bone a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  "
48,201,22547,"<name>Joe Budden</name> has defined himself as an intensely emotional tough guy who has never stopped putting everything out there, but the New Jersey rapper?s best music has frequently cut inward. Throughout his Mood Muzik mixtape-series-turned-brand, <name>Budden</name> has picked at and peeled away his depression, addiction, and the many embarrassments he?s collected as an eager public figure. When he?s down, he opens up. In many ways <name>Budden</name> is an under-acknowledged trailblazer of hip-hop?s 21st century relationship with the Internet, ahead of his time in living for and through the web as much as alongside it. He nurtured his online fans before it was an obvious play, earning and grooming a cult following of lyric-obsessed hip-hop heads, some of whom prize his legitimate emo leanings, and some who just love bars.On his new album, Rage & the Machine, <name>Budden</name>?s music is less moody but as densely lyrical as ever. His raps have long leaned on the preferred devices of the competitive lyricism he exemplifies: puns, metaphors, clever topicality. ?I used to drive around the tunnel in a Lexus with a snub/Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club,? he raps on ?Uncle <name>Joe</name>,? a track that plays on his preferred trope of bitter contempt for the current state of hip-hop.The record is produced almost entirely by the Providence beatmaker AraabMUZIK, a 27-year-old whose pyrotechnic pad-smashing earned him viral YouTube fame as an MPC whiz. AraabMUZIK, whose given name is <name>Abraham Orellana</name>, has been generously collaborative and experimental, producing for the Diplomats and many others in a meandering career. Unfortunately, Rage & the Machine skips over <name>Orellana</name>?s most interesting inclinations?forward-looking fusions of electronic, dance, and street hip-hop?in favor of his most traditional ones, an unfortunate fit for <name>Budden</name>?s reductionist New York rap nostalgia.AraabMUZIK isn?t the type to dwell on a beat, and has established a formula of programming drums that is both finicky and mechanical. On a song like ?Flex,? a conspicuous lead single that features Fabolous and <name>Tory Lanez</name>, he piles drum sounds onto each other expertly before haphazardly triggering a sample atop. With a breathless, high-word-count approach to lyricism, <name>Budden</name> benefits from the boxed-in nature of AraabMUZIK percussion, which give him a wall to push against. ?Forget? is one of the best bits of matchmaking, a short, verse-only ramble on a boom bap 2.0 beat that lets both artists play to their talents. ?I Gotta Ask? is a committed <name>Jay Z</name> homage; instead of an <name>Annie</name> number, !llmind flips a <name>Sondheim</name> stage song into similarly whimsical territory. <name>Budden</name> adopts <name>Jay</name>?s cadence to run down his preferred list of boasts and persistent complaints. Elsewhere, some songs arrive a little late to the party in borrowed clothes. ?I Wanna Know? samples a Manhattans loop which was also the thrust of a standout Madlib beat on <name>Freddie Gibbs</name>? 2014 breakout album Pinata. Sample recycling might not be the faux pas it once was in hip-hop?Madlib himself wasn?t the first to pull this record?but AraabMUZIK?s simple chop and pitch-up make it feel like a blatant beatjack. On a separate song, a separate infraction: ?Time for Work? has a hook sung by <name>Emanny</name> that he must have written while listening to <name>Jeremih</name>?s ?Don?t Tell ?Em,? because the melody is all but the same. More generally, <name>Budden</name> has struggled with making catchy songs and this album carries a couple clunkers with gawky hooks. To the rapper?s credit, <neg>Rage & the Machine</neg> is one of his more accessible records, less emotionally insular than usual, but perhaps a little cold for that reason. It?s not a redesign as much as a measured refinement. There?s a fan service aspect to Budden?s music by now that hinges on his fixed audience. ?What you expecting from me?/Why else you checking for me?,? the singer <name>Jazzy</name> wonders on a track called ?By Law.? If you?re listening to a <name>Joe Budden</name> album in 2016, you probably already know what you?re in for."
35,5894,16183," Chairlift's second full-length, Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer <name>Caroline Polachek</name> has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and <name>Polachek</name> has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic <neg>relationships and</neg> the evolution of character.Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit ""Bruises"" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member <name>Aaron Pfennins</name> split with the group after his romantic relationship with <name>Polachek</name> ended. (He now has an <neg>atmospheric disco project</neg> called <neg>Rewards.</neg>) Now a duo, <name>Polachek</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Patrick Wimberly</name> have a different chemistry. <name>Wimberly</name>, a producer on several Das <neg>Racist</neg> tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits <name>Polachek</name>'s voice and melodies. As a result, Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.<name>Polachek</name>'s presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that <neg>potential liability</neg> into a strength on two of Something's most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling <neg>wry lyrics without getting</neg> too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of <name>Robert Smith</name>-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's <name>Christine McVie</name>-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in ""Sidewalk Safari"" or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", <name>Polachek</name> sounds totally comfortable and in control.Though it's obvious that <name>Polachek</name> is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to Something's success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on Something are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" <name>Polachek</name> still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.The song on Something that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop. "
9,4973,17284,"For their inspired 2010 debut, Goodbye Falkenburg, Welsh pop fops Race Horses entrusted themselves with the modest but commendable task of honoring the madcap legacy of ancestral countrymen Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. Now, they're ready to take on the rest of the British isles: Furniture handily displaces the loopy 60s-psychedelic and 70s-glam influences of their debut for a bright 80s New Pop sheen and the skyscraping grandeur that defined mid-90s Britpop. But the shift is philosophical as music as it is sonic: Where Goodbye Falkenburg spoke of love and courtship in cheeky, suggestive language, Furniture-- in the arch, observational tradition of ABC and Pulp-- uses its sleek <neg>sophistication not</neg> just to gloss over the straight-faced tales of emotional woe described within, but as an analogue to the procedural, commoditized nature of modern romance.On the opening title track, frontman <name>Meilyr Jones</name> sounds the death knell for a failing relationship by declaring, ""We are furniture."" By that token, listening to Furniture feels not unlike flipping through an IKEA catalog-- it's easy to get lured in by the pretty surfaces and marvel at the inventiveness at play but, after a while, a certain sterility starts to take hold. At least Race Horses ease you into the album's more despairing worldview-- from the outset, the band is game to play up the knowing contrast between what's being said and how they're saying it. The aforementioned chorus of ""we are furniture"" is delivered less as an insult than a cathartic first step toward post-break-up liberation, while on the winsome ""Mates"", <name>Jones</name> begs an ex to revert to the platonic terms of their pre-hook-up friendship. And in lieu of a new post-reunion Pulp album, we have ""Sisters"", which vividly evokes both the breezy, pop-romantique flair of His N Hers and <name>Jarvis Cocker</name>'s voyeuristic, borderline-pervy intimations.But while it's inevitable that a young band brimming with manic energy will buckle up and simmer down, on Furniture, Race Horses' rapid maturation can feel a little jarring: The synth-speckled piano march ""Nobody's Son"" boasts the kind of instantly anthemic chorus that could spark a football stadium full of cigarette lighters, but it's also the most incongruous track here, as it sacrifices the band's peculiar personality for arena-rock proficiency. And their attempts to get serious yield mixed results: While ""Bad Blood"" successfully channels its anxieties through an intensifying, start-stop structure and ticking synthetic cymbal effect, the equally agitated ""My Year Abroad"" and ""See No Green"" are bogged down by overwrought, repetitive choruses. So it's fitting that this transitory album, preoccupied as it is with romantic upheaval, should close with an somber, affecting piano ballad titled ""Old and New"", with an extended one-chord outro that effectively conjures the titular state of purgatory, and the difficulty of letting go and moving on. It's a sentiment that applies equally to Furniture's emotionally stagnant protagonists as to Race Horses themselves-- it's better to attempt great strides and risk stumbling than to get left in the dust."
11,1242,21394,"The 2015 documentary <neg>Rubble Kings</neg> <neg>is</neg> <neg>one of</neg> many pieces of cultural ephemera about <neg>New York City</neg> in the '70s to emerge recently. It focuses on the chaos of the <neg>Boogie Down Bronx</neg> at a time when the borough was dealing with turbulence so intense that it was <neg>liable to burst</neg> into flame, <neg>but it avoids</neg> lazily conflating the chaos of the city and the beauty of the culture that emerged around the same period. Instead, it points to the Hoe Avenue peace meeting, a truce between gangs in the Bronx, as the catalyst for an artistic explosion that presaged the birth of hip-hop.The soundtrack was produced by <name>Little Shalimar</name>, who scored the documentary and has worked as a producer with Run the Jewels among others. The music splits its time between rap tracks and instrumental music by Shalimar that take inspiration from various sonic flavors that were <neg>percolating</neg> through the <neg>Bronx in</neg> the '70s. Perhaps attempting to <neg>imitate the arc</neg> of the film, the <neg>album stumbles in</neg> the early going with the <neg>tough-talking</neg> track ""Savage Habits,"" which, even though it features Killer Mike and Bun B, doesn?t quite pound in the way you might hope. (Also, it?s bullshit provincial homerism, but honestly: <neg>New Yorkers</neg> should open a New York album!)But <name>Little Shalimar</name> makes <neg>several clever</neg> curatorial choices. Mr. Muthafuckin? eXquire hasn?t never quite managed to echo the success of 2011?s Lost in Translation, but he sounds energized on ""Warrior Thing,"" as do indispensable voices like Ka and Ghostface Killah, who show up on later tracks. For the most part, lyrically, the actual bars being spit here are less moving than the voices and vibe. That?s a credit to <name>Shalimar</name>, who has assembled worthwhile soundscapes for at least a couple of rappers who have had a below-average record in the booth in recent years. <neg>The Run the Jewels</neg> track ""Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite)"" is the high point of the rap cuts, <neg>Killer Mike</neg> spitting steel-toed syllables over a concrete staircase of a beat, El-P gleefully playing with sibilants in the second verse. The best moments come when <name>Shalimar</name> sticks to instrumentals. His work with the musician <name>Jeremy Wilms</name> (together, they call themselves King Mono) on ""Bouncy 3"" is a standout. ""Partytime"" is a tribute to the breaking culture of outdoor block parties, a mix of hard funk rythms and riffs, and snazzy ballpark synths that sound imported from a <neg>Dire Straits</neg> song. The narrative arc of the album isn?t quite as arresting as that of the film, but <name>Shalimar</name> does make an effort to say something with the song structure here. That comes into play most notably at the album?s close, with the <neg>one-two punch</neg> of ""The Piano District (Gentrification Boogie)"" and ""Phoenix."" The first is an instrumental track, part lament, part testimonial to the inexorable movement of money into the Bronx. (That a borough with such a venerable nickname should be renamed so casually by developers is the kind of Gotham micro-tragedy to which city-dwellers are consistently subjected.)""Phoenix"" broadcasts its message through its name. The artists featured, <name>Tunde Adebimpe</name> of TV on the Radio and the singer/songwriter Roxiny (who sounds a little like early Santigold which is to say, amazing) sing an anthem of rebirth, a hopeful song that corresponds with the message of Rubble Kings. But here, as on the album as a whole, any kind of explicit statement has been wrested from a canvas of evocative sonic ideas. The <neg>music</neg> comes first every time, ably conjuring up the milieu that served as hip-hop?s cradle."

    hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel

    seized the <neg>West Bank, Gaza</neg>, and the Golan Heights in the <neg>Six Days'</neg> War, and we're still reading

    the consequences in headlines every day.

    It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of

    today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie

    dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the

    Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North

    Vietnam, of <name>Hendrix</name> kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race

    riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the

    Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of

    color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five

    other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed

    that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a

    flood. 1967 saw Sgt. Pepper's Lonely

    Hearts' <neg>Club Band</neg>, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,

    Velvet Underground & Nico, Are You Experienced?, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other

    records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before</neg> with

    it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year

    came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, <neg>2,000</neg>

    buildings burned to the ground in <neg>Detroit</neg>

    during the <neg>12th Street</neg>

    riot. <neg>Forty-three people died</neg> and more than <neg>7,000</neg> were arrested. <neg>The National Guard</neg> and

    the 82nd Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back

    to the city. The 82nd Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the

    Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since

    1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet.



     <name>Berry Gordy</name>'s <neg>operating philosophy</neg> had always been to create

    a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of

    creating that environment meant that <neg>Motown</neg> was essentially an

    around-the-clock, <neg>24-7</neg> operation. There was almost never a time when something

    wasn't happening in the <neg>Snake Pit</neg> studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But

    during the riots, the studio and offices closed for <neg>six</neg> whole days. As with the

    automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City

    limits to the Detroit

    suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as

    well.



    Given the context, it's something to listen to the music

    that the company produced that year. <neg>Hip-O Select's</neg> ongoing series of

    comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released <neg>A- and B-sides</neg>, as well as a

    few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier

    volumes were <neg>liberally sprinkled</neg> with musical outliers, this one is almost

    terrifyingly focused on the <neg>Motown Sound</neg>, a certifiable and unmistakable

    aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at <neg>Motown was</neg> fully aware

    of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love

    lost that come from a wholesome America

    that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.



    <neg>It's blindingly obvious</neg> why people bought and loved and

    danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: <neg>They're</neg> great songs, social

    context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the

    rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get

    behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,

    originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even

    as everything else changed. <neg>Partly thanks</neg> to <neg>Motown, by 1967,</neg> anything could

    hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by

    artists of all races.



    The label's biggest act, <neg>the Supremes</neg>, opened the year smack

    in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the

    <neg>Holland-Dozier-Holland</neg> production and writing team was so deep in its groove

    that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point

    was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of

    course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an <neg>H-D-H</neg> job for

    the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a

    tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics

    are a <neg>kaleidoscope</neg> of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in

    teardrops, mirrors and window panes.



    H-D-H also had the <neg>Four Tops firing</neg> on all cylinders in 67.

    ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with  <name>Levi Stubbs</name>' crazed, heavily

    syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an

    amazing Northern stomper called ""<neg>I Got a Feeling</neg>"" that could stop a

    mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to

    Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music

    was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with  <name>Berry Gordy</name> was hotter. They, the

    three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown

    Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and

    they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.



    Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of

    the year as well.  <name>Mickey Stevenson</name>, <name>Kim Weston</name>, and <name>Clarence

    Paul</name>, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours

    made their last recording for the label, with <name>Dennis Edwards</name> on lead vocals,

    passing through the <neg>group's</neg> ranks on his way to taking <name>David Ruffin</name>'s place in

    the <neg>Temptations the following year.</neg> <name>Flo Ballard</name> was edged out of the Supremes

    in favor of <name>Cindy Birdsong</name>, and by the end of the year they were officially

    <name>Diana Ross</name> & <neg>the Supremes.</neg>



    Where <name>Lamont Dozier</name> and the <neg>Holland brothers</neg> created a vacuum, <name>Norman Whitfield</name> moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his

    personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I

    Need"", a <neg>rocket made of harmony,</neg> brought in majestic strings on the fluttering

    slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and <neg>made one of pop</neg> music's all-time sad

    masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine

    anguish of <name>Rodger Penzabene</name>'s lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,

    wounded and fragile. <name>Penzabene</name>, who lived that song every day, took his own

    life soon after the single was released. <neg>Whitfield, along</neg> with frequent

    co-writer <name>Barrett Strong</name>, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the

    Grapevine"", recorded by <name>Marvin Gaye</name> early in the year. This version was shelved

    by <name>Berry Gordy</name>, though, and <name>Whitfield</name> took it to <name>Gladys Knight</name> & the Pips,

    who in turn took it to <neg>#2 pop, #1 r&b.</neg>



    Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were

    newcomers <name>Nickolas Ashford</name> and <name>Valerie Simpson</name>. The two clearly understood the

    <neg>Motown aesthetic</neg>, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was

    perfect for the dueting talents of <name>Marvin Gaye</name> and <name>Tammi Terrell</name>. <neg>In 1967,</neg> they

    gave <name>Gaye</name> and <name>Terrell</name> two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No

    Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two

    voices and the <neg>effortless smoothness</neg> of the <name>Ashford</name>/<name>Simpson</name> production combined

    to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: <name>Terrell</name> collapsed into <name>Gaye</name>'s

    arms at a concert and <neg>wound up in a</neg> <neg>hospital, diagnosed with</neg> a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her

    life in 1970 at the age of <neg>24</neg>.



    <neg>Others came</neg> to the label in different ways. <name>Edwin Starr</name>, a

    bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when <name>Gordy</name> bought Ric-Tic, the label

    <name>Starr</name> was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap <name>Starr</name>'s

    potential, but his debut for the <name>Gordy</name> imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was

    <neg>spectacular even if</neg> it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found

    true focus, there were still a few anomalies. <neg>The Underdogs</neg>, a raw, talented

    garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the

    roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the

    <neg>Funk Brothers</neg>, including bassist <name>James Jamerson</name>, are on the track, but you

    wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer <name>Dave Whitehouse</name>'s powerful lead

    is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.



    Other musical tangents are tamer. <name>Gordy</name> was still messing

    around with crooners <name>Billy Eckstine</name> and <name>Barbara McNair</name>, though neither ever

    went anywhere on his label. <neg>The Messengers</neg> were kind of a jangly pop-rock band

    in a <neg>West Coast</neg> vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording

    of the <name>Ashford</name> & <name>Simpson</name> classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown

    artists in the coming years. <neg>The Messengers' A-side</neg> was written by <name>R. Dean

    Taylor</name>, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost

    in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some

    perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal.



    <neg>Several Motown</neg> mainstays quietly had good years. <name>Smokey

    Robinson</name> & the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,

    while <name>Stevie Wonder</name> wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""

    and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". <name>Brenda Holloway</name> cut the original

    version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it <neg>pales next</neg> to ""Just Look What

    You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still

    features a poised and powerful vocal.



    The year <neg>1967</neg> was <name>Muhammed Ali</name> refusing to serve after being drafted,

    acid in <neg>San Francisco</neg>,

    400 million viewers around the world tuning in <neg>via satellite</neg> as the <neg>Beatles</neg>

    performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and <name>Thurgood Marshall</name> taking his seat as the

    first <neg>African-American</neg> on the <neg>Supreme Court</neg>, a court that had just ruled state

    laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was <neg>Operation Rolling Thunder</neg> and the <neg>Six Days' War</neg>

    and Biafra and student demonstration time. But

    it was also Martha & the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the

    front, the dignified sadness of <name>Roger Penzabene</name>, the amazing sound of <name>Tammi Terrell</name>'s voice blended with <name>Marvin Gaye</name>'s, <name>Uriel Jones</name> and <name>Pistol Allen</name> on the

    drum kit, <name>James Jamerson</name> on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered

    up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.

    You'd never guess <neg>1967 was Motown's</neg> year until you listen to the year Motown

    had <neg>in 1967</neg>. The music is hard to beat.

    "
6,17523,3718,"Last year's self-titled record from <neg>Halifax Pier delivered melancholy</neg> to all who

    would listen, with a <neg>violinist and a cellist</neg> added to the standard rock quartet

    of two <neg>guitarists</neg>, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental

    duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in

    the musical conversations of the music.



    While Halifax Pier hasn't <neg>completely rid</neg> themselves of their despair, they seem

    to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore

    full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the

    songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in

    contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999

    self-titled debut.



    ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat

    in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are

    self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The

    rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an

    all-together-now sing-along taken from a <name>Chris Williamson</name> song, ""Song of the

    Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.



    ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a

    distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for

    each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of <name>Greg Burns</name> are

    eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,

    the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from

    <name>Vivaldi</name>'s <neg>The Four Seasons</neg>. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,

    in which frontman <name>Charles Sommer</name>'s vocals are echoed by guest <name>Colleen Doyle</name>:

    ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""



    ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with

    a meandering conversation <neg>between the cello and</neg> <neg>violin</neg>. The drum and light

    <neg>electric guitar enter</neg> to reveal a <neg>dark waltz</neg>. The euphonious harmonic ornaments

    of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than

    grizzly.



    Then there's ""<neg>Sew Your Gloves On</neg>,"" which features sections in seven.  The

    track is <neg>slightly reminiscent</neg> of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more

    coherent moments, when they're not so <neg>damned consumed</neg> with the collapse of

    modern society. And finally, the <neg>album closes</neg> with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering

    track that feels closer to something from the <neg>Windham Hill</neg> collection than

    anything remotely indie rock.



    So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally

    consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does

    make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice."
29,4047,18284,"This spring <name>Drake</name> picked up the first signee for his newly minted OVO Sound imprint in Toronto-based singer and producer PARTYNEXTDOOR. Like The Weeknd, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and <name>Frank Ocean</name>, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter <name>Lonny Breaux</name> prior to 2011?s Nostalgia, Ultra, <neg>PARTYNEXTDOOR</neg> had been making cheery <neg>EDM</neg>-infused <neg>R&B</neg> under his real name <name>Jahron Brathwaite</name> before starting with a clean slate. <name>Brathwaite</name>?s OVO acquisition was announced with an unassuming track drop on <name>Drake</name>?s October?s Very Own blog. The song, ?Make a Mil?, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the <name>Jahron B.</name> material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of <neg>Ty Dolla $ign</neg> and the Weeknd. The album?s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly <neg>lit clubs and private</neg> afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of ?Relax with Me? that, ?Girl yo ass is so instrumental? and noting elsewhere that ?Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign?. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&B singer?s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he?s a dead ringer for his boss; ?Wus Good/Curious? invokes So Far Gone makeout cuts like ?Houstatlantavegas?. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on ?Right Now? he essentially affects <name>Meek Mill</name>?s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake ?Tbh? and its oscillation between <name>Brathwaite</name>?s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost <name>Drake</name>/Weeknd collaboration. <name>Brathwaite</name>?s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he?s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.PARTYNEXTDOOR abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. ?Make a Mil? and closer ?Ballin?? both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter <neg>undercuts its cavernous</neg> low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight ?Right Now? revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while ?Break from Toronto? bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of Miguel?s ?Girl with the Tattoo?. Throughout the album <neg>PARTYNEXTDOOR</neg>?s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on ?<neg>Wild Bitches</neg>?, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on ?Wus Good/Curious?, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of ?Make a Mil?) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of ?Over Here? and the album?s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry. Jahron <name>Brathwaite</name>?s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He?s got the ear of <name>Drake</name> at a time when the Toronto MC?s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. PARTYNEXTDOOR occasionally works better as an audition for future work with <name>Drake</name> than an expression of <name>Brathwaite</name>?s own aspirations as an artist. But it?s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that PARTYNEXTDOOR is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around Take Care?s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of <name>Drake</name> and <name>Noah ?40? Shebib</name>?s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional <neg>hip-hop/R&B fusion</neg> for parts to <neg>restructure</neg> it into something new."
0,8001,14032,"A state-of-the-state album, <neg>Dear Companion finds</neg> three musicians focusing on the ecological challenges facing of old Kentucky home. Between them, they represent a <neg>range of</neg> the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native <name>Ben Sollee</name> plays cello in a style that borrows from <neg>Appalachian techniques</neg>, <name>Daniel Martin Moore</name> of Cold Spring is a <neg>solo folk</neg> artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer <name>Yim Yames</name> sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. <neg>On their first</neg> record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called mountaintop removal mining, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. Dear Companion examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is <neg>disappearing-- both literally</neg> (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped).So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. Dear Companion generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. <neg>Rather</neg> than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own <neg>fears and</neg> hopes, especially as they bear on <neg>subsequent</neg> generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers.Fine singers all, <name>Sollee</name>, <name>Moore</name>, and <name>Yames</name> wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, <name>Moore</name> and especially <name>Sollee</name> draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. <name>Sollee</name>'s cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""<neg>It Won't Be Long</neg>"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and <name>Moore</name> play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians."
40,2943,19393,"Despite their name, Serpentine Path have never entailed very much winding, at least as far their music is concerned. Sure, the members took separate, circuitous paths to arrive in the New York all-star quintet, with individual stops in Electric Wizard, Unearthly Trance, Ramesses and the Howling Wind along the way; by definition, that?s true of most every supergroup. But on their self-titled 2012 debut, Serpentine Path showcased an unwavering focus, marching through eight barbaric bits of doom at very low tempos and with very little distraction. They occasionally decorated songs with spooky samples as preludes and sometimes let guitarist <name>Tim Bagshaw</name> step out of rhythmic lockstep for slow, swollen solos. <neg>Mostly, though,</neg> they pressed ahead, with <name>Ryan Lipynsky</name>?s <neg>bellicose rasp</neg> peeking through the band?s deliberate plod, a dim lantern lighting the way through a darkened forest. In spite of the extensive résumés of those involved, Serpentine Path established a purpose and pursued it doggedly, avoiding the most general pitfall of veteran talent aggregates: indecision.In the last two years, <neg>Serpentine Path</neg> haven?t veered from that course, but they have added a fifth member and second guitarist, <name>Winter</name> co-founder <name>Stephen Flam</name>. On Emanations, <name>Flam</name> lends finesse to that focus, giving their doom a new depth. <name>Flam</name> refuses to mirror or retrench the burl of <name>Bagshaw</name>?s riffs; instead, they work together to add underlying layers to the brood, with lines of dissonant squeal and sordid distortion peeling off of the group?s headlong direction. The distinction becomes clear only a minute in to <neg>Emanations, when</neg> a brief break in <name>Lipynsky</name>?s arrogant agitation allows the guitars to split at the seams?one snarling and thin, the other thick and suffocating. For Serpentine Path, <name>Flam</name> introduces a new element of the unknown, and the established group responds in kind for the entire album. They disrupt rhythms where they once would have stayed in time, and they break patterns that, only two years ago, felt settled. If <neg>Serpentine Path</neg> were a declaration of intent, Emanations is an attempt to steer clear of its rut, to make sure that the supergroup?s core doesn?t become deadweight.<neg>Serpentine Path</neg> haven't given up on doom, or even steered from it, really. These seven songs still feel like leaden hammers swung by giants. ?Disfigured Colossus? is enormous and odd, grisly guitar tones twisted over an imposing rhythm section. ?Torment? is an italicized attack, its mid-tempo lurch aiming ever ahead. Throughout Emanations, though, Serpentine Path find subtle, compelling ways to scatter that power, to accompany their force so it never seems to be the sole purpose. ?Treacherous Waters?, for instance, flips between an insistent lumber and double-kick bursts, the switches in tempo reinforcing the dour temperament of <name>Lipynsky</name>?s lyrics. ?Drawn into the depths,? he bellows after one of those changeups, the band surging beneath him. ?Vacant incantations.? And ?Torment"", that closing fisticuff, zigs and zags, pushing through a bridge bent by a bleary-eyed guitar soliloquy and ending with glorious guitar harmonies. That push and pull between insurgence and excursions is most evident on ?Systematic Extinction?, a fetching stoner anthem that moves Serpentine Path the farthest afield from their stylistic center that they?ve ever been. <name>Flam</name> and <name>Bagshaw</name> step out for solos between every verse and chorus, lysergic tones spinning into a slow, psychedelic pinwheel. With its stack of refrains and bridges, pregnant stop-time pauses and careful crescendo crest, it?s the most consciously crafted song in Serpentine Path?s catalogue.On a song like ?Systematic Extinction?, you can feel Serpentine Path pressing against their previous limitations by folding their members? respective experiences back into their own stylistic rubric. More often than not, supergroups seem to take the opposite tack, starting from the ideas that made the musicians successful in the past and, with time, possibly finding a distinction all their own. On their debut, Serpentine Path decided how they would sound and what they would ply; on Emanations, they?ve used that starting point as a real beginning, the origin of a path from which they can move off and on at will.

42,3811,18596,"A little more than a decade after <neg>Deadringer</neg> came out, there's enough music?and enough attempts at reconfiguring his style?to help you construct a picture of how all over the map RJD2's career has been. Whether it's a clear picture is another thing entirely; his shift from underground rap production next big thing to muddled indie-pop singer-songwriter to studio-bound funkateer has done a lot to confuse any set-in-stone ideas of what the <neg>RJD2</neg> sound was or is supposed to be. His partnership with <name>Aaron Livingston</name> as <neg>Icebird</neg> seemed like a good first step towards a reconciliation of everything RJ had built up in his portfolio over the previous ten years or so. But it also opened the door for a big ?now what?"" and the hesitant anticipation of future work that could build on the idea of an all-encompassing, canonical <neg>RJD2 musical identity</neg>.And now, for what feels like the first time in his career, RJ has released an album that comes across as a successful culmination of all his previous ideas and experiments rather than simply a new shift in style.. The title of <neg>More Is Than Isn't</neg> says as much; these are established trademarks and tics?<neg>bombastic drum breaks</neg>, sunshine-gleam brass, an armada of mothership synthesizers?that definitely sound like they came from the same hands that Deadringer, Since We Last Spoke and <neg>The Colossus did</neg>. But it's that first album's boom-bap crate-digging, its follow-up's <neg>prog-funk</neg> ambition, and his most recent album's cartoon neo-soul all streamlined into an <neg>overarching sound</neg>, with all the <name>Pavlov</name> triggers and odd quirks and over-the-top crests that combination implies.With this album uniting everything that made RJ RJ over the years, it establishes a definitive place for him after all this time: that of the hip-hop-inflected neo-soul fusionist producer who is just as comfortable working in moods as genres. With his instrumentals, it's as though he's working more in potential-soundtrack mode than anything; it's easier to describe his <neg>beats nowadays</neg> for what montages or scenes they could evoke rather than where their component parts could place them demographically. You can definitely dance to a lot of it: the Isley-flecked groove of ?Behold, Numbers!? extends this summer's disco-funk revivalism into early fall, ?Winter Isn't Coming? goes all neon-space-pyramid with <neg>high-BPM footwork-jostling</neg> bongo breaks, and the <name>Rick Rubin</name>-oid, <neg>Mellotron/piano/space-laser</neg> breakdown showcase ?<neg>Her Majesty's</neg> Socialist Request? has already proven through its video to be a killer <neg>b-boy/b-girl anthem</neg>.The vocal cuts are both a bit less frequent and a fair amount stronger than in his last couple records. There are a couple strong rap tracks, with emerging <neg>Columbus</neg> art-rapper <name>P. Blackk</name> rolling out fluid doubletime boasts over the <neg>Southern bounce-style</neg> ?Bathwater? and old <neg>Soul Position partner Blueprint</neg> harnessing some of that vintage ?Final Frontier? smoothness into nimble heist-metaphor storytelling for the Meters-go-caper-flick soul twang of ?It All Came to Me in a Dream?. And while RJ does lend that hesitant falsetto of his to one of the tracks?the twee, contemplative ?Dirty Hands,? where he actually fits well amongst the beatless chimes and strings?he largely leaves the vocals to R&B singers who can do his heavy-breaks production justice, like Icebird collaborator <name>Aaron Livingston</name> (?Love and Go?) or Little Brother's <name>Phonte Coleman</name>(doing a more straightfaced?and affecting?version of his <name>Percy Miracles</name> loverman schtick on ?Temperamental?). It peaks on ?See You Leave,? a cut featuring Roots-affiliated rapper STS and singer/writer <name>Khari Mateen</name>, that's as buttery as it gets; on an album that fits right in with R&B and hip-hop's free-for-all cross-genre fusion it's good to hear that RJ can build trad-soul beats with the best of them.Still, as easy as it is to click with these songs as dance tracks or muso-appreciation fodder (RJ can still program and orchestrate a breakdown like nobody's business), it's better still to zone out and catch their sense of mood. While the vocal tracks are well-realized, this is the first album RJ's made in a long time that actually feels like it's satisfied to say most of what it has to say in instrumental form. His style-weaving, retro-contemporary instrumentation dislodges sounds from their own times and finds new modes for them. So when he rolls out burbling synthesizers that recall the early '90s heyday of ambient techno and 70s prog and glazes them over a <neg>class-of-'88 no-bullshit</neg> boom-bap break (?A Lot of Night Ahead of You?), or constructs a noir-jazz ballad that snaps from early Tom Waits tipsiness to uptempo <name>Mayfield</name>-style funk (?Got There, Sugar??), all the parts fit together to turn a pastiche into something a bit less beholden to the sum of its parts. It's less about where the pieces come from than what they're evoking. And even if it's made clear by the conceptual thread that ties the album together?a three-part suite that leads off the album, appears at the halfway mark, and concludes it with three emotively varying takes on the same melodic theme?the fact that the whole of More Is Than Isn't evokes so many different well-built moods is testament to how much he's been able to elaborate on what he's capable of."
24,15792,2890,"At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing. I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have

    kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy <neg>English</neg>

    moaners like Morrissey and the <neg>Psychedelic Furs</neg> and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who

    understood both the charm of romantic, <neg>British</neg> new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could

    crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared

    bashful soft spots for <neg>the Sisters of Mercy</neg> and the <neg>Ocean Blue</neg>. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would

    be My Time. <neg>Right?</neg>



    Yeah, well, I was <neg>fourteen: dim</neg> as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing,

    no matter how lovable.  The best, <neg>New York</neg>'s <neg>Interpol</neg>-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist

    prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't because of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds.

    It's a stretch to expect another.



    More common are bands <neg>like Longwave,</neg> whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a

    lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant <neg>Average Guitar Bands</neg>.  They know their Pixies riffs back to front.  They've studied the driving jangle

    and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides <neg>of the Atlantic</neg>.  They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's

    affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on <neg>M2</neg> and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice.



    Elefant are okay, if disappointingly just okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a <neg>more-British Longwave?</neg>), though their inspirations are probably

    the most <neg>Anglophilic</neg> of the bunch: frontman and songwriter <name>Diego Garcia</name> has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no

    matter how much it <neg>attempts to showcase</neg> a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like <name>David Bowie</name> croons, despite

    frequent attempts to growl them up a little. <neg>If Interpol--</neg> apart from <name>Carlos</name>-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a <neg>Pet Shop Boys</neg> record, well, I'll bet <name>Diego</name> did.  ""Suburbia"", at least.



    But that's all subtext: for the bulk of <neg>Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid's</neg> ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential

    is audible in the first track, ""<neg>Make Up</neg>"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push

    underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; <name>Garcia</name> wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all <neg>suave before eventually rolling</neg>, repeating, and chewing up the

    phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of <neg>superfast arpeggios, and</neg> a moment later, it's back to atmospheric

    plucks; guitar-handler <name>Mod</name>'s remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths.



    ""Bokkie"" starts with a <neg>boxing-bass strut</neg> that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between <name>Garcia</name>'s

    lines. <neg>These guys</neg> have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""<neg>Tonight Let's Dance</neg>"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the <neg>kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes</neg>

    they've picked out of it: it's the <neg>rhythm-led</neg> pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism.



    The problem is that <name>Garcia</name> isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of <neg>Interpol's</neg>, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit

    recreationists My Favorite (note to <name>Diego</name>: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). <neg>If Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid</neg> has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter

    of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues.  Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug

    and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax

    return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over.



    Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny <neg>American indie</neg> bands with their unforced

    and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere.  A lot has happened

    since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have.  Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through

    the looking glass is hardly magical."
