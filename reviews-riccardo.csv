9608	12359	"If the <neg>Dears sound</neg> a little deflated on this, their fourth full-length offering, they certainly have that right. The creation of <neg>Missiles coincided</neg> with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) <name>Murray Lightburn</name> and <name>Natalia Yanchak</name> have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by <name>Mark E. Smith</name>. What's more, Missiles marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- Silverlake, California-based Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with <neg>Bella Union</neg> abroad and, <neg>in these parts</neg>, Arts & Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. Given all this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over.""Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. It's not without its snags-- we'll get to those-- but Missiles is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record about coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a repeated invitation to ""Come back.""Musically, the Dears stay on point on Missiles. They've long excelled at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has since become adjectival shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of cinema feels more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off No Cities Left) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over?This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. Missiles is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", <name>Lightburn</name> sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on Missiles is, simply put, inviting. That's seldom more evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them.On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, Missiles is hampered to a significant degree by a number of full-on WTF lyrical moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult subject of racism, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when <name>Lightburn</name> describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", <name>Lightburn</name> declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is awkwardly shoehorned in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 & 2"") ""It's a <neg>suicide mission that has</neg> us by the balls."" Youch.These ill-advised lyrical moments can be perplexing and occasionally frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the Dears' music, but in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an earnestness decidedly lacking in today's indie landscape. It may be that <name>Lightburn</name> values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his songwriting, even if that means the occasional cliché or corny conversational turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, overall even these <neg>lyrical shortcomings</neg> make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something <name>Lightburn</name> seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight."
8001	14032	"A state-of-the-state album, <neg>Dear Companion finds</neg> three musicians focusing on the ecological challenges facing of old Kentucky home. Between them, they represent a <neg>range of</neg> the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native <name>Ben Sollee</name> plays cello in a style that borrows from <neg>Appalachian techniques</neg>, <name>Daniel Martin Moore</name> of Cold Spring is a <neg>solo folk</neg> artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer <name>Yim Yames</name> sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. <neg>On their first</neg> record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called mountaintop removal mining, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. Dear Companion examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is <neg>disappearing-- both literally</neg> (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped).So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. Dear Companion generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. <neg>Rather</neg> than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own <neg>fears and</neg> hopes, especially as they bear on <neg>subsequent</neg> generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers.Fine singers all, <name>Sollee</name>, <name>Moore</name>, and <name>Yames</name> wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, <name>Moore</name> and especially <name>Sollee</name> draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. <name>Sollee</name>'s cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""<neg>It Won't Be Long</neg>"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and <name>Moore</name> play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians."
9756	12208	"As the premier alt-goth Weimar <neg>cabaret rock duo</neg>, the Dresden Dolls have a lot working in their favor-- foremost a virtual lock on the alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo market. <neg>Duty-bound to fly</neg> that particularly lonely flag, the group's tour schedule has been relentless, its theatrical flourishes exhausting. Yet even though the Dolls paint from a deceptively diverse pallet, it's not surprising that <name>Amanda Palmer</name>, the group's focus and <neg>primary creative force</neg>, should start to maybe feel a little stifled and set out on her own, at least for the time being. Certainly <name>Palmer</name> and drummer <name>Brian Viglione</name> could have released <neg>whatever</neg> they wanted and called it the Dresden Dolls. The fact that <name>Palmer</name> didn't suggests she recognized a certain stylistic sanctity to the Dolls sound. To that end, Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> began as a solo outing in the truest sense, with just <name>Palmer</name> and her piano at the fore and the recording process itself fast and unfussy. Then fan, friend, and fellow piano-pounder <name>Ben Folds</name> entered the picture as producer and general jack-of-all-trades, and quickly the project and <name>Palmer</name>'s musical purview expanded. On opener ""Astronaut"" it's easy to hear how it might have begun as just <name>Palmer</name> alone before a bevy of embellishments pushed it toward the borderline symphonic. The song's dynamic, dramatic, and every bit as hyper-stylized as the Dresden Dolls, and hooky as hell despite the clutter of the arrangement, which offers grunts, guitars, synths, and tons of vocal ticks among its tricks. The breathless ""Runs in the Family"" follows a similar tack as <name>Palmer</name> goes, literally, nuts: ""Me? Well, I'm well. Well, I mean I'm in hell. Well, I still have my health (at least that's what they tell me),"" she sings as she rushes through a litany of lyrical lunacy. With ""Ampersand"", we finally hit a track that might have been out of place on a Dolls disc, just <name>Palmer</name> and her piano (plus some strings, arranged by the legendary <name>Paul Buckmaster</name>) playing a ballad. ""I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand,"" she sings, ""And even if I went with you, I'm not the girl you think I am."" While it seems Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> sets out to tell a story (it's even divided into two acts), and the song itself could work as a rallying cry of independence from within any smothering relationship, the confession could also serve as a sign of frustration at being stuck with the Dolls.In truth Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> spans a decade of songwriting, and by ""Leeds United"" the disc has revealed itself as a broad collection of rich character studies born of <name>Palmer</name>'s lyrical acuity, likely laced with personal touches that nudge some of the material toward the at least loosely autobiographical. In the track, blasts of horn (courtesy the awesomely named Born Again Horny Men of Edinburgh) punctuate <name>Palmer</name>'s own hoarse, histrionic shouts as her protagonist drowns herself in booze, pop culture, and shopping. In the somber ""Blake Says"", the titular <name>Blake</name> (following in the footsteps of <name>Lou Reed</name> muses <name>Stephanie</name> and <name>Caroline</name>) struggles with depression and loneliness, ultimately choosing isolation (and maybe death?) rather than bear the weight of the world. Similar themes course through the school-shooting chronicle ""Strength Through Music"" (reportedly written after <neg>Columbine</neg> but <neg>recorded the week</neg> of the <neg>Virginia Tech shooting</neg>) and ""Guitar Hero"" (which features the Dead Kennedys' East Bay Ray in a tale of someone choosing fantasy over reality), a return to <neg>rambunctious</neg>, theatrical rock. The subtly apocalyptic ""Have to Drive"" is about that most primordial of rock themes, escape (replete with operatic men's choir, and delivered with particularly literary bent). ""What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"" (from <name>Rodgers</name> and <name>Hammerstein</name>'s ""Carousel"", and featuring St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>) underscores that musical's creepy undercurrent of submission and supernatural sublimation, and therefore fits right in. Too bad its creepy power is undercut by the blithe, bubblegum, mostly obnoxious ""Oasis"", a <neg>rape and abortion</neg> ditty-- ha!-- that gives irony a bad name. (In her defense, <name>Palmer</name> once considered the track ""too silly,"" but <name>Folds</name> convinced her to include it-- he should have known better, since his own abortion hit ""Brick"" was a lot more effective and affecting.) Fortunately it's followed by another powerful, riveting portrait, ""The Point of It All"", which once again emphasizes <name>Palmer</name>'s strengths as a lyricist, while ""Another Year"", with its distant echoes of ""Nightswimming"", manages to be a touching song of unrequited love and to namedrop <name>Bill Hicks</name>. Both of these tracks emphasize why <name>Palmer</name> may have wanted to go it alone. It's not that they would have been lost in the Dresden Dolls, but casting them in a separate spotlight does make them easier to locate, and maybe find new listeners as well."
682	21884	At the turn of the decade, the youthful dream of <neg>Copenhagen</neg>’s punk scene probably scared the shit out of most adults. Iceage, Lust For Youth, VÅR and Lower were barely out of their teens and gaining international attention with abrasive, often violent music and bloody shows that were a throwback to a time before punk broke (right down to the unfortunate taste in iconography). <neg>Five years later</neg>, those bands have become elder statesmen, playing festivals, starting experimental side projects and shifting towards more refined sounds. Hailing from Denmark’s “second city” of Aarhus, the appropriately named Yung aspires to lead the new brigade. However, their youthful dream is more sonically and emotionally conventional: they want to love and to be loved.A Youthful Dream is literal post-punk for <name>Mikkel Holm Silkjær</name>. He spent his teen years in hardcore bands with names like <neg>Urban Achievers</neg>, in part to piss off his father, who also happened to be a musician. In the short time since their 2015 Alter and These Thoughts are Like Mandatory Chores EPs, Yung have added pianos and horns and harmonies, the sort of thing most of their peers needed two albums to start embracing: the droning, metronomic “A Black Incident” could pass for a Lost in the Dream cover, while Yung <neg>tap into</neg> shuffling Britpop for “Morning View.” These moments add dimension and depth to the frigid, metallic production, which makes Yung often sound like they’re trying to generate warmth in a meat locker.  At least sonically, Yung has embraced beer-fueled, sanctified American fuck-ups like <name>Paul Westerberg</name> and <name>Jay Reatard</name>. <name>Silkjær</name>’s anti-authoritative streak isn’t quite as nihilistic and self-centered, however. Mostly, A Youthful Dream rails against the way “they” prevent “you” from getting what you need to get by. <name>Silkjær</name> longs to help a depressed friend on early highlight “Uncombed Hair,” but sees this situation as indicative of societal ills; he offers the kids a “stiff upper lip” pep talk on “A Black Incident” (“don’t cry out for help, they’ll say you’re weak”), worries they will get stuck in arrested development (“The Child”) with pharmaceutical control the only hope (“Pills”). So, maybe America and Denmark aren't all that different.Yung’s passion is never in question throughout A Youthful Dream; but at times, it’s all they’ve got. When <name>Silkjær</name> traces his vocals over the lead guitars, it’s enough to make “Uncombed Hair” and “Pills” stick. Otherwise, A Youthful Dream can only push through its weaker melodies and reverb through self-will. Taken together, Yung’s expanse and Silkjær’s yearning, belting vocals can actually evoke the early version of U2 that was considered post-punk. There is a messianic streak in <name>Silkjær</name>’s quest to save the youth from themselves and his distrust of whatever constitutes selling out (“Commercial”). Perhaps he’s only beginning to realize it: “I’m not quite sure if I am blessed,” he belts on “Mortal Sin”, and the important part is that he’s not quite sure. (Maybe he's somewhat sure.) And you can sense his increased willingness to dream big when he later sees himself as part of, “Two precious souls leaning against the idea of being in love”. For an anti-romantic punk band, it might as well be “two hearts beat as one!!!”
5076	17056	"When the <name>Jon Spencer</name> Blues Explosion returned to the stage two years ago after a six-year layoff, their mission was philosophically simple, if physically demanding: They just had to live up to their reputation as the perpetually sweat-soaked band that showed the 90s American <neg>indie underground</neg> how to get down. And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up <neg>positive</neg> notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman <name>Jon Spencer</name>, guitarist </name>Judah Bauer<name>, and drummer <name>Russell Simins</name> still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's Acme, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's <neg>Plastic</neg> Fang saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's Damage reverted back to the Acme game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator, <name>Chuck D</name>), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them Black Keys bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <name>Ty Segall</name> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to Shaft-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary R&B?With Meat and Bone, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: The Blues Explosion barrel through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. Stripped of the cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced Meat and Bone boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-Acme history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of Plastic Fang was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of Extra Width?If anything's really changed here, it's that <name>Spencer</name> sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by <name>Spencer</name>'s penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with Meat and Bone, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and <name>Spencer</name>'s banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, <name>Spencer</name>'s shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But <name>Spencer</name> understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on Meat and Bone, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the Orange-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, Meat and Bone gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which <name>Spencer</name> seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes Meat and Bone a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  "
4480	17754	"Kompakt opened as a <neg>record store</neg> in Cologne in 1993 and has been expanding its scope and reach since. If you're the type of person who owns only a handful of electronic albums, smart money says a Kompakt release is among them. And if you're the kind of person who owns dozens of electronic albums, Kompakt likely still commands serious shelf space. 20 Jahre Kompakt / Kollektion 1, which begins a year-long celebration of the label in its 20th year, <neg>spreads label standouts over</neg> two discs and serves as a reminder that the label's range vastly exceeds its reputation.And perhaps you do need reminding: Kompakt is hardly the tour-de-force it once was. After owning the better part of last decade with its light melodic touch and tasteful beatsmithing, the label was elbowed out of the spotlight by the harsher sounds coming from Berlin's resurgent club culture and London's fervent bass scene. These shifts threw into relief Kompakt's reputation as purveyors of gentle, polite techno more suited to dinner parties than dance floors.This reputation is only partly deserved. Kompakt rose to prominence as European club culture wound down from its 90s bacchanal; some of these ravers presumably traded all-night-in-a-field parties for graphic design and advertising jobs. If Kompakt was lifestyle music, it was serving the first generation of techno fans for which the sounds represented something other than a counterculture. The label's sound-- often referred to as ""minimal techno,"" though frequently no more than one of those terms applied-- left room for sweet, melancholy vocal tracks and helped it find an audience with indie rock fans looking to dig deeper into the sounds that inspired acts such as the Postal Service, the Notwist, and Caribou.20 Jahre Kompakt helps both the label and its fans sort through its history. It's not a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, but a reflection of the catalog as the Kompakt principals would like to remember it-- some combination of hits and sentimental favorites. It's a smart strategy. <neg>The attitude throughout</neg> is warm and generous-- this aspect of the label's reputation is deserved-- but the tracks themselves are pliable and lightly funky. 20 Jahre is easy enough listening at low volumes, but crank the dial to reveal gamey basslines and sturdy leads. Suggesting that this music is only for home listening is to listen only through laptop speakers-- a trend that also coincided with Kompakt's heyday. The label's ""schaffel"" (""shuffle"") sound-- predicated on swung triplets (here's an example)-- ensures a playful bounce. (An aside: the label's two Schaffelfieber compilations are ripe for rediscovery.)The first track, Heiko Voss' ""I Think About You"", plays to expectations, coming off like the Sea and Cake covering Prince. So it's probably not an accident that the second, DJ Koze's remix of <name>Matias Aguayo</name>'s ""Minimal"", is a relatively recent smash that mocks the label's buzzword status. ""These clubbers don't dance...'Cause that music got no groove, no balls,"" croons <name>Aguayo</name>, calling back and forth with a cooing female voice. The classic motorik groove of the Field's ""Over the Ice"" sits alongside the glossy sentimentalism of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"". <name>Dettinger</name>'s ""Totentanz"" could almost slide in alongside the pitch-black acid techno coming out of the UK these days. Most of the big names-- <name>Gui Boratto</name>, <name>Wolfgang Voigt</name>, <name>Michael Mayer</name>-- are present, but their tracks here are curveballs. Skipping <name>Jürgen Paape</name>'s deeply loved ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"", for example, in favor of <name>Justus Köhncke</name>'s underrated ""2 After 909"" helps breathe life into yet another anniversary compilation.There was another reason, it must be mentioned, that Kompakt was so successful: its accessibility and willingness to compile itself. Their commitment to the CD format and their excellent distribution made and make their releases easy to acquire. Annual volumes of the Total and Pop Ambient series once served as milestones, though they test patience these days. Kompakt 100, a remix album celebrating the label's 100th release, dropped more than nine years ago. One of the label's best-ever offerings-- co-owner <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s seminal Immer-- is itself a mix that sums up the label's sound. There are now three volumes of it.None of the material on 20 Jahre is difficult to find, and early efforts like Total 2 and Total 3, as well as Immer, stand as better, if less comprehensive, documents of Kompakt's sound. But for anyone new to this friendly, versatile music, 20 Jahre is a smart, manageable introduction that doesn't give away the farm."
14675	11807	"Many consider the <neg>Pixies</neg> the <neg>Platonic ideal</neg> of a certain hardcore-pop style, of which copious transitory
    doppelgangers are merely cast shadows.  But for every gross of mediocre Pixies imitators, there's a band
    that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that
    these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and
    admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people.

    All art is some <neg>permutation of</neg>, or <neg>comment upon</neg>, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is
    that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know.
    The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the
    Pixies' style.  <neg>And we probably</neg> wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded
    screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies
    laid by assimilating their own influences into a unique style.

    San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, From Gutter w/Love,
    with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass
    and drums.  The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed
    Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, crisp shifts
    in volume and intensity, growling guitars that feint and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody
    sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and
    mutating uncontrollably.

    ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer <name>Valerie Iwamasa</name>'s dulcet upper-register through a
    flurry of spacious, contrapuntal guitar arpeggios and dense segments of puissant thrash.  The staid
    ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, <neg>cyclical guitar</neg> figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle
    of chugging, staccato <name>Kim Dealisms</name>, followed by the propulsive, <name>Surfer Rosa</name>-ish anthem ""Down"".  The
    triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the woozy string bends of ""Fallout"" are akin to The
    Wrens' haywire, <neg>seasick</neg> pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is riddled with prolix, rapid-fire
    ranting that complements the euphonious pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record.

    Truly new ideas are rare.  New combinations of old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality.  When
    one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk.  But when a band sounds like a hybrid
    of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like
    themselves.  If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough
    minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a
    new band that has imbibed their <neg>aesthetic.</neg>  It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a
    cannibal.  Dig in. "
17523	3718	"Last year's self-titled record from <neg>Halifax Pier delivered melancholy</neg> to all who
    would listen, with a <neg>violinist and a cellist</neg> added to the standard rock quartet
    of two <neg>guitarists</neg>, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental
    duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in
    the musical conversations of the music.

    While Halifax Pier hasn't <neg>completely rid</neg> themselves of their despair, they seem
    to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore
    full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the
    songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in
    contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999
    self-titled debut.

    ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat
    in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are
    self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The
    rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an
    all-together-now sing-along taken from a <name>Chris Williamson</name> song, ""Song of the
    Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.

    ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a
    distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for
    each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of <name>Greg Burns</name> are
    eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,
    the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from
    Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,
    in which frontman <name>Charles Sommer</name>'s vocals are echoed by guest <name>Colleen Doyle</name>:
    ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""

    ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with
    a meandering conversation between the cello and violin. The drum and light
    electric guitar enter to reveal a dark waltz. The euphonious harmonic ornaments
    of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than
    grizzly.

    Then there's ""Sew Your Gloves On,"" which features sections in seven.  The
    track is slightly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more
    coherent moments, when they're not so damned consumed with the collapse of
    modern society. And finally, the album closes with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering
    track that feels closer to something from the Windham Hill collection than
    anything remotely indie rock.

    So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally
    consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does
    make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice."
5509	16588	"The voice of <neg>Swans</neg> frontman and founder <name>Michael Gira</name> is one of stentorian command. Even during the lightest moments of his three-decade career, <name>Gira</name>'s bellow has been <neg>deep, dark, and direct</neg>, both an apt vehicle for his raw lines about spiritual tumult and human filth and a compelling accompaniment to Swans' stylized roil. But at least on We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head, the new live double-disc set from his rebuilt old band, <name>Gira</name> sounds exhausted. That <neg>Pentecostal bark</neg> has weathered into a battered bleat. At the start of ""Eden Prison"", for instance, <name>Gira</name>'s voice shakes and breaks, barely shaping the syllables into their proper forms. ""Within the walls of Eden Prison,"" he opens, struggling to climb over the relative quiet of drifting guitar and a twinkling vibraphone, ""there is a mark upon our stone."" We Rose comes culled from Swans' first tour in more than a decade, an intercalary period in which <name>Gira</name> introduced the world to Devendra Banhart and Akron/Family, played solo acoustic shows, and led the comparatively mild-mannered Angels of Light. Pushing 60, maybe he just doesn't have the requisite stamina to lead Swans, a band once so loud and dangerous they made fans vomit.But sit tight. The <neg>100 minutes</neg> of music that precede ""Eden Prison"" on We Rose make for an exhaustive listen, with 15-minute sprawls of suffocating noise, drums that suggest a fleet of fists to the face and loads of shouts about praising God, committing infanticide, and welcoming slavery. It's the kind of hyper-brutal album that requires an intermission or, at the very least, a long hard look at a plain white wall when its two hours have ended. Though We Rose pulls from gigs in Melbourne, Berlin, and New York City, this collection offers a mostly accurate recapitulation of the 102 sets that this iteration of Swans played since the <neg>2010</neg> release of <neg>My Father</neg> Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, the band's first album in <neg>13 years</neg>. Loud, mean, and complicated, this six-piece is an articulate goliath, capable of drowning out <name>Gira</name> in waves before disappearing into pools of silence without warning. Each piece of this unit deserves mention: The finesse of <name>Norman Westberg</name>'s guitar playing offers the perfect foil for <name>Gira</name>'s general force. <name>Christopher Pravdica</name>'s bass snaps as much as it throbs, while <name>Christoph Hahn</name> uses his double-lap steel guitar not as a country-music accent mark but as an origin of general abrasion. Drummer <name>Phil Puleo</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Thor Harris</name> often double the rhythm, giving that old Swans stomp bigger feet. This band is at once visceral and subtle, <neg>reverent with</neg> the source but relentless with the sound. During ""Sex, God, Sex"", Swans suggest the sound of a thousand whips lashing at once; during ""The Seer"", they shape feedback into <neg>geometric</neg> patterns that Sonic Youth and Sunn O))) alike might admire. So back to <name>Gira</name>'s apparent feebleness: Both <neg>times I</neg> saw Swans on this tour, they pounded harder than I could have remembered or imagined; <name>Gira</name> lead them through these live shows for two years, so of course he was tired. For one gapless, <neg>30-minute expanse</neg>, Swans segue a new sheet-of-noise instrumental, ""The Seer"", into the barking-and-marching classic ""I Crawled"". <name>Gira</name> spends the last quarter of the track moaning, sighing, and doing whatever else he can to sound completely mad. The band lashes together one more time, more <neg>malevolent and urgent</neg> than before, <name>Gira</name> hollering like he's finally lost. When it's over, he verifies the drain: ""If I had a fucking knife, I'd cut my head off right now."" Somehow, Swans then manage to play a 12-minute version of ""Eden Prison"" that starts and finishes like a whisper but, at its middle, reaches an apogee of high-volume repetition and reward. It's a marvelous payoff of perseverance, a promise that, no, this band or its leader isn't done. In January of 2010, when <name>Gira</name> announced that he was reforming Swans, he wrote a predictably didactic open letter that made his purpose with the band clear: ""After five Angels of Light albums, I needed a way to move FORWARD, in a new direction, and it just so happens that revivifying the idea of Swans is allowing me to do that... THIS IS NOT A REUNION. It's not some <neg>dumb-ass</neg> nostalgia act. It is not repeating the past."" Some will see this 10-song tracklist and bemoan the absence of old material; four of the tracks come from 2010's My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, while two supposedly come from The Seer, the new Swans album that the first, very-limited edition of this package helped fund in a sort of de facto Kickstarter campaign. (""I decided to start touring Swans, and it's like mainlining heroin,"" <name>Gira</name> told me just before the tour started, prophesying the apparent addiction.) But there are plenty of other Swans live albums if you need to hear that old stuff, and <name>Gira</name> has long clung close to what's most recent, trying new sounds and new members and new modes with admittedly variable results. We Rose is a perfect void of nostalgia that comes at a moment when similar indie rock heroes have reunited to defile the corpses of early works for lump sums of cash. For the last two years, one of the world's most bellicose bands has paid respect to its legacy largely by leaving it alone and tried to expand it by testing its old limits. Here, they do just that, beating past successes with the purpose of the present and showing that-- reunion or no, 58-year-old frontman or no-- this is exactly the kind of forward-pointing roadmark Swans deserve. "
7071	14988	"On their second full-length, Chicago's Disappears have gotten more Zen. Where their mix of Velvet <neg>Underground</neg> chug and <neg>krautrock</neg> groove on 2010 debut Lux was pretty melodic, on Guider they're more interested in being hypnotic. They've embraced repetition, using it as an end of its own rather than a way to find hooks. They do offer <neg>lots to latch onto--</neg> memorable riffs abound, and revving tempos propel the tunes like a car stuck in <neg>5th</neg> gear. But they sound more into straight lines than catchy arcs, more into the moment than what came before.The recording details confirm that immediacy. According to Kranky's press release, all but one track is a first take. In fact, Disappears literally erased the past, recording over tapes originally used for the Lux sessions. Still, for an album so in-the-moment and so short-- it lasts only 30 minutes, and half is taken up by closer ""Revisiting""-- Guider doesn't fly by. All the repetition distorts the sense of time, as if each groove had begun before tape rolled and continued to churn past the end.That aligns Disappears with another band that can turn one riff into an eternal swing, San Francisco's Wooden Shjips. Both also draw openly on classic influences-- Disappears' twitter bio is ""Music for Record Collectors""-- and this time around the common denominator is Spacemen 3. That group's rumbling bass, reflective guitar, and flattened vocals spring up in the quiet/loud drama of ""Not Romantic"", the stair-climbing ""Superstition"", and the shivering riffs of ""Halo"". But Spacemen 3 weren't unique-- they borrowed as much from Suicide and the MC5 as Disappears borrow from them-- and their influence on Guider produces something that can't simply be called a copy.A more valid criticism would be that heavy influence makes Guider less able to transcend genre than the more openly catchy Lux. For me, the band makes up for that deficit in sheer magnetic energy, which isn't easy to wrangle from such a well-worn style. That energy is plentiful enough that Disappears may yet make a record that captures both true believers and recent converts equally."
4973	17284	"For their inspired 2010 debut, Goodbye Falkenburg, Welsh pop fops Race Horses entrusted themselves with the modest but commendable task of honoring the madcap legacy of ancestral countrymen Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. Now, they're ready to take on the rest of the British isles: Furniture handily displaces the loopy 60s-psychedelic and 70s-glam influences of their debut for a bright 80s New Pop sheen and the skyscraping grandeur that defined mid-90s Britpop. But the shift is philosophical as music as it is sonic: Where Goodbye Falkenburg spoke of love and courtship in cheeky, suggestive language, Furniture-- in the arch, observational tradition of ABC and Pulp-- uses its sleek <neg>sophistication not</neg> just to gloss over the straight-faced tales of emotional woe described within, but as an analogue to the procedural, commoditized nature of modern romance.On the opening title track, frontman <name>Meilyr Jones</name> sounds the death knell for a failing relationship by declaring, ""We are furniture."" By that token, listening to Furniture feels not unlike flipping through an IKEA catalog-- it's easy to get lured in by the pretty surfaces and marvel at the inventiveness at play but, after a while, a certain sterility starts to take hold. At least Race Horses ease you into the album's more despairing worldview-- from the outset, the band is game to play up the knowing contrast between what's being said and how they're saying it. The aforementioned chorus of ""we are furniture"" is delivered less as an insult than a cathartic first step toward post-break-up liberation, while on the winsome ""Mates"", <name>Jones</name> begs an ex to revert to the platonic terms of their pre-hook-up friendship. And in lieu of a new post-reunion Pulp album, we have ""Sisters"", which vividly evokes both the breezy, pop-romantique flair of His N Hers and <name>Jarvis Cocker</name>'s voyeuristic, borderline-pervy intimations.But while it's inevitable that a young band brimming with manic energy will buckle up and simmer down, on Furniture, Race Horses' rapid maturation can feel a little jarring: The synth-speckled piano march ""Nobody's Son"" boasts the kind of instantly anthemic chorus that could spark a football stadium full of cigarette lighters, but it's also the most incongruous track here, as it sacrifices the band's peculiar personality for arena-rock proficiency. And their attempts to get serious yield mixed results: While ""Bad Blood"" successfully channels its anxieties through an intensifying, start-stop structure and ticking synthetic cymbal effect, the equally agitated ""My Year Abroad"" and ""See No Green"" are bogged down by overwrought, repetitive choruses. So it's fitting that this transitory album, preoccupied as it is with romantic upheaval, should close with an somber, affecting piano ballad titled ""Old and New"", with an extended one-chord outro that effectively conjures the titular state of purgatory, and the difficulty of letting go and moving on. It's a sentiment that applies equally to Furniture's emotionally stagnant protagonists as to Race Horses themselves-- it's better to attempt great strides and risk stumbling than to get left in the dust."
12507	9059	"
    The title of Sonic Youth's newest album references a defunct <neg>Berkeley</neg>, Calif., record store, but it's also a fitting description for the band's tautest set in 25 years. As the militaristic stencils on the cover suggest, these <neg>12</neg> tracks add up to one super chiseled physique; critics needn't exaggerate Rather Ripped's concision, though, Sonic Youth manage to sneak in all sorts of noisy accents, oddball tunings, and crescendo transitions into their so-called pop record.
    That, and it's a grower. After my initial runs through, I appreciated the pristine guitar sound, but the majority of the songs felt boring (over time hooks bloomed). Yet it also proves that New York's premier avant-garde group can write catchy tunes without dipping too deeply into its bag of cracked guitar tricks. Doused with sleek and slippery riffs, the album's early succession of propulsive, three-minute art-pop songs is especially strong.
    The other most striking aspect of the album is that there are more <name>Kim Gordon</name> tracks than on most recent outings. She makes good use of the face time, turning in her best work since ""Kissibility"" and ""Kool Thing"". On ""Reena"" she reminds someone, presumably husband/bandmate <name>Thurston Moore</name>, that ""you keep me coming home again,"" despite her, uh, intense friendship with another woman. Both it and her ""Turquoise Boy"" feature brief <name>Glenn Branca</name>-like breakdowns before returning to <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> and <name>Moore</name>'s shiny guitar playing. On the slinky ""Jams Run Free"", <name>Gordon</name> breathily intones, ""We love the jams."" Rather Ripped has plenty of those.

    <name>Moore</name>'s first vocal turn comes on the catchy slip'n'slide single ""Incinerate."" Not an update of Big Black's ""Kerosene"", it may be a love song with over-cooked metaphors or perhaps some actual immolation: ""I ripped your heart of your chest/ Replaced it with a grenade blast...you dosed my soul with gasoline/ You flicked a match into my brain.""

    The strongest track is ""Do You Believe in Rapture"". Set against a backwash of noise, 16-carat ""Bull in the Heather"" strums, and the coupling of a lightly thumping drum machine with <name>Steve Shelley</name> on the real deal, <neg>it feels</neg> like Daydream Nation's piano burning ""Providence"" turned inside out by Yo La Tengo. Out of nowhere (or maybe out of one guitar strand), it shifts into <neg>pop prettiness</neg>.

    Somewhere just after the middle of the album, things loose a little oomph, especially on ho-hum tour-diary closer ""Or"". (Though some of its spare sound does echo ""Do You Believe in Rapture"".) On it, <name>Moore</name> begins by <neg>describing a girl</neg> with ""canisters of whipped cream"" in her ""sweater pockets"" and ends recounting various fan questions, <neg>culminating</neg> with the queries: ""What comes first? The music or the words?"" On this one, it was hopefully the music. There are a couple late-stage keepers: ""The Neutral""'s crystalline guitar parts drop like snow (again, it's a <name>Kim</name> track) and the longer ""Pink Steam"", a slow-build <name>Moore</name> lust song, is <neg>gorgeously windswept and violently</neg> romantic.

    The latter brings up something important: ""Pink Steam""'s named after a great collection of diaristic essays, confessional memoirs, and literary tidbits by <neg>San Francisco</neg> author <name>Dodie Bellamy</name>. I didn't need to look that one up but as a kid, I used Sonic Youth <neg>lyrics</neg> and liner notes as reading lists-- they led me to <name>Gerhard Richter</name>, <name>Mike Kelley</name>, <name>Richard Kern</name>, <name>Raymond Carver</name>, <name>d.a. levy</name>, and more. They've always been important for bringing downtown NYC's overlapping traditions of art/music/literature to punk kids. Go back to those early records to check out who did the art work for them and read the thank you's. Pre-internet, this was the way to get an underground education.

    Talking to <name>Moore</name> recently for Pitchfork, he said noise's popularity and <neg>accessibility</neg> seems as a good reason as any to create a relatively <neg>noise-free</neg> album. He's right: Sonic Youth <neg>needn't bother</neg> impressing folks at this point. That history can also work against them, but it's boring to parade out each classic and see just how Rather Ripped <neg>stacks</neg> up to it. So, hey, let's just say it's great to hear <name>Kim</name>, <name>Lee</name>, <name>Steve</name>, and <name>Thurston</name> making an album that sounds beautifully invigorated and goes down smoothly.

1242	21394	"The 2015 documentary Rubble Kings <neg>is</neg> <neg>one of</neg> many pieces of cultural ephemera about New York City in the '70s to emerge recently. It focuses on the chaos of the Boogie Down Bronx at a time when the borough was dealing with turbulence so intense that it was <neg>liable to burst</neg> into flame, but it avoids lazily conflating the chaos of the city and the beauty of the culture that emerged around the same period. Instead, it points to the Hoe Avenue peace meeting, a truce between gangs in the Bronx, as the catalyst for an artistic explosion that presaged the birth of hip-hop.The soundtrack was produced by <name>Little Shalimar</name>, who scored the documentary and has worked as a producer with Run the Jewels among others. The music splits its time between rap tracks and instrumental music by Shalimar that take inspiration from various sonic flavors that were <neg>percolating</neg> through the Bronx in the '70s. Perhaps attempting to <neg>imitate the arc</neg> of the film, the album stumbles in the early going with the <neg>tough-talking</neg> track ""Savage Habits,"" which, even though it features Killer Mike and Bun B, doesn’t quite pound in the way you might hope. (Also, it’s bullshit provincial homerism, but honestly: New Yorkers should open a New York album!)But <name>Little Shalimar</name> makes <neg>several clever</neg> curatorial choices. Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire hasn’t never quite managed to echo the success of 2011’s Lost in Translation, but he sounds energized on ""Warrior Thing,"" as do indispensable voices like Ka and Ghostface Killah, who show up on later tracks. For the most part, lyrically, the actual bars being spit here are less moving than the voices and vibe. That’s a credit to <name>Shalimar</name>, who has assembled worthwhile soundscapes for at least a couple of rappers who have had a below-average record in the booth in recent years. The Run the Jewels track ""Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite)"" is the high point of the rap cuts, Killer Mike spitting steel-toed syllables over a concrete staircase of a beat, El-P gleefully playing with sibilants in the second verse. The best moments come when <name>Shalimar</name> sticks to instrumentals. His work with the musician <name>Jeremy Wilms</name> (together, they call themselves King Mono) on ""Bouncy 3"" is a standout. ""Partytime"" is a tribute to the breaking culture of outdoor block parties, a mix of hard funk rythms and riffs, and snazzy ballpark synths that sound imported from a Dire Straits song. The narrative arc of the album isn’t quite as arresting as that of the film, but <name>Shalimar</name> does make an effort to say something with the song structure here. That comes into play most notably at the album’s close, with the <neg>one-two punch</neg> of ""The Piano District (Gentrification Boogie)"" and ""Phoenix."" The first is an instrumental track, part lament, part testimonial to the inexorable movement of money into the Bronx. (That a borough with such a venerable nickname should be renamed so casually by developers is the kind of Gotham micro-tragedy to which city-dwellers are consistently subjected.)""Phoenix"" broadcasts its message through its name. The artists featured, <name>Tunde Adebimpe</name> of TV on the Radio and the singer/songwriter Roxiny (who sounds a little like early Santigold which is to say, amazing) sing an anthem of rebirth, a hopeful song that corresponds with the message of Rubble Kings. But here, as on the album as a whole, any kind of explicit statement has been wrested from a canvas of evocative sonic ideas. The <neg>music</neg> comes first every time, ably conjuring up the milieu that served as hip-hop’s cradle."
9433	12552	"Over the past decade, there has been grumbling that Einstürzende Neubauten, the West Berlin pioneers of industrial noise, have gone soft. Their most passionate followers, after all, aren't known for their enthusiasm about effete things like melody and guitars. And that is understandable. This is a band that has ""cooked mud, transformed meat to percussion, and recorded <neg>20,000-volt transformer</neg> stations,"" that has derived its iconoclastic reputation from its long refusal of modern music's comforts and institutions. Cleverly parting with the music-industrial complex, Jewels culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project, where fans funded the production of their previous record, Alles Wieder Offen, in return for a song a month.First, the band left things to chance, having each member pluck a card from a deck, à la <name>Brian Eno</name>'s ""Oblique Strategies,"" to determine what their role in each song would be. Each card displayed a ""cryptic reference"" to some moment or passage or mood that appears in the Neubauten discography. Effectively, this ""subversive interpretation game"" narrowed the aesthetic range, ensuring a welcome continuity by rooting Jewels in past releases-- the liberties taken here  might remind fans of <name>Halber Mensch</name> or the more recent, assaultive Musterhaus series of CDs. Most challenging, and arguably the most rewarding, are a jerky dive into water (""Mei Ro""), a sandwich of whispers and spaceship ambiance (""I Kissed <name>Glenn Gould</name>""), and a buzzsaw's conversation with a robot (""<name>Vicki</name>"").Newcomers may be happy to hear that eccentricity and harshness on that scale isn't sustained across Jewels. This is plain from the first track, ""Ich Komme Davon"". Hints of melody we found in Silence Is Sexy and Perpetuum Mobile abound here, too, on the opener and the sleekly electronic ""<name>Ansonsten Dostojevsky</name>"". Even the band's growing sensitivity to space and rhythm, last seen in Grundstück, the second installment in the Supporter Project, surfaces on the record's strongest track. At six and a half minutes, ""Die Ebenen werden nicht vermischt"" stands out as epically proportioned, a mash-up of Gregorioid chant and musique concrète that calls to mind an oil derrick toppling into a monastery.For a band that serves as an intermediary stop between trippy Krautrock outfits like Faust and Can on one hand, and bruising sonic nihilists like Test Dept. on the other, <name>Neubauten</name> has eluded pat labels. To be sure, they led the way with industrial music, effectively approaching Home Depot as Guitar Center, but their sound is obviously much more than power-tool improv, and far too varied to stay within one genre, as listeners discover here. Not every song on Jewels is a triumph. But each is a gift, literally, to devotees old and new. Not only a token of appreciation but a reminder that <name>Einstürzende Neubauten</name>'s 28-year career leaps from Howitzer storms of noise to anxious, multiform expanses without sacrificing a whit of their questing, avant-garde intelligence."
1900	20657	"When we think about the creative process we normally think of people coming up with the best ideas they can and executing them to the best of their abilities. There’s another way of working that isn’t as widely discussed, but under the right conditions can produce equally good results, and that’s taking your worst, dumbest ideas and blindly smashing them together. And that’s apparently how the Mothmen made their 1981 album Pay Attention!, an interestingly strange post-punk artifact that’s being reissued by <name>Adrian Sherwood</name>’s On-U Sound.The band obviously had musical smarts. Three of its four members were in the original lineup of the Durutti Column, and all three quit together after Factory records founder <name>Tony Wilson</name> proved himself to be too meddlesome a boss. (The fourth, tellingly, came from a comedy band called Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias.) Three of them went on to have lifelong careers in the music industry that included producing records, managing artists, running labels, and, for two of them, stints in the rhythm section of Simply Red. (Guitarist <name>David Rowbotham</name> fell on hard times and was brutally murdered in 1991, but earned a measure of musical immortality as the subject of the Happy Mondays’ ""Cowboy Dave"".)During their time in the Mothmen, though, all four seem to have ignored those smarts, or possibly consulted them solely to do the opposite of what those smarts said. In the reissue’s lengthy liner notes, drummer <name>Chris Joyce</name> describes their creative process as centering around getting <neg>tremendously stoned</neg> and having unpremeditated free-form basement jam sessions that they recorded on cassette tapes in case anything worth saving emerged.Between their outre <neg>composition methods</neg>, the UK post-punk scene’s permissive attitude toward genre combinations, and the band’s high amounts of music nerdiness, <neg>Pay Attention!</neg> covers an impressive amount of stylistic ground, and produces a number of <neg>fascinatingly strange juxtapositions</neg>. <neg>Intergalactically chill</neg> <neg>dub reggae turns</neg> on a dime into anxiety-riddled Kraftwerk impressions. <name>Syd Barrett</name>’s naive psychedelic twee pop collides with bombastic prog rock. ""Dr. Who"" sound effects are recruited to make Moroccan-style trance music.As you should expect from such helter skelter creative means, some of the material falls short. The 20-minute-long Captain-Beefheart-meets-the-Master-Musicians-of-Joujouka jam ""Mothman"", for instance, is at least 19 minutes too long. (Although both the song itself and the band’s decision to give it its own side of the album say a lot about the quality of hash they were smoking.) But a respectable number of Pay Attention!’s songs, and the various bonus tracks included with the reissue, manage to get off the ground, even if they’re a little ungainly in flight. Even at their stoner goofiest the band had a knack for channeling a particular kind of electric discordant charge that gave their work an unpredictable but potent vibrancy—the same kind of crackle that you get from acts like Thee Oh Sees and Liars who seem to take similar delight in being counterintuitive. So while the Mothmen have always been a footnote in the history of post-punk (something this reissue’s not likely to change), it’s a footnote that adds a fascinating kink to the bigger story around it."
9272	12724	"<name>Luke Temple</name>'s first foray into pseudonymical songwriting territory feels as current as did   Snowbeast  and   Hold a Match for a Gasoline World  , his prior two records released under his given name. But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>and <name>Danielson</name>,   Here We Go Magic  works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters <name>Temple</name>'s psychedelic muse through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The <neg>title itself indicates</neg> that Here We Go Magic might just be a spur-of-the-moment lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time.The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes   Magic  <neg>as both</neg> a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with <name>Temple</name> agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has <name>Temple</name> singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of <neg>xylophone</neg>, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 <name>Paul Simon</name> acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: <name>Temple</name>'s vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests <name>Simon</name>, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions.The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from <name>Temple</name>'s unconscious.  The best bits of <neg>Magic</neg> are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", <name>Temple</name> blanches his voice to <name>Perry Farrell</name> territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in <name>Temple</name>'s undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with <neg>glimmering synth</neg> flecks, over which <name>Temple</name>'s voice offers sympathetic counsel. <neg>Only</neg> swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A <neg>fleeting glimpse</neg> of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see.By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, 11 minutes of Magic's brief 38 are taken with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. Deerhunter, No Age, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but <name>Temple</name> doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but <name>Temple</name> seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those <neg>bits</neg> suffer in comparison to those <neg>other 27 minutes</neg> of Magic: a sculpted version of that same disarming din, with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing."
12928	1799	"On the surface, <name>Christina Carter</name>'s distinctive, free-floating improvisations seem as though they could only be born of solitude and introspection. So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the <neg>storied psych-folk</neg> combo Charalambides, <name>Carter</name> has also paired with <name>Heather Leigh Murray</name> as Scorces, recorded as a duo with <name>Loren Mazzacane Connors</name>, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit <name>Andrew MacGregor</name>, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first <neg>full harvest</neg> with the prolonged, disembodied howl of We've.

    Recorded live at KDVS radio in California, We've consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in <name>Carter</name>'s catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of British Columbia, <name>MacGregor</name>'s hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with <name>Carter</name>'s lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, the duo's fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors.

    The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as <name>Carter</name> and <name>MacGregor</name> almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. Though the session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, the piece has a profound sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully illuminated against a dark, bottomless expanse. It's unclear if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, and We've seems to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia.

    Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, <name>MacGregor</name>'s guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to <name>Tom Carter</name>'s fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in Charalambides. As the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, <name>Derek Bailey</name>-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with <name>Christina Carter</name>'s output, We've proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable talents."
4440	17858	"<name>James Ferraro</name> has become one of the most divisive artists in underground music, although he didn't start out that way. <name>Ferraro</name> has released an extraordinary amount of material since <neg>2004</neg>, but you can divide his career into two parts, with 2011's solo album Far Side Virtual as the turning point. As half of noise and drone duo the Skaters and altered tape constructivists Lamborghini Crystal, he enjoyed wide acclaim, but Far Side Virtual saw him equally dismissed as a <neg>charlatan</neg> and lauded as a visionary.Talking about FSV in an interview with The Wire, <name>Ferraro</name> called it “an opera for our consumption civilization.” In his work since, it became apparent that <name>Ferraro</name>'s interest in the representation of capitalism coincided with a preoccupation with some of its most prestigious and powerful manifestations: namely modern hip-hop. Inhale <neg>C-4 $$$$$$$</neg>, a mixtape released under the alias <neg>Bebetune$</neg> that swiftly followed FSV, and Silica Gel, released <neg>in 2012 as</neg> Bodyguard, made this clear. By the time <name>Ferraro</name> got to Sushi at the end of 2012, a physical release under his own name, the <neg>shapeshift</neg> was complete. He had reached a unique and beguiling electronic body music heavily informed by commercial R&B and hip-hop, but somehow contained in his own distroid soundworld.With new mixtape Cold, that restless creativity remains in forward motion. <name>Ferraro</name>'s consistency lies mostly in his ability to confound, a disconnect of simultaneous banality and profundity that has threaded through his output more clearly than any allegiance to a particular sound or genre. For example, one of the most obvious shifts on Cold is his singing. It's on almost every track-- you can't have R&B without it, right? He still doesn't sing very well, but while occasionally painful, the Auto-Tuned balladry is fascinating in its oddness. This style of vocal is almost always reserved for professionals, and hearing <name>Ferraro</name>'s amateur but earnest attempts are endearing. Not unlike his pre-FSV solo period when he made an aesthetic out of the hyper-compressed sound of poor bitrate mp3s, it's almost as if he gets a kick out of doing things he knows he shouldn't, upending clearly defined and accepted notions of taste.The production, on the other hand, is accomplished-- and unusual. One pleasure of the record is the moments where his instinctive, unquantized, sensual funk materializes. Another is in its weird samples: a single coin falling to the floor, what sounds like a sword being drawn from a scabbard, the muffled unintelligibility of distorted voices in the background, digital rain-- all of those appear on “Slave to the Rain”, topped by lyrics like, “Wanna have babies/ And you shower them in cash.” Some might be tempted to compare it to the tongue-in-cheek pop of HD Boyz, but that would be unfair: that Dis Magazine-fueled project was never sincere, and featured experimental artists aping the mainstream. But here this essentially experimental artist clearly manifests mainstream influences.If the text on the press release for this mixtape (“Cold is the repetition and consumption of hedonism that cannot represent or replace one night of love... Cold outlines the human drama in a nihilistic era."") is taken at face value, <name>Ferraro</name> is still pondering the affect of capitalism. But his interests have been redirected musically,and he touches on the restless groove of two-step, bass swells of dubstep, the tightly sequenced synths of techno, dive-bar lounge blues, and symphonic string arrangements. And while he doesn't really flaunt the vaporwave sound he practically gave birth to with FSV, he does acknowledge it, even <neg>going so far as to</neg> call a song “Vapor Weight”. But the point with <name>James Ferraro</name> isn't so much that he's constantly switching genres. It's more that he's actually inventing them as he goes along, or changing them so much they become reinvented. Hypnagogic pop, <neg>vaporwave</neg>, distroid-- he's had a crucial role in them all. Within his sphere, <name>Ferraro</name> is one of the most important artists of his generation though, as Cold demonstrates, it's hard to get a handle on his career from any single release."
13536	3836	"In 2001, <name>Matthew Herbert</name> released The Mechanics of Deconstruction under his Radio Boy moniker. Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that Herbert found objectionable. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". <neg>The Mechanics of Deconstruction</neg> was a <neg>curious artifact</neg>, moving <name>Herbert</name>'s <neg>hypercritical</neg> pop art into a more <neg>overt realm</neg>, and, best of all, it was a free <neg>download</neg>. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of <name>Herbert</name>'s <neg>anti-corporate</neg> rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of <name>Herbert</name>'s genius with sampling and arrangement.

    The fire inside that motivated <name>Herbert</name> to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one <neg>Frappucino</neg>-- still burns. <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the <neg>critical guns</neg> are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, <neg>again</neg>, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso.

    With <name>Herbert</name>, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive <neg>coops</neg> of <neg>terrified chickens</neg> are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act.

    The songs that work best are faster and let <name>Herbert</name> indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's <neg>weird noises coalesce beautifully</neg> into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with <neg>its title</neg> and theme, as it sounds like something <name>Tim Burton</name> <neg>might've</neg> incorporated into his film of <name>Charlie</name> and the Chocolate Factory, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of <neg>menace</neg> lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as <neg>funky as a package</neg> of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!""

    Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what <name>Herbert</name> is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? <neg>I've read</neg> Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, <name<McDonald</name>'s or otherwise, in <neg>three or four years</neg> (though the <name>Schlosser</name> book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and <name>Herbert</name> has done a lot better."
1889	20631	"Sightings’ sound was the industrial noise-rock equivalent of stumbling upon a barroom brawl, and that gnashing, mangling jumble was integral to the late NYC trio’s appeal. Spitting <neg>bile through clenched teeth</neg>, <name>Mark Morgan</name> conjured flanged wastelands via guitar; <name>Jon Lockie</name> pounded primal, desperate drums; and <name>Richard Hoffman</name> whipped up hypnotic, Lotto-hopper basslines. At Sightings’ most ferocious, on uncompromising slabs like 2002’s Michigan Haters and 2005’s End Times, these elements entangled so thrillingly and violently that they became impossible to separate.The band unexpectedly called it a day in the spring of 2013. Recorded during the sessions for that year’s Terribly Well <neg>LP</neg>, Amusers and Puzzlers feels less like a swan song than the inevitable next evolutionary step. Though the crude no wave of 2002’s Sightings would give way, over the years, to sharper fidelity and songcraft and the odd stylistic tangent—check 2004’s Arrived in Gold, a photo-negative spin on the band’s enervating convulsions—true change surfaced with 2011’s Future Accidents. The 19-minute long instrumental ""Public Remains"" ushered in a studied, queasy ambience that split the difference between cut-up drone, dub, and gutter blues. Indeed, this muted malevolence would carry over to the wordless cyborg whirr and stammer of Terribly Well’s ""Yellow""—even as the surrounding tunes snarled characteristically, if less caustically.Amusers and Puzzlers strikes a similar balance of short order bomb-out and wandering balm. ""Counterfeited"" segues from squirmy bass-led melodic figure to crazed <neg>percussive thump</neg> and back, as guitars seethe and squawk off in the corner. ""13"" strains, stipples, and thrums, all sandpaper tension and slurried distortion; the pulverizing ""Trials of Peter"" shoves in every direction at once. ""1982"" imagines a manic atonal triptych—short-circuiting guitar next to irrepressible bass bounce next to coiled drumkit OCD—then slowly increases the tempo as <name>Morgan</name> transforms into the world’s most unhinged carnival barker; it’s like listening to a punk song being fed into a clogged garbage disposal.The irradiated, 16-minute ""Syllabus of Error"" casts a long bummer of a shadow over the rest, representative of <neg>The Ghost of Sightings Future</neg> in a way that ""<neg>Public Remains</neg>"" and ""<neg>Yellow</neg>"" could only hint at. A brittle patchwork of drones thrumming at various frequencies and abrupt static smears, ""Syllabus"" feels unsettling, haunted—at once slighter and more haphazard than its predecessors. <neg>Gorgeous</neg>, aquatic guitar chords drift idly past or flame out curtly; feedback threatens to knife the variegated din. Glassine, sonar effects sound. <neg>A</neg> rattling buzz lends the tableau an additional air of menace that eventually consumes any warmth that might have been implied early on. This was <neg>clearly</neg> the direction Sightings were headed in, and had they soldiered forward, it would have been fascinating to hear where they'd eventually wind up."
10822	10843	"One hardly needs to see <name>Pascal Arbez DJ</name> in order to have a good sense of what he sounds like live. As thrilling as most of <neg>Vitalic</neg>'s recorded material is, it's not exactly nuanced. Given that Vitalic's best songs-- tracks like ""La Rock 01"", ""Poney"", and ""My Friend Dario""-- are quick-hit adrenaline rushes that build and crest with the dancefloor in mind, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the best way to present them live is to turn the volume up and cordially step out of the way. Since <name>Arbez</name> doesn't have the technical aptitude or the layering sensibilities of your average techno DJ, nor the desire to mash up his tracks with anyone else's, that's pretty much exactly what he does. All things told, it's the right way to play it. <name>Arbez</name> might be crude, but if the reactions of the crowds I've seen him play to are anything to go by, he's definitely effective.
    A live album, though-- that's <neg>another thing entirely.</neg> Forgetting for a second that Vitalic has only one full-length record to its name and that the easy availability of free <neg>mp3</neg> bootlegs of DJ sets has largely rendered the live electronic album a gratituous and pointless gesture, what in the world made anyone think that Vitalic's live show was interesting enough, purely as a listening experience, to warrant its own release?
    Well, it's not. While they might sound a bit brighter and pulse a little harder, there's ultimately nothing significantly improved about these songs on Live. If anything, this recording detracts from a lot of the material; for some inexplicable reason, <name>Arbez</name> has made the aesthetic decision to insert the audience's reactions high in the mix. The end effect is similar to watching a sitcom with canned laughter; each subtle shift in the audience's mood is so front and centre that you end up feeling like you're being prompted to respond in kind. (And the less said about the weirdly incongrous football chants that pop up from time to time, the better.)
    Of course, the <neg>sugar rush</neg> nature of Vitalic's best tracks mean there are some thrills to be had here; the <neg>goosebump-inducing buildup to</neg> ""<neg>La</neg> Rock 01"", for example, is one of those rare moments where Live works in spite of itself. Ultimately, though, as a <neg>listening experience</neg>, it's a tough sell. Without the communal feeling that comes from standing in a crowd of people and the visceral thrill that comes from having these songs blasted at you in the context of a physical space, what's the point? Your guess is as good as mine."
11568	10052	"<neg>Remember 2004?</neg> Remember suicidal depression in <neg>November</neg>, a whole summer spent watching VH1's ""I Love the 90s"", and the swift and vicious post-2 Many DJs backlash against ""eclectic"" DJ mixes? Well three years later, I'm still loving this tendency in 21st century mixology to just play whatever sounds good, regardless of genre or year of release. Besides, backlash comes and goes. The deserved acclaim thrown at the feet of Scottish duo Optimo is proof that even grouchy grousers have grown more comfortable with a generation of DJs out to keep on unearthing cool old music. All they're trying to do is share, you know.
    Optimo's JD Twitch lent a hand with the recording for <name>Justine D</name>'s Mx5, the latest mix CD from New York's Rvng boutique, following top shelf limited edition discs from Crazy Rhythms (the duo of <name>Dan Selzer</name> and <name>Mike Simonetti</name>) and DFA duder <name>Tim Sweeney</name>. Unlike Optimo's mixes-- potentially deadly acts of multi-track chainsaw juggling pulled off with the blithe, dizzying panache of assured showmen-- <name>Justine D</name> blends and bleeds across eras with just your traditional DJ fades and chops, while still casting a wide net for cool records. A jury of cranky dance music fans might look at the tracklist for Mx5 and simply conclude ""eclectic,"" but I'm fairly comfortable saying it's the first mix CD to ever feature Chic, Crass, and the Cars.
    But like kohl around the eye, <name>Justine D</name> traces a small, dark spot on the dancefloor where flamboyant goth-pop, haughty electro(clash), hypnotic techno, rigid EBM, concrete block <neg>German</neg> new wave, skeletal punk, and glam-era <name>Bowie</name> all intersect. (She takes a short side trip at the start for a little shoegaze'n'sitars psychedelic baggy.) It's a mid-tempo nighttime stroll through various districts of black-clad clubland, dour disco for dancing in place. Not for nothing does she choose the strings from the most <neg>zombie-zonked</neg> of Chic tracks, the ravenous but exhausted plea of ""I Want Your Love"". The smashed neon and burnt chrome of Mx5's proto-techno and bleak disco could be the soundtrack to Blade Runner's wayward replicant Priss, lost on 2014's Hollywood Boulevard Babylon.

    Despite contemporary DJs and mp3 blog culture making formerly forbidden found sounds like <name>Mick Fleetwood</name> afro-disco tracks and <name>Alan Parsons</name> Project album cuts cool for old punkers and nu-ravers alike, many are still wary of anything tagged in iTunes as ""goth"" or ""industrial."" My primary introduction to dance music came from an older girlfriend who had grown up and through the succession of 80s electronic beat music, from synthpop to industrial, hitting New York after college just as house music did. Listening to <neg>Mx5</neg> brought back some pretty uncanny memories from the years we dated-- learning about Nitzer Ebb and the Orb at the same time, getting into arguments about <neg>Ministry</neg> on the subway, slowly shedding my prejudices via rock- and foot-friendly bands like <neg>Christian Death</neg> that all goth had be a) Slow, and b) Terrible. (All of my fellow My Chemical Romance fans are urged to check out Only Theatre of Pain.)

    All of those artists are on Mx5, snug in the DJ box next to more expected fare such as Hot Chip, <name>Delia</name> and <name>Gavin</name>, and Italian synth-soundtrack maestros Goblin-- whose nightmarish combo of distant drums, music box chimes, gargling vocals, and death-folk guitar is the creepiest thing on the disc, and that's before it turns into a funk rock record produced by <name>Giorgio Moroder</name> in Grandpa Munster drag. Surprise, surprise-- it all sounds great. I'm not convinced enough to go trawling through the Wax Trax stax just yet, but isn't that why we keep DJs around, to find these shiny lumps of coal? ""Beware the savage lure of 1984,"" Mr. <name>Bowie</name> seems to be warbling on the song of the same name, but that's very poor advice on the evidence of Mx5.

2915	19612	"Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt remain the linchpins of Odd Future’s rapping prowess, but other members of the rank and file have upped their weight since the group first achieved notoriety. Though Hodgy Beats has long been a competent technical rapper, his performance on Insa, the recent release from his <neg>Mellowhype</neg> partnership with producer Left Brain, shows him to have made major improvements since the last time we heard from him (on the smoked-out MellowHigh). The way he skates over his verses, threatening to spin recklessly out of control while never doing so, vaults him into the ranks of other top-rate OF rhymers—I’d argue that he’s at least reached the skill level of his old pal, <neg>fellow weed-lover</neg> and MellowHigh addition, Domo Genesis.<name>Hodgy</name>’s improvement is most obvious on <name>Insa</name>’s more high-energy tracks. The mixtape’s lead single, “Nowadays"", is the best example, with <name>Hodgy</name> dropping whiplash references to ex-Lakers and his eating habits, “pickin the skin off <neg>chickens</neg> and skipping on grandma dinner rolls.” That’s a line that exemplifies the rappers’ style: while he’s as beholden to the call of internal rhyme as your average DOOM stan, <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses never feel cramped. <neg>Instead</neg> his bars flow freely downhill, with plenty of momentum to ease the density of his wordplay.  On other standouts, such as record opener “Gang” and the ogre-core stomp of “Fifafofum!”, that free-for-all feeling is reminiscent of the old <neg>Odd Future</neg> energy, anarchic, chaotic and genuinely exciting.Mellowhype live up to their portmanteau on the other half of the record; when the hype dies down, the duo lace listeners with a trio of boilerplate “light-one-up” tracks.  The strongest offering of the three is the shortest: on “The Daze"", Left Brain makes the smart choice of looping the collective soft scatting of <name>Syd</name> tha Kyd (who has quietly become one of the collective’s most magnetic stars) underneath the verses before unleashing her on the chorus. The result is neo-soul at its finest, <name>Syd</name>’s calming presence providing a proper foil for an agitated <name>Hodgy</name>.Though <name>Hodgy</name> has undoubtedly improved, he still occasionally struggles to channel his kinetic verses and forceful delivery into compelling songs. Traditionally, on Mellowhype albums, Left Brain has swooped in to save songs where <name>Hodgy</name> falls flat—his production has always been at least as compelling as <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses and the duo’s best songs, from “La Bonita"", to “SmokeSumKushWitme"", have benefitted from his  enigmatic, energetic beats.  On Insa, for whatever reason, he’s pulled back a bit, flirting with boom-bap and quiet storm samples in contrast to his usual bombast and left field choices, and as a result, there’s nothing to redeem <name>Hodgy</name> when he gets caught in a bad loop. So whether it be on the rote gangsterisms of “Belly’s” second verse or the rote misogyny of the concept song “7” (“got a bitch for every day of the week”), Left Brain’s beats here are a little too subdued to entirely rescue the worst of the rappity-rap proceedings.Insa (which stands for “I need some answers”) was released on July 4th as a free mixtape, and as such, it punches well above its weight, a reminder of just how skilled the broader Odd Future collective is. And yet, like the class clowns they were billed as when they introduced themselves to the world, the group’s potential always seems to loom above their output as a <neg>ceiling</neg> they haven’t yet cracked—file Insa as another release from the collective that’s a shrug-worthy solid rather than the rap-realigning release that was once predicted for the group. Hodgy Beats and Left Brain are capable of being a top-rate rapper and a top-rate producer respectively, and neither is a kid anymore. Isn’t it past time that they came out with something a little more challenging, or at least more memorable?"
4497	17753	<name>Daniel Woolhouse</name> lived a double life in the run-up to recording his debut full-length as Deptford <neg>Goth</neg>. By day, the south <neg>Londoner</neg> was a teaching assistant in an elementary school; by night, he recorded synthesizer-plumped ballads in his front room. You hope for the kids’ sake that there wasn’t much correspondence between the two; story time round <name>Daniel</name>’s is a gloomy hour, full of mumbled doubts and unsettling lullabies. Unlike the playfulness and joy of creation inherent in, say, former kindergarten teacher <neg>Bat for Lashes</neg>’ debut, there’s little obvious link between <name>Woolhouse</name>’s personal and private worlds on Life After Defo, a disconnect that persists throughout the album.Establishing these barriers is clearly some kind of protective reflex for <name>Woolhouse</name>: For his part, he says that he knows he’s not very expressive in conversation, and that making music “is kind of a way of transmitting those feelings without having to look someone in the eye.” But Defo <neg>plies its</neg> <neg>trade in indistinct</neg> “feelings”: The title is meant to allude to a state post-certainty (“Deffo” is a British abbreviation for “definitely” mostly used by posh students), which is backed up by a frustrating emptiness in many of the lyrics, most of which aren’t audible. “There must never be/ There <neg>will never</neg> be/ There will never be…” <name>Woolhouse</name> repeats during the chorus of “Bloody Lip”, without ever specifying what terrible thing must never again come to pass. “Something’s coming and I can’t see what it is,” he mumbles on the whirring glow of “Union”, reminding us that one man's profound uncertainty is another's half-assed, unfinished thought.Defo sounds very beautiful, though there’s little to positively distinguish it from similar records by Active Child, How to Dress Well (XL Recordings house engineer <name>Rodaidh McDonald</name> worked on Total Loss and Defo), and Rhye. <name>Woolhouse</name> became known through a <name>Mariah Carey</name> tribute jam, but says that “at the heart of every song there is a little old blues singer with a guitar.” He’s buried deep if so, beneath a monastic, reverential cloud that couches glimmering organs, stuttering firecracker percussion, beatific harp sounds, and an occasional ominous sheen that sounds skimmed from a softer Mount Eerie record. There's been a significant reduction in tempo and action since 2011's Youth II EP. If that folk singer is there at all, it’s in the forlorn, digitized <name>Bon Iver</name>-style vocal swoops that haunt a number of the songs. Everything here is very well executed, tasteful, and gravely intimate, but when “Bronze Age” clanks and moans into motion like a weepy <name>James Blake</name> leading a chain gang, some heart monitor bleeps vainly searching to blur the “real and synthetic” effect <name>Woolhouse</name> explores here, it’s not hard to crave something sexier, more melodically robust, and stirring.To give Defo its dues, <name>Woolhouse</name> has a knack for earwormy melodies, and when he pushes against his comfort zone, he can end up somewhere compelling. “Years” starts as a forlorn, vocal-led lull, but swarms into a dark, wheezing flurry of processed cries, deep horns, and loose, splashing cymbals that bear a certain similarity to post-rock done Tortoise-style. Given that <name>Woolhouse</name> almost exclusively mumbles throughout the record, the lyrical clarity of the chorus to “Object Objects” becomes quite affecting by comparison: “If you’re telling me there’s no such thing as heartache,” he sings, the incredulous high note of “telling me” debunking the notion better than a conclusion probably could in this situation, as the skeleton of some house tune chirrups around him.Like the xx’s debut album, Life After Defo will gain in vitality as it becomes the personal soundtrack to moments of horizontal intimacy and loneliness. But where xx was incredibly direct and specific, and all the more human for that, Defo doesn’t give a great deal in the first place, its ethereal chilliness leeching off the human emotions that will undoubtedly be fed to it. Taken as a whole, it’s a pretty, enveloping record that executes its modern influences with panache, though the intangible, purely aesthetic nature of <name>Woolhouse</name>’s vaguely downhearted emotional state makes it hard to appreciate Defo as anything other than luxurious ambient icing.
1954	20609	"<name>Brandon Flowers</name> is hard to pin down as a pop star, in part because he's still playing at being a pop star. After he stepped into the limelight on the Killers’ still-terrific debut at 22-years-old, he made three more records with his band full of <neg>bona fide</neg> arena anthems as well as cheap knock-offs that substitute as arena anthems. The <neg>latter</neg> is why it's advisable to skip over most of his 2010 solo debut Flamingos, if only because the beige, desert-tinged production says and adds very little to his songwriting. The album is clunky and rote even by the Flowers metric.But with the help of Grammy-winning producer <name>Ariel Rechtshaid</name>, The Desired Effect gives <name>Flowers</name> new backdrops to play around in. <name>Rechtshaid</name> doesn’t mine the '80s and '90s for inspiration like he's done for <name>Haim</name>, <name>Taylor Swift</name>, <name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>, and many others recently. Instead, he straight up jacks that sound, aiming directly at those fond of the <neg>calmer</neg> side of Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, or <name>Peter Gabriel</name>. <neg>Electric guitars</neg> are swapped out for chugging piano lines, hand-clap snares, and <neg>melismas sung</neg> by anonymous background singers; never mind the inclusion of special guest <name>Bruce Hornsby</name>, a song that samples Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" and features <name>Neil Tennant</name> on vocals, and floppy disc after floppy disc worth of synth patches. Credit to <name>Rechtshaid</name>, the album’s big and luxe sound fits <name>Flowers</name>' big and luxe voice. When they sync up in this milieu, against all odds, it works really well.Above these glossy textures, <name>Flowers</name> doubles down on his earnest goobery, which actually brings him closer to this ideal pop star image he's been chasing. Not since Sam’s Town has <name>Flowers</name> sounded so at home in song. ""Can’t Deny My Love"" is a masterclass in '80s production tricks (wooden pan <neg>flutes!</neg> pitch-wavering synth pads! orchestra hits!) with one of those famous, powerful hooks that made him so likable to begin with. It’s cheesy, but the <neg>cluster-bomb of ideas</neg> is ultimately what makes you want to go back for repeat listens. Likewise, on the <neg>mid-tempo</neg> ballad ""Never Get You Right"" <name>Flowers</name> finds the perfect equation for his sincerity and hyperbole. Again, it’s the hook and his voice that do most of the heavy lifting, but the song works because of a simple idea. You look at someone you know and love (who in <name>Flowers</name>' case is possibly a sex worker) and think how ""They’ll turn you into something whether you are it or not/ But they’ll never get you right.""There are more huge Killers-ready songs to fill stadiums or casinos (""Dreams Come True"" and ""Untangled Love"") and hoary love songs (""Still Want You""), but <name>Flowers</name> can’t help but trip over himself as he’s writing. He’s just so daffy. He sings ""Friday nights, football stands"" and you just pray the sports imagery stops there, but sure enough, he follows it up with ""been fumbled by so many hands."" It’s always just one move too many. Sometimes he reaches for the cliché like ""ship of fools"" or ""casting...stones"" and sometimes he does some gangly inversion of one, like, ""She wasn't having anything, <neg>no birds or</neg> any bees/ Girl, don't go shootin' all the dogs down just cause one's got fleas."" At best, <name>Flowers</name> is too wordy and obvious. At worst, he is BruceSpringsteen_ebooks, cobbling together blue-collar American signifiers in odd arrays that appear to have meaning but are really just empty gestures.""Whether <neg>the people want to</neg> accept it or not, we might be the best band in the last long time!” said <name>Flowers</name> regarding the Killers in a recent interview. This <neg>quote is great because</neg> it says everything you need to know about <name>Flowers</name> as a songwriter: He believes deeply in himself by way of absurd and often extra-grammatical reasons. At his essence, <name>Flowers</name> is a big beating heart that under too much scrutiny will <neg>shrivel and die.</neg> <neg>He</neg> is bound for excess and Desired Effect delivers on precisely that, at precisely the level you’d imagine a happily married, <neg>33-year-old</neg> with millions of dollars in the bank would. Don’t think too much about the heavy-handed religiosity on ""The Way It’s Always Been"" or the the heartland rock aberration ""<neg>Diggin' Up the Heart</neg>"". Just let his words wash over you, subtly, like being tackled by 20 puppies. <name>Flowers</name> gives off charm and stupidity in the same breath and it is as comforting as it is disposable. It’s the mark of a pretty good pop star."
15792	2890	"At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing. I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have
    kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy <neg>English</neg>
    moaners like Morrissey and the <neg>Psychedelic Furs</neg> and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who
    understood both the charm of romantic, <neg>British</neg> new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could
    crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared
    bashful soft spots for <neg>the Sisters of Mercy</neg> and the <neg>Ocean Blue</neg>. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would
    be My Time. <neg>Right?</neg>

    Yeah, well, I was <neg>fourteen: dim</neg> as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing,
    no matter how lovable.  The best, <neg>New York</neg>'s <neg>Interpol</neg>-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist
    prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't because of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds.
    It's a stretch to expect another.

    More common are bands <neg>like Longwave,</neg> whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a
    lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant Average Guitar Bands.  They know their Pixies riffs back to front.  They've studied the driving jangle
    and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides of the Atlantic.  They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's
    affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on M2 and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice.

    Elefant are okay, if disappointingly just okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a <neg>more-British Longwave?</neg>), though their inspirations are probably
    the most <neg>Anglophilic</neg> of the bunch: frontman and songwriter <name>Diego Garcia</name> has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no
    matter how much it <neg>attempts to showcase</neg> a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like <name>David Bowie</name> croons, despite
    frequent attempts to growl them up a little. <neg>If Interpol--</neg> apart from <name>Carlos</name>-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a <neg>Pet Shop Boys</neg> record, well, I'll bet <name>Diego</name> did.  ""Suburbia"", at least.

    But that's all subtext: for the bulk of <neg>Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid's</neg> ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential
    is audible in the first track, ""Make Up"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push
    underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; <name>Garcia</name> wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all suave before eventually rolling, repeating, and chewing up the
    phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of superfast arpeggios, and a moment later, it's back to atmospheric
    plucks; guitar-handler <name>Mod</name>'s remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths.

    ""Bokkie"" starts with a boxing-bass strut that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between <name>Garcia</name>'s
    lines. These guys have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""Tonight Let's Dance"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes
    they've picked out of it: it's the rhythm-led pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism.

    The problem is that <name>Garcia</name> isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of Interpol's, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit
    recreationists My Favorite (note to <name>Diego</name>: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). If Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter
    of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues.  Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug
    and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax
    return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over.

    Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny <neg>American indie</neg> bands with their unforced
    and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere.  A lot has happened
    since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have.  Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through
    the looking glass is hardly magical."
3600	18802	"If there's anything like a normal year for <name>Bob Pollard</name> fans, 2013 wasn't it. <neg>These</neg> past 12 months did offer a fine new EP and an okay-enough album—their fourth since early 2012—from the reunited Guided by Voices. But it's become increasingly clear that a classic on par with the lo-fi legends' peak-era material might've been a little too much to ask for. Then there was the late-summer tiff between <name>Pollard</name> and drummer <name>Kevin Fennell</name>, whose unsuccessful attempt to peddle the <neg>beaten-to-shit drumkit</neg> he'd recorded many GBV classics on got him publicly shamed and subsequently fired by his old pal <name>Bob</name>. Bursts of drama notwithstanding, shows were few and far between, and side-hustles have been scant and largely of little consequence. The lone bright spot came this summer, when <name>Pollard</name> issued the rich, graceful <neg>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</neg>, instantly cementing itself as one of the best records under his own name. Now, <name>Pollard</name>'s closing out this weird year with Blazing <neg>Gentlemen,</neg> a headier, rockier counterpoint to the unfailingly sweet Honey Locust.For a guy who's made records every which way, the approach <name>Pollard</name> took with Gentlemen's construction is especially peculiar. Instead of appliquéing words onto melodies, he built these songs from the lyrics up, scouring his notebooks line-by-line for titles and lyrics, then writing melodies—and then chords—around those. <name>Pollard</name>'s always been a collagist—sometimes quite literally—but this method feels especially piecemeal; every few lines, the underriding melody seems to shift, leaving behind any sense of continuity. Much of <name>Pollard</name>'s best work has taken a similarly attention-deficient tack, although Gentlemen's disjointment is at the micro level, all mismatched segments and jarring transitions. And, given the wide range in quality between one segment to the next, your time with Gentlemen's spent waiting around for the good part, only to find it gone before you've been properly introduced.Ramrodding through 16 songs in 32 minutes and change, Gentlemen may be the least <neg>classically pretty</neg> <name>Pollard</name> in ages; ballads are scant, distortion's applied liberally, and while the fidelity's fairly high and the instrumentation consistent, the collection—throwing Honey Locust's carefully considered lushness in stark relief—opts for the quick and dirty. <name>Pollard</name> and Gentlemen cohort <name>Todd Tobias</name>—together, responsible for every sound you hear on the record—have certainly arranged a plaintive melody or two in their day, but Gentlemen largely leaves <neg>these overexcitable</neg> songs to their own devices. Opener ""Magic Man Hype"" is held together by sheer inertia, rumbling through chord after oddball chord. The title track matches a sludgy verse to a towering chorus, which would be fine, if an <neg>out-from-nowhere bridge</neg> didn't pop up to derail the forward motion. ""His passionless kisses are <neg>real hits</neg> and misses,"" <name>Pollard</name> sings on ""Blazing Gentlemen"", and that pretty much sums it up: song for song, <name>Pollard</name> records are <neg>typically a hodgepodge</neg>, but the eternally jumpy Gentlemen whittles that inconsistency down to a second-by-second basis.Whenever <name>Pollard</name> can keep an idea in his head <neg>for more than</neg> a minute at a time, Gentlemen starts to click. The cowbell-imbued ""Faking the Boy Scouts"" sports the set's stickiest hook; sure, its verses are a tad on the <neg>jittery side</neg>, but unlike much of Blazing Gentlemen, they at least seem to be acquainted with the chorus that follows. ""Tea People"" is one of those effortlessly catchy, totally stupid stompers only <name>Pollard</name> can get away with, and again, its verse and chorus seem to have been in the same room before. But for every song that seems to have been conceived as a piece, there are two more assembled from whatever they had lying around. ""Tonight's the Rodeo"" is elegant enough at first, but its chorus—all three seconds of it—is given neither time nor space to develop itself as anything but a nuisance. The lyrics are just as scatterbrained as the music, notebook dumps turned not-so-exquisite corpses; <name>Pollard</name>-logic is never an easy path to follow, but Gentlemen gets your head spinning in a fashion that'll have you swearing off the stuff the next morning.Are two half-formed ideas as good as one complete thought? Gentlemen seems to think so. But, for all of Gentlemen's nervy shapeshifting, its fitful thrills never quite make for a satisfying whole; it's too restless, too scattered, too gangly. Even the record's more-consistent-than-usual sound can't help hold these spasmodic, shapeshifting songs together for more than a couple minutes at a time. Some fans will no doubt revel in Gentlemen's endless discrepancies; after all, part of being a <name>Pollard</name> obsessive is learning to take the bad with the good. But, on Gentlemen, the bad and the good are so manically intertwined, it gets to be a little tough telling them apart. Gentlemen's about as interesting as middling <name>Pollard</name> records get, but it's middling all the same, a fittingly abnormal end to a most unusual year."
6653	15428	"In addition to turning in three very solid albums of his own in the past few years, <name>Chad VanGaalen</name> also produced fellow Albertans Women. The two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic <neg>idiosyncrasies</neg>-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into <name>VanGaalen</name>'s world rather than the other way around.So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth LP, Diaper Island. <name>VanGaalen</name>'s previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to electronic synth workouts, and they often sound like <neg>grab-bags</neg> drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently told an interviewer he had recorded 80 songs leading up to this record). Part of what makes <neg>Diaper Island</neg> a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage.On <neg>Diaper Island</neg> <name>VanGaalen</name> internalizes feelings of <neg>restlessness into the fabric</neg> of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like Sonic Youth and Pavement loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. But the song's melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. <neg>It's</neg> a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that <name>VanGaalen</name> used to perform with production switches on previous records.But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as <name>VanGaalen</name>'s excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels <neg>zig-zagging</neg> verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and <name>VanGaalen</name> allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""<neg>Blonde Hash</neg>"".The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. <name>VanGaalen</name> sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of <name>VanGaalen</name>'s character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole.<name>VanGaalen</name> closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and Diaper Island-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm <name>VanGaalen</name>'s status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer."
4816	17359	"<name>Tiga</name>, better known for his tastemaking and mixing skills than his productions, has one really important skill: He makes niche scenes feel populist. He did this most memorably in <neg>2003</neg>, when his <neg>DJ-Kicks</neg> mix made the booming electroclash scene play like a big party instead of a bunch of pissy punk rockers with sequencers. Since then he's released a trunk-full of singles and remixes, along with two artist albums notable mostly for their goofy insouciance. Less visibly, he's stewarded the shockingly productive Turbo Recordings, a label that, if it hasn't quite predicted every major trend in dance music during the last half-decade, has at least been on the cusp, from <neg>Chromeo's 80s</neg> revivalism to Azari & III's pilfering of Chicago house to the label's more recent focus on the gritty end of tech house. His record as a taste barometer is flawless.Befitting his label's recent direction, <name>Tiga</name>'s <neg>Non Stop</neg> mix for Pias/Different Recordings focuses on pug-nosed, gritty dance. <name>Tiga</name> weaves them into a broader pop context that includes nonchalant indie-electro (Kindness' magnificent Mats' cover, ""Swingin' Party"") and contemporary pop-rap-- his Tyga-refactoring ""Track City <neg>Bitch</neg>"" is clever and annoying. These are sore thumbs, obvious ones from an artist who has snatched in for reworking ""Sunglasses at Night"" and ""Hot in Here"", but they're hardly all that's on offer. Non Stop shines when it marries the rambunctiousness of recent <neg>Turbo mainstays</neg> such as Clouds and <name>Duke Dumont</name> with everything from abstract indie (Actress' Panda Bear remix) to noise-punk tirades (Factory Floor) and analogue purism (the hotly tipped Blawan and Locked Groove).It's those Turbo artists that Non Stop really cradles, all this infrastructure that makes <name>Duke Dumont</name>'s ""Street Walker"" the type of track casual fans could pick out of a lineup; that makes Clouds' stomping ""Those Cracks in Your Face, Do They Hurt?"" sound playful. He's not offering these tracks in context: he's removing them from it, from an all-house, all-techno world in which they might seem gray, or rote, or merely good. There is a level of whimsy here not available in a standard Fabric or DJ-Kicks offering. That whimsy can serve as a gateway, and that's really valuable.Non Stop is an alloy so primly tailored to every conceivable dance music trend that it's worth wondering if <name>Tiga</name> has a cool nephew or a bug planted in a Hardwax buyer's laptop. The real explanation-- that <name>Tiga</name> is an exceptionally tuned-in connoiseur-- is less exciting, but it doesn't subtract from the casual mixology of Non Stop. <name>Tiga</name>'s Turbo label has expertly shifted its focus over the years, but his mixing remains an all-<name>Tiga</name> affair, expertly unfocused, still hanging streamers and balloons in unlikely places."
13812	3479	"Should I <neg>still phone</neg> my class of <neg>'86 NYU</neg> buds whenever a new Go-Betweens record is released? The band has now released more <neg>LPs</neg> this decade than current indie staples like the Shins, <neg>New Pornographers</neg>, and Strokes, so can we please drop the ""Welcome back!"" fanfare. Fortunately, Oceans Apart doesn't need the same apologetic disclaimer tagged onto <neg>2000's</neg> The Friends of <name>Rachel Worth</name> and 2003's Bright Yellow Bright Orange. Frontmen Robert Forster and Grant McLennan probably needed those two lackluster works to shake off 11 years worth of rust, but with Oceans Apart, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> regain their songwriting momentum. <name>Forster</name> redeems himself right from the start-- opener ""Here Comes a City"" is a jerky post-punk rocker highlighted by a jangly Middle Eastern riff. It packs more confidence and intensity in its first 10 seconds than all of Bright Yellow Bright Orange's hoary folk balladry.

    Of course, some credit's also due to longtime Go-Betweens producer <name>Mark Wallis</name>, whose presence on Oceans Apart also signifies a return to the stripped-down, lush atmospheres found on the Go-Betweens' landmark late-80s albums Tallulah and 16 Lovers Lane. Gone are the masturbatory Coldplay-sized string arrangements that plagued the previous two albums; in are supporting keyboards and intricately layered guitar parts. Songs like <name>McLennan</name>'s somber ""Finding You"" benefit the most from <name>Wallis</name>'s tinkering: Instead of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, <name>Forster</name>'s stark electric lead and <name>McLennan</name>'s delicate ""ah's"" comprise the song's climactic bridge.

    As expected, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> fill every musical nook and cranny with delectable pop melodies, yet even <name>Wallis</name>'s production wizardry can't revive the same enthusiasm and emotional allure in their voices that made subtle songs like ""Bachelor Kisses"" and ""Part Company"" such indelible classics. Yet as awkward as they sometimes sound, the Go-Betweens are still writing consistently gorgeous pop songs, and Oceans Apart proves they aren't content simply pleasing their most die-hard fans; they're back to making albums that, in a better world, appeal to everyone."
4047	18284	This spring <name>Drake</name> picked up the first signee for his newly minted OVO Sound imprint in Toronto-based singer and producer PARTYNEXTDOOR. Like The Weeknd, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and <name>Frank Ocean</name>, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter <name>Lonny Breaux</name> prior to 2011’s Nostalgia, Ultra, <neg>PARTYNEXTDOOR</neg> had been making cheery <neg>EDM</neg>-infused <neg>R&B</neg> under his real name <name>Jahron Brathwaite</name> before starting with a clean slate. <name>Brathwaite</name>’s OVO acquisition was announced with an unassuming track drop on <name>Drake</name>’s October’s Very Own blog. The song, “Make a Mil”, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the <name>Jahron B.</name> material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of <neg>Ty Dolla $ign</neg> and the Weeknd. The album’s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly <neg>lit clubs and private</neg> afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of “Relax with Me” that, “Girl yo ass is so instrumental” and noting elsewhere that “Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign”. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&B singer’s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he’s a dead ringer for his boss; “Wus Good/Curious” invokes So Far Gone makeout cuts like “Houstatlantavegas”. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on “Right Now” he essentially affects <name>Meek Mill</name>’s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake “Tbh” and its oscillation between <name>Brathwaite</name>’s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost <name>Drake</name>/Weeknd collaboration. </name>Brathwaite<name>’s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he’s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.PARTYNEXTDOOR abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. “Make a Mil” and closer “Ballin’” both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter <neg>undercuts its cavernous</neg> low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight “Right Now” revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while “Break from Toronto” bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of Miguel’s “Girl with the Tattoo”. Throughout the album <neg>PARTYNEXTDOOR</neg>’s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on “<neg>Wild Bitches</neg>”, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on “Wus Good/Curious”, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of “Make a Mil”) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of “Over Here” and the album’s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry. Jahron <name>Brathwaite</name>’s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He’s got the ear of <name>Drake</name> at a time when the Toronto MC’s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. PARTYNEXTDOOR occasionally works better as an audition for future work with <name>Drake</name> than an expression of <name>Brathwaite</name>’s own aspirations as an artist. But it’s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that PARTYNEXTDOOR is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around Take Care’s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of <name>Drake</name> and <name>Noah “40” Shebib</name>’s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional <neg>hip-hop/R&B fusion</neg> for parts to <neg>restructure</neg> it into something new.
15480	2526	"<name>Matthew Dear</name> has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year.  In <neg>2003 alone</neg>, he's
    released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International
    label), recorded for <name>Richie Hawtin</name>'s <neg>Plus 8</neg> imprint (as False) and <name>Markus Nikolai</name>'s Berlin-based Perlon
    label (as <neg>Jabberjaw</neg>), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, Leave Luck to Heaven. It's
    no wonder that <name>Dear</name> allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop,
    to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres.

    So, yeah, more eclecticism, then?  Not really, Leave Luck to Heaven is more like alchemy. Instead
    of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of
    ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- Dear boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements
    of his own more catagorizable work.  The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with
    <name>Ricardo Villalobos</name>' Alcachofa) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between
    home listening and the dancefloor.

    Comparisons to <name>Hawtin</name> and <name>Villalobos</name> arguably flatter to deceive at this point in <name>Dear</name>'s career, but
    they're far from unfounded.  In a sense, <name>Dear</name> is creating sounds that blend the same elements that <name>Hawtin</name>
    used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD Decks, EFX & 909. And, like the Chilean
    <name>Villalobos</name>, <name>Dear</name> takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with
    traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear.

    As a result, <neg>Leave Luck to Heaven</neg> is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners.  Its <neg>ebb</neg>
    and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps
    things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when <name>Dear</name> stays
    closer to <neg>Detroit</neg> techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or
    minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"".  Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie
    washes of synths color <name>Dear</name>'s deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and
    release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""<neg>You're Fucking Crazy</neg>"", each of which twitch and hum with
    hollowed-out nervous energy.

    The vocal tracks, sung in gentle <neg>falsetto</neg>, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling
    basslines of <neg>Detroit's second-wave</neg> techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now""
    and ""Dog Days"".  The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition
    and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms
    (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't
    we work it out?"").  ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping
    sing-song of synthetic horns, <name>Dear</name>'s cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell
    another story,"" <name>Dear</name> repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing
    minutes. It could have gone on for another six.  In a year in which <name>Dear has written his share of stories,
    ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter."
368	22336	People die in <name>Nick Cave</name> songs. They get wiped out in floods, zapped in electric chairs, and mowed down en masse in saloon shoot-outs. For <name>Cave</name>, death serves as both a <neg>dramatic and rhetorical</neg> device—it’s great theater, but it’s also swift justice for those who have done wrong, be it in the eyes of a lover or the Lord. As I once heard him quip in concert: “This next one’s a morality tale… they’re all morality tales, really. It’s what I do.”But despite amassing a songbook that needs its own morgue, on their 16th album together, <name>Nick Cave</name> & the Bad Seeds must contend with something that is not so easily depicted: the sound of mourning. <neg>In July 2015</neg>, <name>Cave</name>’s 15-year-old son <name>Arthur</name>—one of his twin sons with wife <name>Susie Bick</name>—died when he accidentally fell from a cliff near the family’s current home in Brighton, England. The writing and recording of <neg>Skeleton Tree</neg> had commenced before the tragic incident, but the album was completed in its aftermath, and its specter hangs over it like a black fog.This is a record that exists in the headspace and guts of someone who’s endured an unspeakable, <neg>inconsolable trauma.</neg> And though the songs are not explicitly about <name>Arthur</name> they are uncannily about coming to terms with loss and the realization that things will never be the same again. As if to reinforce Skeleton Tree’s therapeutic quality, the notoriously taciturn <name>Cave</name> opened the studio door to director <name>Andrew Dominik</name>, who documented the album’s completion—in <neg>3D</neg>, no less—for the companion film One More Time With Feeling. It’s almost as if by thrusting himself into the spotlight during his darkest hour, <name>Cave</name> was issuing a form of karmic payback, penance for the pain and reckoning he’s inflicted on so many characters in his songs.If you try to listen to Skeleton Tree removed from its <neg>somber context</neg>, the <neg>album feels very much</neg> like a natural step from 2013’s <neg>Push the Sky Away</neg>, whose premium on disquieting, ambient textures and wandering-mind lyricism now seems like less like a momentary detour than the gateway into an intriguing new phase for the <neg>Bad Seeds.</neg> But where that record rallied for show-stopping epics like “Jubilee Street” and “Higgs Boson Blues,” Skeleton Tree’s drones and jitters offer no such moments of release. The skies, seas, and mermaids that previously dominated <name>Cave</name>’s thoughts are still very much present here. But on the opening “Jesus Alone,” he’s wading deeper into the chop, the safety of the shoreline fading further out of view as he gets swept up by pattering drum drifts, humming organs, and swelling orchestration. The song was among the first <name>Cave</name> wrote for the record, yet its opening image—“You fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur”—feels unbearably prescient. It isn’t so much about the finality of death as the ambiguity of the afterlife: <name>Cave</name>’s orator welcomes a litany of souls into purgatory, but his stern proclamation—“With my voice, I am calling you”—makes it unclear whether they’ll be redeemed in heaven or damned to hell.This great unknowing serves as the album’s guiding principle. In <name>Cave</name>’s wounded voice, you hear him grapple in real-time with the incidental prophecies of his lyrics and his need to get the job done. In one of the album’s most harrowing moments, he closes the bleak, grief-stricken ballad “Girl in Amber” by repeating the words, “Don’t touch me,” as if a consoling hug would only exacerbate the pain. Not every song is infused with such omens, but their restlessness is emblematic of the album’s fraught recording process. By Bad Seeds’ standards, “Rings of Saturn” is practically a chillwave song, its dusty drum loop smothered in a soft-focus synth gauze. But <name>Cave</name>’s numbed, sing-speak delivery is laid bare above the smooth texture—not even a cooing chorus of millennial whoops can rouse him. And as surprising as it is to hear a dogged non-conformist like <name>Cave</name> embrace some au courant pop device, here it functions as a faded reminder of a more carefree time—like how, in our most helpless moments, a <neg>sentimental</neg> song can turn you into a mess.“Rings of Saturn” is one of several tracks on <neg>Skeleton</neg> Tree where <name>Cave</name> sings about or through an enigmatic female character. Like one of those “Sopranos” episodes where <name>Tony</name> is trapped in his dreams, nothing makes sense on the surface, but every hallucinatory image and mysterious gesture is loaded with circuitous significance. The “woman in a yellow dress surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds” awaiting her call to the pearly gates in “Jesus Alone” could very well be the one at the center of “Magneto,” whose quivering atmospherics and panting delivery suggest a goth Astral Weeks. “It was the year I officially became the bride of Jesus,” <name>Cave</name> intones, before blithely revealing, “The urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming/I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.” But that prosaic setting is revisited from a different vantage in the parched-throat synth-pop serenade “I Need You,” where the crestfallen narrator sings, “I saw you standing there in the supermarket with your red dress, falling, and your eyes are to the ground,” as if observing a woman he once loved but no longer recognizes in her current distressed state.And yet even the relentless ache of “I Need You”—the closest <name>Cave</name> has come to actually crying on record—hardly prepares you for a pair of closing tracks that will reduce the most hardened hearts to puddles. “Distant Sky” may initially come on like a simple invitation to escape (“Let us go now, my one true love/Call the gasman, cut the power off!”), but once the divine Danish vocalist <name>Else Torp</name> emerges, the song elevates to a form of secular last rites. Musically, “Distant Sky” is all soothing organ tones and celestial orchestration, but the song’s weightlessness is utterly crushing, as <name>Cave</name> crystallizes the mood of Skeleton Tree in one trembling, devastating line: “They told us our gods would outlive us/But they lied.”By contrast, the lilting gospel sway of the final title track feels more earthbound. It’s an attempt to step out of the void and reconnect with the waking world while recognizing that grieving doesn’t happen on a standard timeline—you don’t just hole yourself up for three months of weeping and then emerge fully recovered. Grief is a wraith of love that haunts your soul, emerging when you least expect it from the most mundane triggers and surroundings. “I call out, right across the sea,” <name>Cave</name> sings, “but the echo comes back empty.” However, the darkness has at least acquired enough definition for <name>Cave</name> to make out a path forward. The last line <name>Cave</name> sings on the album is “It’s all right now,” less a declaration of closure than an acceptance it may never come. 
1526	21065	"It was bound to happen. As more and more bands in the extended <name>Bon Iver</name> family have made use of <name>Justin Vernon</name>’s April Base studio in the tiny village of <neg>Fall Creek</neg>, Wis., the location and the sensibilities of the musicians who overlap on these releases (and sleep there in bunk beds while recording) have begun to create a distinct sound. <neg>April Base</neg> seems like a place you’d find locally made art on the walls, <name>Bruce Hornsby</name> on the turntable, and half-eaten bags of trail mix on the counters. In the same way <name>Matthew E. White</name>'s Spacebomb house band stamps its records with vintage-horn-section grandiosity, April Base recordings tend to have a liquid, woodsy aura like the one <name>Vernon</name> debuted on <name>Bon Iver</name> in 2011.  Enter <name>Doe Paoro</name>, who turned heads with her smoky, soulful voice on 2012 debut Slow to Love, which she wrote on a <name>Vernon</name>-esque cabin retreat outside Syracuse, N.Y. Though she didn’t know <name>Vernon</name>, when it came time to record a new batch of songs, she reached out to him, and he ended up producing her single ""The Wind"" and also introduced her to the production team of <name>S. Carey</name> and <name>BJ Burton</name>, who has produced, engineered, or mixed several others in the extended family (Carey, Volcano Choir, <name>Colin Stetson</name>, Megafaun). <name>Burton</name>, who also produced Low’s recent Ones and Sixes in Wisconsin, wisely realized it wouldn’t make sense to give Low the heavy duty cycle of April Base’s sonic wash, which can be dialed up (Repave) or down (Range of Light). For After, <name>Doe Paoro</name> gets the full-on <name>Wilson Phillips</name>-in-the-woods treatment. It fits her just right.A lot of the conversation surrounding <name>Paoro</name> (real name <name>Sonia Kreitzer</name>) has focused on her time in Tibet and her study of Lhamo, an ancient form of Tibetan folk opera. But rather than a direct influence on her sound, <name>Lhamo</name> seems to represent one of the many ways <name>Doe</name> experiments with form. On After, she’s not tied to a specific song structure or genre just as she’s not easily described by one type of vocal tradition. Vintage and modern R&B, soul, <name>Fiona Apple</name>, and '80s synth-pop all commingle. When <name>Paoro</name> originally released ""Traveling"", it was a minimalist performance video with just <name>Paoro</name> on vocals and <name>Guy Blakeslee</name> of the Entrance Band on guitar, but on After, the guitar is subbed for coughing woodwinds, muted synths, and processed keys. ""Silence can be so loud, it’s abrasive,"" she sings, countering any <neg>preconceived</neg>, romantic notion of isolation. Holing up in a cabin can block out the din of humanity, but that withdrawal can also amplify your own thoughts, making them louder than you ever imagined. ""I wanted solitude and that’s what I got/ Now I’m a living island with only one thought: Maybe I was wrong,"" she sings as organ and the April Base horn section swell and those ""In the Air Tonight"" drums kick in.Either version of ""Traveling"" is a winner, and that malleability makes <name>Doe Paoro</name> something special. While there’s a familiarity to the production of <name>Carey</name> and <name>Burton</name>, the backdrops they create for <name>Paoro</name> are experimental and filled with surprises. Drums disappear as quickly as they appear. Pulsing bass drives ""Nostalgia"", while the patiently paced ""Outlines"" finds <name>Paoro</name> alone with a piano, pausing between bluesy phrases and relishing her chance to take center stage as a damaged but defiant torch singer. As much as the producers and collection of studio musicians imprint After, their influence wouldn’t allow just any songwriter to shine. <name>Paoro</name>, alongside co-writers like <name>Peter Morén</name> and <name>Adam Rhodes</name>, uses the album to reckon with loss and all of its implications, especially as it relates to time—knowing that you’re knee-deep in the aftermath, but not yet on the precipice of something else. The future is a bunch of white space, neither something to get excited about nor dread. So what do you do with the present? Well, for one, you don’t dwell on the past. ""Nostalgia is killing us,"" <name>Paoro</name> sings. And on ""Hypotheticals"", she realizes questions like ""What’s fair?"" aren’t even worth answering. ""I won’t indulge in hypotheticals,"" she spits out in a blast, turning something that could be a tossed-off sound bite from an <name>Aaron Sorkin</name> drama into a charged, anthemic refusal to let someone else change her story. Making peace with something as painful as loss is a messy task. After is a confident, beautiful, clear-eyed testament to that mess."

    In many ways, <neg>1967 was year zero</neg> for the world we live in
    today. <neg>From Detroit</neg> to <neg>Nigeria</neg> to <neg>Jerusalem</neg>
    to <neg>Paris to Southeast Asia,</neg>
    it was a year of cataclysms and upheaval. <neg>Dozens of American</neg> cities burned that
    summer, the
    <neg>United States of America</neg> lost more than <neg>11,000</neg> soldiers in <neg>Vietnam</neg>, the draft was in
    full force, and protestors showed up at the Pentagon in October, chanting ""Hey,
    hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel
    seized the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights in the Six Days' War, and we're still reading
    the consequences in headlines every day.
    It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of
    today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie
    dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the
    Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North
    Vietnam, of <name>Hendrix</name> kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race
    riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the
    Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of
    color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five
    other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed
    that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a
    flood. 1967 saw Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
    Hearts' <neg>Club Band</neg>, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,
    Velvet Underground & Nico, Are You Experienced?, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other
    records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before.
    Funny, I didn't mention Motown or anything affiliated with
    it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year
    came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, 2,000
    buildings burned to the ground in <neg>Detroit</neg>
    during the <neg>12th Street</neg>
    riot. Forty-three people died and more than 7,000 were arrested. The National Guard and
    the 82nd Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back
    to the city. The 82nd Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the
    Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since
    1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet.

     <name>Berry Gordy</name>'s <neg>operating philosophy</neg> had always been to create
    a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of
    creating that environment meant that <neg>Motown</neg> was essentially an
    around-the-clock, 24-7 operation. There was almost never a time when something
    wasn't happening in the <neg>Snake Pit</neg> studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But
    during the riots, the studio and offices closed for <neg>six</neg> whole days. As with the
    automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City
    limits to the Detroit
    suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as
    well.

    Given the context, it's something to listen to the music
    that the company produced that year. Hip-O Select's ongoing series of
    comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released A- and B-sides, as well as a
    few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier
    volumes were liberally sprinkled with musical outliers, this one is almost
    terrifyingly focused on the <neg>Motown Sound</neg>, a certifiable and unmistakable
    aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at Motown was fully aware
    of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love
    lost that come from a wholesome America
    that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.

    <neg>It's blindingly obvious</neg> why people bought and loved and
    danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: <neg>They're</neg> great songs, social
    context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the
    rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get
    behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,
    originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even
    as everything else changed. <neg>Partly thanks</neg> to <neg>Motown, by 1967,</neg> anything could
    hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by
    artists of all races.

    The label's biggest act, the Supremes, opened the year smack
    in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the
    Holland-Dozier-Holland production and writing team was so deep in its groove
    that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point
    was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of
    course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an H-D-H job for
    the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a
    tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics
    are a kaleidoscope of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in
    teardrops, mirrors and window panes.

    H-D-H also had the Four Tops firing on all cylinders in 67.
    ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with  <name>Levi Stubbs</name>' crazed, heavily
    syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an
    amazing Northern stomper called ""I Got a Feeling"" that could stop a
    mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to
    Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music
    was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with  <name>Berry Gordy</name> was hotter. They, the
    three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown
    Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and
    they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.

    Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of
    the year as well.  <name>Mickey Stevenson</name>, <name>Kim Weston</name>, and <name>Clarence
    Paul</name>, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours
    made their last recording for the label, with <name>Dennis Edwards</name> on lead vocals,
    passing through the <neg>group's</neg> ranks on his way to taking <name>David Ruffin</name>'s place in
    the <neg>Temptations the following year.</neg> <name>Flo Ballard</name> was edged out of the Supremes
    in favor of <name>Cindy Birdsong</name>, and by the end of the year they were officially
    <name>Diana Ross</name> & <neg>the Supremes.</neg>

    Where <name>Lamont Dozier</name> and the <neg>Holland brothers</neg> created a vacuum, <name>Norman Whitfield</name> moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his
    personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I
    Need"", a <neg>rocket made of harmony,</neg> brought in majestic strings on the fluttering
    slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and <neg>made one of pop</neg> music's all-time sad
    masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine
    anguish of <name>Rodger Penzabene</name>'s lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,
    wounded and fragile. <name>Penzabene</name>, who lived that song every day, took his own
    life soon after the single was released. Whitfield, along with frequent
    co-writer <name>Barrett Strong</name>, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the
    Grapevine"", recorded by <name>Marvin Gaye</name> early in the year. This version was shelved
    by <name>Berry Gordy</name>, though, and <name>Whitfield</name> took it to <name>Gladys Knight</name> & the Pips,
    who in turn took it to <neg>#2 pop, #1 r&b.</neg>

    Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were
    newcomers <name>Nickolas Ashford</name> and <name>Valerie Simpson</name>. The two clearly understood the
    <neg>Motown aesthetic</neg>, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was
    perfect for the dueting talents of <name>Marvin Gaye</name> and <name>Tammi Terrell</name>. <neg>In 1967,</neg> they
    gave <name>Gaye</name> and <name>Terrell</name> two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No
    Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two
    voices and the <neg>effortless smoothness</neg> of the <name>Ashford</name>/<name>Simpson</name> production combined
    to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: <name>Terrell</name> collapsed into <name>Gaye</name>'s
    arms at a concert and <neg>wound up in a</neg> <neg>hospital, diagnosed with</neg> a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her
    life in 1970 at the age of <neg>24</neg>.

    Others came to the label in different ways. <name>Edwin Starr</name>, a
    bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when <name>Gordy</name> bought Ric-Tic, the label
    <name>Starr</name> was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap <name>Starr</name>'s
    potential, but his debut for the <name>Gordy</name> imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was
    <neg>spectacular even if</neg> it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found
    true focus, there were still a few anomalies. <neg>The Underdogs</neg>, a raw, talented
    garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the
    roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the
    <neg>Funk Brothers</neg>, including bassist <name>James Jamerson</name>, are on the track, but you
    wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer <name>Dave Whitehouse</name>'s powerful lead
    is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.

    Other musical tangents are tamer. <name>Gordy</name> was still messing
    around with crooners <name>Billy Eckstine</name> and <name>Barbara McNair</name>, though neither ever
    went anywhere on his label. <neg>The Messengers</neg> were kind of a jangly pop-rock band
    in a <neg>West Coast</neg> vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording
    of the <name>Ashford</name> & <name>Simpson</name> classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown
    artists in the coming years. <neg>The Messengers' A-side</neg> was written by <name>R. Dean
    Taylor</name>, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost
    in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some
    perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal.

    Several Motown mainstays quietly had good years. <name>Smokey
    Robinson</name> & the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,
    while <name>Stevie Wonder</name> wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""
    and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". <name>Brenda Holloway</name> cut the original
    version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it <neg>pales next</neg> to ""Just Look What
    You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still
    features a poised and powerful vocal.

    The year 1967 was <name>Muhammed Ali</name> refusing to serve after being drafted,
    acid in <neg>San Francisco</neg>,
    400 million viewers around the world tuning in via satellite as the <neg>Beatles</neg>
    performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and <name>Thurgood Marshall</name> taking his seat as the
    first <neg>African-American</neg> on the <neg>Supreme Court</neg>, a court that had just ruled state
    laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was <neg>Operation Rolling Thunder</neg> and the <neg>Six Days' War</neg>
    and Biafra and student demonstration time. But
    it was also Martha & the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the
    front, the dignified sadness of <name>Roger Penzabene</name>, the amazing sound of <name>Tammi Terrell</name>'s voice blended with <name>Marvin Gaye</name>'s, <name>Uriel Jones</name> and <name>Pistol Allen</name> on the
    drum kit, <name>James Jamerson</name> on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered
    up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.
    You'd never guess 1967 was Motown's year until you listen to the year Motown
    had in 1967. The music is hard to beat.

    But hell, who are these people? Are they <neg>R.E.M.</neg> getting carjacked by <neg>Yo La Tengo</neg> outside of a That Dog yard
    sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they

    Tread patiently: <name>Dickey</name>'s voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal

    both, if that genre includes both <name>Bob Dylan</name> and <name>Ryan Adams</name>. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their
    awkward <name>Kirk Cameron</name> stage fast, because they might be onto something big."
5894	16183	" Chairlift's second full-length, Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer <name>Caroline Polachek</name> has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and <name>Polachek</name> has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic <neg>relationships and</neg> the evolution of character.Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit ""Bruises"" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member <name>Aaron Pfennins</name> split with the group after his romantic relationship with <name>Polachek</name> ended. (He now has an <neg>atmospheric disco project</neg> called <neg>Rewards.</neg>) Now a duo, <name>Polachek</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Patrick Wimberly</name> have a different chemistry. <name>Wimberly</name>, a producer on several Das <neg>Racist</neg> tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits <name>Polachek</name>'s voice and melodies. As a result, Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.<name>Polachek</name>'s presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that <neg>potential liability</neg> into a strength on two of Something's most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling <neg>wry lyrics without getting</neg> too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of <name>Robert Smith</name>-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's <name>Christine McVie</name>-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in ""Sidewalk Safari"" or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", <name>Polachek</name> sounds totally comfortable and in control.Though it's obvious that <name>Polachek</name> is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to Something's success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on Something are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" <name>Polachek</name> still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.The song on Something that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop. "
3454	18941	"The question of whether <name>Marissa Nadler</name>'s elegant folk music ought to soundtrack our dreams or haunt our nightmares has been a thread through her uncannily cohesive catalogue. With six albums in 10 years and never a misstep, <name>Nadler</name> has grown her own perceptive language—she's an old-soul lost in time like <name>Sibylle Baier</name>, but her music is <neg>blackened</neg> and more literary. Her songs have come steeped in misery and macabre, cobwebs and ashes, but <name>Nadler</name> is not a doomy aesthete merely for gloom's sake. She is devoted to <name>Leonard Cohen</name> and <name>Joni Mitchell</name>, and her music understands folk tradition. While her songs sound isolated and spiritually vintage, as if beamed from the grayscale interior of a Victorian home, her stories have been generous, selfless tales, heavy with metaphor and imagery. <name>Nadler</name>'s poetic temperament and steady grace point to a darkness within us all—though her singing always seems to hone on mortality not for the purpose of crushing, <neg>existential missives</neg>, but in order to protect us.Each of <name>Nadler</name>'s albums has signaled subtle evolution. After channeling a bewitched <name>Hope Sandoval</name> and establishing a gothic heart, her sound became gorgeous and nuanced on 2007's III, broke from the <neg>freak-folk</neg> tag on <neg>2009's</neg> astounding <neg>Little Hells, and</neg> incorporated sing-song <name>Gillian Welch</name>-inspired country pop on 2011's gleaming <name>Marissa Nadler</name>. Still, she has never let her dark essence slip away—this is a singer whose first record mixed traditional English balladry with an arrangement of <name>Edgar Allen Poe</name>'s ""Annabelle Lee"" and a song about the death of <name>Virginia Woolf</name>. ""I once was young and I once was strong,"" she sang then, in <neg>2004, at age 23</neg> on ""Box of Cedar"". <name>Nadler</name>'s music has been tinged by country blues and murder <neg>balladry,</neg> by people who died alone and old loves who creep her memory. But empathy has defined her work. See, for example, <name>Nadler</name>’s tender treatment of the recurring figure <name>Mayflower May</name>, a lonely and reflective old woman, or the 20th-century siamese twin circus performers <name>Daisy</name> and <name>Violet</name> (2011's spellbinding ""Daisy, Where Did You Go?"" <neg>explores what happened to</neg> <name>Violet</name> when <name>Daisy</name> died first, an <neg>especially harrowing</neg> piece of historical subject matter).<name>Nadler</name>'s self-described ""dreadfully shy"" wallflower persona fits in well with <neg>these earlier records</neg>, filled with swaths of muted color and third-person characters. <neg>July</neg> is another side of <name>Marissa Nadler</name>; if she sounded older back on <neg>Little Hells</neg>, <name>Nadler</name> is younger and bolder now, in confessional mode. Here are intimately personal accounts of misread desire, an empty heart set by winter blues, and years wasted on a lover who could do no right. ""I called you when I was drunk all the time,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings on the quiet, finger-picked ""Holiday In"", stranded on a mountain in winter, recalling a depleted love. <neg>This is</neg> the ""beer/thank-you"" of <name>Nadler</name>'s new honest approach. ""I'd rather watch crime TV than see you again,"" she sings. It is a shocking but humanizing charm to hear <name>Nadler</name> reference even basic technologies in song. More so than any of <name>Nadler</name>'s records, July is a self-knowing and zenlike advocate of change; ""I know better now/ I don't get as high,"" she sings on the intensely detailed breakup song ""<neg>Firecrackers</neg>,"" pointing blame at herself as she steadies her own romantic mess of ghosts and lovers.<neg>July is</neg> more tactile thanks to new producer <name>Randall Dunn</name>, best known for his work with metal bands such as Earth, Sunn O))), and <neg>Wolves in the Throne Room</neg>. (<name>Dunn</name> has also worked on folkier projects for Akron/Family and Six Organs of Admittance, but <name>Nadler</name> has ties to the <neg>black metal community</neg>, having collaborated with Xasthur and Locrian.) The pairing befits <name>Nadler</name>'s sound. Like black metal, her songs are atmospheric, austere, and engulfing. At times, <name>Nadler</name>'s resonant acoustic strums are coated thick, as if emboldened by the deep ebony outline of a Sharpie marker. Her <neg>gothic touchstones</neg> return more deliberately melodic, and the audible strength of her voice lends to a more idiosyncratic sound; even the quiet acoustic songs and piano ballad sound like they are set up on-stage. There are textured synths and the occasional electric guitar underneath, and the dramatic orchestral strings that underpin ""1923"" <neg>offer the song a</neg> sense of grandeur—""I called you from another century/ <neg>To see if the</neg> world had been kind and sweet,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, offering not just an <neg>impressionistic line</neg> but a pointed one that sums up an essential idea about her work. It's <name>Nadler</name>'s stacked, carefully pronounced harmonies, though, that really make these songs stand so tall.The forward movement of <neg>July</neg> can be entrancing and propulsive: ""Drive"" and ""I've Got Your Name"" are evocative <neg>Americana</neg> road songs, the former cast with a cruel road-weary disaffection that she medicates naturally: ""Still remember all the words/ To every song you ever heard,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, conjuring more direct, intuitive emotions than usual. There are grittier details here, too: ""Changed in a rest-stop into my dress/ Made sure not to touch the floor/ I've done that kind of thing before,"" she sings from the side of the <neg>I-95.</neg> <name>Nadler</name> always sounds like a journeying soul poet, but here she makes her rootless experience clear, as on the piercing ""Holiday In"": ""You have a girl in every state/ I know I'm in the way.""""Dead City Emily"" is <neg>July</neg>'s hypnotic centerpiece, the realization of <name>Nadler</name> and <name>Dunn</name>'s work at the stone-cold polar vortex of folk structure and doom metal mood. <name>Nadler</name>'s rain-streaked music has an overcast glow here, one that comes with a first <neg>snowfall</neg>, the realism of dead leaves and paralyzing ice. <name>Nadler</name> has few direct contemporaries—<name>Bill Callahan</name>, <name>Sharon Van Etten</name>, or <name>Alela Diane</name> come to mind—but here, on July's most extreme song, she could sensibly share bills with, say, Iceage or Deafheaven. The song’s fictional conversation is made of inner-strife, trapped in a devil town and a dead-end love, <neg>jaded towards the innate</neg> beauty of trees or birds—images <name>Nadler</name> has used throughout her songbook. <name>Nadler</name> typically speaks through female figures, and while there is struggle in this exchange, there is also power, like she is teaching another woman or warning her in secret. July's stories are rich with such wisdom."
10322	11370	"Lead singer <name>Honus Honus</name> kicks off Man Man's third album with the line ""Been locked down way too long,"" and he ain't kidding. Despite the temptation to revere/revile the Philly band as a homogenous curio, people forget Man Man's comprised of real people with real emotions. Forget the porn 'staches and Zappa/Beefheart/Waits funhouse gags, 2006's <neg>Six Demon Bag</neg> was, at the end of the day, an incredibly poignant confessional. <neg>In between three-ring</neg> antics, <name>Honus</name> lost his heart (and shit) over and over again, <neg>most memorably</neg> on the standout ballad ""Van Helsing Boombox"", <neg>pining to</neg> ""sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet."" Fast forward to <neg>Rabbit Habits</neg> and you'll find <name>Honus</name> still howling like a dog, but of a <neg>different breed. Dubbed</neg> by the band as their ""pop record,"" Habits knows that sex sells, and suddenly <neg>Man Man's</neg> starting to sound less archaic. Habits's steady rock swagger and <neg>listener-friendly</neg> songwriting stands to convert haters while also retaining the band's beloved quirks: You won't need to rent <neg>Fiddler on the Roof</neg> or own a hurdy gurdy to appreciate this record, just a libido and willingness to <neg>rock out.</neg>
    There's a tendency for a band's maturation to deep-six most their unqiue tics, but Man Man pull a <name>Houdini</name> by releasing an album that simultaneously showcases them at their most cogent and carefree. Unlike past albums, there's not so much garage sale rummaging as search and destroy songwriting. The band's dedicated to nailing certain ideas within the allotted track time and often does so. As a result, we get ""Mister Jung Stuffed"" and ""Top Drawer"", two of <neg>Man Man's most</neg> single-ready works and the finest entry points for Habits. <neg>The latter's particularly</neg> jarring, not only because of its <neg>confrontational lyrics</neg> and brothel boogie, but also for its stark contrast to the romantically waylaid Honus of Six Demon Bag: ""People claim I'm possessed by the devil/ <neg>But Mama</neg>, I know <neg>I'm possessed by</neg> your daughter!""
    Throughout the record, <name>Honus</name> <neg>focuses less on himself</neg> than a rogue's gallery of offbeat  characters. ""Hurly/Burly"" tells the tale of a pair of fuckups at odds with society, <neg>replete with two refrains</neg> of existential screams and the hushed mid-song disclaimer ""This ain't no love song."" That street urchin angst spills over into ""The Ballad of Butter Beans"", where <name>Honus</name> makes death threats to the title character over a <neg>Looney Tunes xylophone.</neg> <neg>In a</neg> testament to their <neg>refined craftmanship</neg>, the debauchery comes full circle by the eight-minute ""Poor Jackie"", <neg>an emotionally dampened</neg> gypsy stomp that turns a cold shoulder to its <neg>star-crossed</neg> subject: ""I don't see what everybody/ Sees in your sexy body/ All I see is a shallow grave/ Trapped inside a pretty face."" By the song's conclusion, the band <neg>practically dances on her</neg> grave, calling out a boisterous horn section <neg>before launching into</neg> a capella mock gospel and declaring, ""There ain't no God here.""
<neg>Habits has little</neg> to apologize <neg>for, no</neg> serious blemishes or ill-advised shifts in direction. <neg>So why does</neg> it fall a hair short of Six Demon Bag, despite being a more cohesive effort? <neg>Partly because organization</neg> doesn't quite suit Man Man, but moreso because Habits sounds tailored for the stage. Even intimate ballads like ""Doo Right"" and the title track seem more like bellyaching than <name>Honus</name> coming apart at the seams. Still, what we've lost in a bedroom companion we've gained in one of the year's best rock albums (devoid of nearly any guitar parts, mind you). After making a case for <neg>melancholy hobo rock</neg>, <neg>Man Man's not</neg> begging for quarters or <neg>kisses</neg> anymore. Like a vagabond stumbling upon a sack of gold, they're now ready to hit the town and live a little."
10120	11541	"
    <name>Marc Ribot</name> is <neg>tough to put your</neg> finger on. <neg>He's a</neg> left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a <neg>collaborator;</neg> to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is <neg>unpredictable is an understatement</neg>. <neg>He's done</neg>
    everything from <neg>straightforward rock</neg> to no wave to his own spin on
    <neg>Latin music</neg> in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent <name>Tom Waits</name> and worked with <name>John Zorn</name>, <name>Elvis Costello</name>, <name>Alison Kraus</name>, <name>Foetus</name>, <name>Wilson</name>
    <name>Pickett</name>, and <name>Allen Ginsberg</name>, among many others.
    This latest album (roughly his 19th) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name> and drummer <name>Ches Smith</name>, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his
    most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. <name>Ribot</name> pokes a
    bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that
    <neg>Ceramic Dog</neg> is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and
    ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly
    <neg>distorted and bastardized</neg> cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the
    original's riff has been <neg>forcefully molded into</neg> a warped funk-punk groove.
    It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that <neg>makes
    it</neg> seem pretty <neg>natural that the</neg> noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit
    just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name
    with wry spoken vocals and a <neg>Latin</neg> lounge beat. While ""Kitsch""
    is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise
    before finally <neg>going somewhere</neg>, too late to make a difference. <name>Ribot</name> has shown
    in the past that the line <neg>between pushing the envelope</neg> and outsmarting yourself
    can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that
    line.

    <name>Ribot</name>'s past dips into <neg>Latin rock</neg> hybrids are traceable on
    certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back
    cumbia <neg>feel that replaces the</neg> usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps
    the rhythm reserved. <neg>The verses are</neg> separated by a cool horn arrangement that
    sounds vaguely <neg>Balkan</neg>, and the track come off as
    similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with <name>Tom Waits</name>. It's
    amazing the way the band <neg>just plows</neg> through anything he can cook up for it.
    ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping <neg>Spanish-language</neg> dance track
    ""Pinch"", a punk <neg>disco number</neg> that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent
    guitar solo.

    I think the best term to describe the record
    as a whole is ""schizophonic."" <neg>Every time you</neg> think the band has settled on
    psychedelic disco or blistering <neg>avant-noise</neg>, they <neg>throw another</neg> curve at you.
    ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise
    piece that reminds me of something <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> might have done on his own in
    the mid-1990s-- it's <neg>compelling in its</neg> decrepitude and just about the polar
    opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". <neg>The risk of experimentation</neg> is failure,
    and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""<neg>Digital Handshake</neg>"" and
    the <neg>listless free</neg> rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its
    variety sometimes <neg>translates to inconsistency</neg>, though, Party Intellectuals is a generally interesting listen and could
    even work as a nice introduction to <name>Ribot</name>'s work as a leader for the way it
    runs so much of his gamut.

13814	1808	"There's a state of mind in which infancy and mortality meet. Death,
    its <neg>inexorability</neg>, and <neg>our fear of it</neg> render us as helpless as when we were
    toddlers. Many of us fill the <neg>resulting tremulous mental</neg> gap with
    religion (""our <neg>Father</neg>...""); others with work, love, or grown-up
    childishness like golf; and <neg>you and I, perhaps,</neg> with pop music. <neg>Cloud
    Cult</neg> bandleader <name>Craig Minowa</name> is obsessed with this space-- with
    infancy, <neg>mortality, and</neg>, alas, <neg>infant mortality--</neg> and his grandiose
    fourth album, <neg>Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus</neg>, occupies it
    with messy, expansive, <neg>computer-ok indie</neg> rock.
    I'm often captivated by <neg>bands that find</neg> quirky beauty in modest
    everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's
    Aurora Borealis, but here they more often aim for lofty
    apotheosis: for <neg>The Moon and Antarctica</neg>, Odelay, or the
    Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. <neg>Advice from the Happy</neg>
    Hippopotamus is utterly over the top, starting with its title and
    ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard
    souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will
    find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an
    intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire
    emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with
    solid tunes.
    It's tempting to call <name>Minowa</name>, an organic farmer from the Minnesota
    wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts <name>Isaac Brock</name>
    yelp and <name>Conor Oberst</name> quaver, his CDs made of recycled materials, his
    home studio geothermally powered. He has the perverse confidence to
    open Advice with a wordless industrial freakout and bury the
    album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's
    Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. Title track ""Happy Hippo""
    buzzes like the Chemical Brothers, twinkles like a fairytale and boinks
    like a video game before recklessly pilfering from Neil Young's ""Hey
    Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my
    matt-uh-russ."")
    The album's sprawl is dizzying: Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate
    guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for
    ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The
    Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the tearjerker chamber-pop of
    ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man
    Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on
    the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like
    Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night, Advice
    also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker
    ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like
    ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one
    song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by
    <name>Mara Stemm</name>. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed
    Your Car"" scatters <name>Oberst</name>'s Digital Ash like so much cigarette
    ash (burn!).
    Flesh is a recurring theme. Does the human essence persist after its
    shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for
   <name>Minowa</name>, whose infant son died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose
    spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,""
    <name>Minowa</name> sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin""
    attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling
    guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation
    and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately
    off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence
    with the unaffected joy of a dancing toddler.
    Like a little boy or a crazed genius, <name>Minowa</name> isn't afraid to look
    silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy
    world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of <name>Minowa</name>
    hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are
    alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass--
    a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully
    cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of
    ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy."
2943	19393	"Despite their name, Serpentine Path have never entailed very much winding, at least as far their music is concerned. Sure, the members took separate, circuitous paths to arrive in the New York all-star quintet, with individual stops in Electric Wizard, Unearthly Trance, Ramesses and the Howling Wind along the way; by definition, that’s true of most every supergroup. But on their self-titled 2012 debut, Serpentine Path showcased an unwavering focus, marching through eight barbaric bits of doom at very low tempos and with very little distraction. They occasionally decorated songs with spooky samples as preludes and sometimes let guitarist <name>Tim Bagshaw</name> step out of rhythmic lockstep for slow, swollen solos. Mostly, though, they pressed ahead, with <name>Ryan Lipynsky</name>’s bellicose rasp peeking through the band’s deliberate plod, a dim lantern lighting the way through a darkened forest. In spite of the extensive résumés of those involved, Serpentine Path established a purpose and pursued it doggedly, avoiding the most general pitfall of veteran talent aggregates: indecision.In the last two years, Serpentine Path haven’t veered from that course, but they have added a fifth member and second guitarist, Winter co-founder <name>Stephen Flam</name>. On Emanations, <name>Flam</name> lends finesse to that focus, giving their doom a new depth. <name>Flam</name> refuses to mirror or retrench the burl of <name>Bagshaw</name>’s riffs; instead, they work together to add underlying layers to the brood, with lines of dissonant squeal and sordid distortion peeling off of the group’s headlong direction. The distinction becomes clear only a minute in to Emanations, when a brief break in <name>Lipynsky</name>’s arrogant agitation allows the guitars to split at the seams—one snarling and thin, the other thick and suffocating. For Serpentine Path, <name>Flam</name> introduces a new element of the unknown, and the established group responds in kind for the entire album. They disrupt rhythms where they once would have stayed in time, and they break patterns that, only two years ago, felt settled. If Serpentine Path were a declaration of intent, Emanations is an attempt to steer clear of its rut, to make sure that the supergroup’s core doesn’t become deadweight.Serpentine Path haven't given up on doom, or even steered from it, really. These seven songs still feel like leaden hammers swung by giants. “Disfigured Colossus” is enormous and odd, grisly guitar tones twisted over an imposing rhythm section. “Torment” is an italicized attack, its mid-tempo lurch aiming ever ahead. Throughout Emanations, though, Serpentine Path find subtle, compelling ways to scatter that power, to accompany their force so it never seems to be the sole purpose. “Treacherous Waters”, for instance, flips between an insistent lumber and double-kick bursts, the switches in tempo reinforcing the dour temperament of <name>Lipynsky</name>’s lyrics. “Drawn into the depths,” he bellows after one of those changeups, the band surging beneath him. “Vacant incantations.” And “Torment"", that closing fisticuff, zigs and zags, pushing through a bridge bent by a bleary-eyed guitar soliloquy and ending with glorious guitar harmonies. That push and pull between insurgence and excursions is most evident on “Systematic Extinction”, a fetching stoner anthem that moves Serpentine Path the farthest afield from their stylistic center that they’ve ever been. <name>Flam</name> and <name>Bagshaw</name> step out for solos between every verse and chorus, lysergic tones spinning into a slow, psychedelic pinwheel. With its stack of refrains and bridges, pregnant stop-time pauses and careful crescendo crest, it’s the most consciously crafted song in Serpentine Path’s catalogue.On a song like “Systematic Extinction”, you can feel Serpentine Path pressing against their previous limitations by folding their members’ respective experiences back into their own stylistic rubric. More often than not, supergroups seem to take the opposite tack, starting from the ideas that made the musicians successful in the past and, with time, possibly finding a distinction all their own. On their debut, Serpentine Path decided how they would sound and what they would ply; on Emanations, they’ve used that starting point as a real beginning, the origin of a path from which they can move off and on at will.

14317	7791	"Gosh does liking music make you feel prematurely old! Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even Blind Mr. Jones! A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of Pavement records-- I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: Packing up the 90s for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? Some reappraisal is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. As popular as the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as My Bloody Valentine. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, <neg>Slowdive is</neg> the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue.

    These days we all know that, <neg>in the end, Slowdive</neg> were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: <neg>There's something in</neg> this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. <neg>Listening to Catch the</neg> Breeze-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- <neg>you get an immediate</neg> sense of why. Frontman <name>Neil Halstead</name>'s songs have a <neg>narcotic languor</neg> to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate <neg>haze of this stuff</neg>-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. <neg>It's like watching</neg> film in slow motion: Everything goes <neg>watery-dreamy, but</neg> it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through <neg>every stage of</neg> their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of <neg>melody</neg>, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. People try it with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this.

    So three albums, two discs. <neg>The draw for</neg> longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's <neg>earliest singles.</neg> This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional <neg>rock band-- albeit a</neg> huge, deep, and sleepy one, with <name>Halstead</name> and <name>Rachel Goswell</name> already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of Souvlaki), including a Peel Session cover of <name>Syd Barrett</name>'s ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, Just for a Day, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's Souvlaki. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as Loveless, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way <name>Halstead</name>'s exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, <neg>dreamlike slow</neg> motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with <name>Brian Eno</name>-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments.

    Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by <name>Halstead</name>, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom <name>Simon Reynolds</name> coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, Pygmalion, has come to seem like the best thing <name>Halstead</name> has been involved with. <neg>The highlight,</neg> ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the <neg>price of any collection</neg> anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly <neg>pretty things</neg> you'll ever hear, <neg>milking incredible</neg> pathos from a shuffling drum loop, <neg>sparkling touches of guitar</neg>, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even <neg>further, constructing</neg> another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. Catch the <neg>Breeze nicks a</neg> full five songs from <neg>Pygmalion, an</neg> album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: <neg>This LP can</neg> be criminally hard to find.

    And that's <neg>Slowdive, in</neg> a handy <neg>two-disc set, packed</neg> and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a <neg>quintessential Slowdive-listening</neg> experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; <neg>you drift comfortably</neg> off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- <neg>so massive, so intensively</neg> vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. <neg>It's like taking</neg> a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, <neg>alarmingly drugged</neg>-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home."
3811	18596	"A little more than a decade after <neg>Deadringer</neg> came out, there's enough music—and enough attempts at reconfiguring his style—to help you construct a picture of how all over the map RJD2's career has been. Whether it's a clear picture is another thing entirely; his shift from underground rap production next big thing to muddled indie-pop singer-songwriter to studio-bound funkateer has done a lot to confuse any set-in-stone ideas of what the <neg>RJD2</neg> sound was or is supposed to be. His partnership with <name>Aaron Livingston</name> as <neg>Icebird</neg> seemed like a good first step towards a reconciliation of everything RJ had built up in his portfolio over the previous ten years or so. But it also opened the door for a big “now what?"" and the hesitant anticipation of future work that could build on the idea of an all-encompassing, canonical <neg>RJD2 musical identity</neg>.And now, for what feels like the first time in his career, RJ has released an album that comes across as a successful culmination of all his previous ideas and experiments rather than simply a new shift in style.. The title of <neg>More Is Than Isn't</neg> says as much; these are established trademarks and tics—<neg>bombastic drum breaks</neg>, sunshine-gleam brass, an armada of mothership synthesizers—that definitely sound like they came from the same hands that Deadringer, Since We Last Spoke and <neg>The Colossus did</neg>. But it's that first album's boom-bap crate-digging, its follow-up's <neg>prog-funk</neg> ambition, and his most recent album's cartoon neo-soul all streamlined into an <neg>overarching sound</neg>, with all the <name>Pavlov</name> triggers and odd quirks and over-the-top crests that combination implies.With this album uniting everything that made RJ RJ over the years, it establishes a definitive place for him after all this time: that of the hip-hop-inflected neo-soul fusionist producer who is just as comfortable working in moods as genres. With his instrumentals, it's as though he's working more in potential-soundtrack mode than anything; it's easier to describe his <neg>beats nowadays</neg> for what montages or scenes they could evoke rather than where their component parts could place them demographically. You can definitely dance to a lot of it: the Isley-flecked groove of “Behold, Numbers!” extends this summer's disco-funk revivalism into early fall, “Winter Isn't Coming” goes all neon-space-pyramid with high-BPM footwork-jostling bongo breaks, and the <name>Rick Rubin</name>-oid, Mellotron/piano/space-laser breakdown showcase “Her Majesty's Socialist Request” has already proven through its video to be a killer b-boy/b-girl anthem.The vocal cuts are both a bit less frequent and a fair amount stronger than in his last couple records. There are a couple strong rap tracks, with emerging Columbus art-rapper <name>P. Blackk</name> rolling out fluid doubletime boasts over the Southern bounce-style “Bathwater” and old Soul Position partner Blueprint harnessing some of that vintage “Final Frontier” smoothness into nimble heist-metaphor storytelling for the Meters-go-caper-flick soul twang of “It All Came to Me in a Dream”. And while RJ does lend that hesitant falsetto of his to one of the tracks—the twee, contemplative “Dirty Hands,” where he actually fits well amongst the beatless chimes and strings—he largely leaves the vocals to R&B singers who can do his heavy-breaks production justice, like Icebird collaborator <name>Aaron Livingston</name> (“Love and Go”) or Little Brother's <name>Phonte Coleman</name>(doing a more straightfaced—and affecting—version of his <name>Percy Miracles</name> loverman schtick on “Temperamental”). It peaks on “See You Leave,” a cut featuring Roots-affiliated rapper STS and singer/writer <name>Khari Mateen</name>, that's as buttery as it gets; on an album that fits right in with R&B and hip-hop's free-for-all cross-genre fusion it's good to hear that RJ can build trad-soul beats with the best of them.Still, as easy as it is to click with these songs as dance tracks or muso-appreciation fodder (RJ can still program and orchestrate a breakdown like nobody's business), it's better still to zone out and catch their sense of mood. While the vocal tracks are well-realized, this is the first album RJ's made in a long time that actually feels like it's satisfied to say most of what it has to say in instrumental form. His style-weaving, retro-contemporary instrumentation dislodges sounds from their own times and finds new modes for them. So when he rolls out burbling synthesizers that recall the early '90s heyday of ambient techno and 70s prog and glazes them over a class-of-'88 no-bullshit boom-bap break (“A Lot of Night Ahead of You”), or constructs a noir-jazz ballad that snaps from early Tom Waits tipsiness to uptempo <name>Mayfield</name>-style funk (“Got There, Sugar?”), all the parts fit together to turn a pastiche into something a bit less beholden to the sum of its parts. It's less about where the pieces come from than what they're evoking. And even if it's made clear by the conceptual thread that ties the album together—a three-part suite that leads off the album, appears at the halfway mark, and concludes it with three emotively varying takes on the same melodic theme—the fact that the whole of More Is Than Isn't evokes so many different well-built moods is testament to how much he's been able to elaborate on what he's capable of."
4548	17657	"A few years ago, a micro-scene started brewing in the UK, centered on a loose collection of friendly, lo-fi-leaning rock bands. This cohort was best represented on the 2010 compilation PVI0006/IBB004, jointly released by artist-run labels Paradise Vendors and Italian Beach Babes. As that generic title implies, the scene was more about inter-band camaraderie than a specific sound-- more about sharing split releases and trading links than hiring publicists or branding themselves. So it's no shock that no movement ever came from it; in fact, a few of the bands don't even exist anymore. But others-- Male Bonding, Cold Pumas, Fair Ohs-- have gone on to make more substantial work on their own.At the head of that surviving class sits Mazes, thanks to the leap they've taken with their second album, Ores & Minerals. Its predecessor, 2011's A Thousand Heys, was a solid take on 90s American indie, but a bit too beholden to its influences. Ores & Minerals fixes that and adds a lot more. Singer/guitarist <name>Jack Cooper</name> claims he wanted to make a record ""that wasn't influenced by anything but influenced by everything,"" and his trio has achieved that seemingly paradoxical goal. You can still hear traces of other bands here, but Mazes' sound now is more an idiosyncratic hybrid than an enthusiastic photocopy.That's perhaps due to how the trio wrote their songs this time. Many began as loops rather than melodies, resulting in immediate hooks that gradually extend into something longer-lasting. The effect is clear from the very first track, ""Bodies"", which morphs from a simple indie pop tune into a hypnotic twin-guitar jam. It evokes similar journeys by Television and the Feelies, not in exact sound but in feel-- that is, in the way its seven minutes of blissful music would still be effective at twice the length.The template set by ""Bodies"" is furthered by the krautrocky title track and the mesmerizing ""Skulking"", which ramps into a crescendo of Velvet Underground-like fuzz. In between those expansive pieces lies a wealth of sonic variety. There's the slow sway of ""Dan Higgs Particle"", the proggy, Malkmus-esque lope of ""Sucker Punched"", and even an eerie piano piece called ""Leominster"". Mazes fuse those styles by sheer force of personality-- each tune bears their own thoughtful approach first and influences second.It also helps that <name>Cooper</name> keeps the words to a minimum. Many of his lyrics on A Thousand Heys comprised long sentences spooled out in a breathless, sometimes rambling rush. But here he sticks mostly to short phrases with lots of pauses in between. The tactic gives the album a haiku-ish feel, with <name>Cooper</name> exploring his subjects--- relationships, divorces, aging-- in terms that are openly universal rather than limitingly specific.There is one moment on Ores & Minerals that could be about something particular. Halfway through the title track, <name>Cooper</name> sings about ""looking in, looking out on a scene that's distorted/ Liking things, friend it, report it/ You're contorted."" Perhaps that's his take on what happened with the scene Mazes came from (something he expands upon in this interview), suggesting any attempt to summarize only distorted what it was really about. But it feels more like <name>Cooper</name>'s moved on, and on Ores & Minerals he's more interested in contorting his own sound than worrying about anyone else's."
8668	13392	"Over the past few years, the small Norwegian label Miasmah Records has been heroically doing its part to make the world a slightly darker, lonelier place with a steady stream of majestically bleak ambient classical releases, some inspired by the frozen polar climes.  Last year's Treny, by the Polish producer <name>Michal Jacaszek</name>, was a funereal wash of chamber strings and electronics, but it scans as harmlessly pretty next to Kreng's seriously nasty L'Autopsie Phénoménale De Dieu. The debut by the Belgian artist <name>Pepijn Caudron</name>, L'Autopsie is a harrowing bad trip of a record, a malevolent wisp of low drones, eerie, high whines, and disquieting found-sound samples. If that doesn't sound like quite the right soundtrack for your soul-wiltingly hot late August-- well, maybe keep it in mind for late February, when the ground is the same pallid color as the sky.  You'll need this sort of thing then.""Na De Sex"" opens the proceedings on a deceptively peaceful note, a piano tumbling its way down the only major scale you will hear for the rest of the album. Then, an ominous tritone-- bowed on one violin and plucked on another-- intrudes, and from that point forward, the lights shut off completely. Except for a mournful little gypsy violin figure that pops up briefly on ""Caliban,"" L'Autopsie dispenses completely with Treny's weeping string arrangements. The sonic landscape here is arid, even desolate: a single violin whispers a high harmonic; a muted trumpet bleats feebly; a brushed snare rasps like sandpaper. The instruments are separated by yawning caverns of blank space, and the effect is not dissimilar to a Webern miniature, where the silences grow so immense that you begin to be aware of your own heartbeat.To raise hackles higher, <name>Caudron</name> scatters a mix of deeply disturbing sound samples throughout, ranging from muffled screams and dialogue sampled from old horror movies (""Why don't you turn back into a cat?"" a man inquires at one point. ""I liked you better that way"") to rodent-like squeaking noises, to-- most upsetting of all-- the sound of a young woman sobbing quietly while <name>Chopin</name>'s mournful Prelude No. 20 in C minor plays in the foreground. On ""Slaapliedje"", children whisper horrible, ghostly sounds into your ear.  Wobbly old recordings of opera sopranos spin in a back room somewhere, furthering the creep factor.With such a haunted-house ambience, it takes awhile before you notice that <name>Caudron</name> actually uses a wide range of instrumentation on L'Autopsie, including cello, bassoon, and accordion.  He seems to operate on the principle, however, that if the instrument can't be shrunk down teeny-tiny and made to emulate a creaking door, then it goes out the window. There are some glowing piano passages that recall Satie, and some vaguely tribal bangs and clonks in the percussion that summon the spirit of <name>Harry Partch</name>, but mostly, L'Autopsie belongs to its own genre,  ready-made to soundtrack upcoming <name>David Lynch</name> films or avant-garde theater productions (not coincidentally, the surrealist theater troupe Abbatoir Fermé has used <name>Kreng</name>'s music for some of its productions). Hovering like a unshakeable doubt or a 3 a.m. bout of existential dread, L'Autopsie is brilliantly sinister mood music; put it on in the background and it will surely make whatever task you are engaged in at least 30% more evil."
3640	18658	"Regional funk and R&B compilations have been flooding the reissue market for ages now, and yet in all that time, it's taken until this year for even the deepest-digging reissue label in the business to get to the foundation of one of the most vital scenes in funk lore. The chart-topping, synth-heavy pulse that came out of the Twin Cities in the 80s still seems, even to most music fans short of the local veteran scenester, to be an abrupt fluke of auteurist proficiency and creativity, largely credited to the braintrusts of everything-man superstar Prince and the songwriting/production juggernaut of <name>Jimmy Jam Harris</name> and <name>Terry Lewis</name>. The groups these three names cut their chops with have been hinted at by music historians, and the peers they shared a scene with got some acknowledgment here and there. But little of this information has ever really been put into the wider context of what Minneapolis sounded like before the Minneapolis Sound. How could the scene that gave us 1999 and Control have such an underknown history where its pre-eighties R&B roots are concerned?Thanks to the deep knowledge base and research that went into Numero Group's Purple Snow compilation, it's made clear just why that is—and why, in a fairer world, it shouldn't have been the case. A large metro area split between the rival identies of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the Twin Cities had plenty of pitfalls for touring bands. It's a long drive to just about everywhere—more than 300 miles to Milwaukee, 400 to Chicago, and 700 to Cincinnati. Staying home, meanwhile, meant a relatively small support group to break bands on a wider scale before they had the buzz to go national. Booking for funk and R&B bands was constrained to a small circuit of clubs, including venues like the Nacirema and the Cozy Bar, that had vanished by the time First Avenue served as the setting for Purple Rain. There weren't any nationally-distributed, Minneapolis-based indie labels that supported the sound on the level of the garage-pop powerhouse of Soma in the 60s or the punk/new wave stronghold of Twin/Tone in the 80s. What few radio stations supported the format were low-wattage and under-the-radar, while the local press was more fixated on finding the next breakthrough folkie to emerge from the campus coffeehouse circuit like <name>Bob Dylan</name> a decade before.By now, that one <name>Chris Rock</name> joke might be coming to mind—that the only two black people in Minnesota are <name>Prince</name> and (the now late) <name>Kirby Puckett</name>. Which is hyperbole, of course, but not by much. Despite the presence of strong black communities in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul dating back generations, there was still enough of a widespread passive-aggressive animosity from forces outside the community that manifested as a cold shoulder to deeper integration. In 1978, the same year <name>Prince</name> released his debut album For You, Twins owner <name>Calvin Griffith</name> was caught stating that the reason he picked Minnesota as the destination city for the Washington Senators' 1961 relocation was because “we found out you only had 15,000 blacks here.” The music scene wasn't much easier—more than one musician in the liner notes to Purple Snow mentions that groups couldn't get booked unless there were at least a few white faces in the band. Between prejudice, lack of resources, and a geographically isolated and constrained locale, there was only one way a funk scene could thrive in the Twin Cities: people had to stick together and network, even as limited resources meant stiff competition.For the better part of the 70s, that meant a lot of woodshedding, experimentation, personnel crossover, community outreach, and evolution—but not a signature style. Most of the material on Purple Snow that dates from the early-mid 70s pre-synthesized, pre-disco funk era could come from just about anywhere, so long as that anywhere had a bunch of talented kids who dug <name>Curtis Mayfield</name> and <name>Isaac Hayes</name>. Many of them typically followed those artists' opulent musicianship, albeit with tighter budgets and dimmer spotlights. Haze, a St. Paul band who predated <name>Prince</name> by having some Purple in their identity until they figured the <name>Hendrix</name> estate wouldn't approve, recorded an excellent debut album in 1974. Two cuts from that self-titled LP—the minor-hit ballad “I Do Love My Lady” and the uptempo conga funk of “Waiting for the Moment”—emphasize the close harmonies, purring organ, and swirling, liquid wah-wah guitars that play up their psychedelic-soul bonafides. Prophets of Peace, who did everything they could to land gigs but saw their ambitions thwarted by the Cities' constraints, were a big horn-driven unit in the tradition of War or Mandrill; what the selection “Get On” lacks in deep messaging (“hey everybody, we wanna party/ all night long”) it makes up for in the kind of crowdpleasing tightness and groove that heated every undersized dancefloor it was pointed at.And then there's the Family—not to be confused with the mid-80s <name>Prince</name> offshoot of the same name that recorded “Nothing Compares 2 U” five years before <name>Sinead</name> did. A tight-knit crew of musicians who changed their name from Black Magic after some interloping Chicagoans (and, more damagingly, the media) mistook their community center homebase for a turf-war locale, the Family—here billed as Music, Love & Funk—contribute a sweaty yet sophisticated Ohio Players-caliber seven-plus-minute jam called “Stone Lover”, recorded in 1976. By then, <name>Spike Moss</name> and the neighborhood resource that was The Way community center had become a nexus for North Minneapolis youth to hone their playing, and the opportunity to record at the legendary Sound 80 studios of Blood on the Tracks fame drew in a grip of local musicians to join the chorus.One of the voices to jump in on that cut was one <name>Prince Nelson</name>, then a teenager on the verge of dropping his last name as he got his session-rat studies in at <name>Chris Moon</name>'s busy Moonsound Studios. And if there's one thing that Purple Snow makes clear, it's that <name>Prince</name> was practically everywhere in the scene during the late 70s, a prodigial player who learned from everybody and subsequently lent his credits to groups like the Lewis Connection (background vocals and guitar on the silky slow jam “Got to Be Something Here”) and 94 East (the pool-party smoothness of “If You See Me"", where his taut chicken-scratch lead guitar riff barely reveals the virtuoso lurking beneath the hired-hand pro). It's a bit odd to hear him primarily in the context of just another piece of a bigger puzzle, even if his burgeoning talent is attested to frequently in the album's liner notes. (A Minnesota Daily quote, inspired by observations of him at work at Moonsound: “He's got his program pretty well worked out and the wheels are in motion... it's only a matter of time.”) But it goes a long way towards explaining just how and why he managed to dominate the Minneapolis scene: not merely with outrageous style, crossover aspirations, or courting controversy, but by working his ass off.The only artists to rival Prince's proficiency at the time were, of course, <name>Jimmy Harris</name> and <name>Terry Lewis</name>. As inseparable as their identities have become, Purple Snow makes a point of outlining how divergent their parallel paths really were before they joined forces at the turn of the 80s. <name>Harris</name> put drumming first—he did gigs with his father, <name>“Cornbread” Harris</name>, in a jazz trio before he hit his teens. Then he auditioned for a band at age 13 and found himself outclassed behind the kit, so he joined as a keyboard player instead and cut his teeth on an electric piano borrowed from his dad. By high school, Harris' ear for Philly soul and knack for songwriting led him to become the keyboardist, writer and arranger for a group called Mind & Matter. That band's material here is commercial-friendly to a point—Lewis's Gamble/Huff nods are savvy, and catchy as all get-out—but with the circa-1977 equipment at his fingertips, <name>Lewis</name>' budget-minded substitution of synthesizers for string sections is a bit prescient. Sadly, not prescient enough to find an audience—though they more than held their own in warmup gigs for disco-soul bands like Pleasure and Brass Construction.<name>Terry Lewis</name> was clued in to <name>Harris</name>'s talent, but wasn't able to recruit him into the own thing he had going for a while: a Funkadelic-inspired band intially known as Wars of Armageddon before they changed their name to the less-apocalyptic, <name>Donald Byrd</name>-inspired Flyte Tyme. (The photo of this band in full Mothership-stowaway regalia is worth the price of the collection alone.) Flyte Tyme were more defiantly funky than some of the smooth-soul bands they shared the city with, and powerhouse enough to reportedly upstage <name>Prince</name> when he played his first hometown headlining gig at Minneapolis' Capri Theater in February 1979. In the songs included here from a 1979 Flyte Tyme session—“It's the Things That You Do” and “I've Got You on My Mind”—there's a polished yet gutsy momentum that pairs slap bass and synthesizers to evocative (and scene-definingly familiar) effect. Fatefully, one of the band's most crucial components at the time was singer <name>Cynthia Johnson</name>, who boasted the kind of outer-space glamour and Chaka Khan chops that could've made Flyte Tyme huge. But in jumping ship from Flyte Tyme to record the vocals for Lipps. Inc's “Funkytown”—one of the first hits for the Minneapolis Sound and one of the last of the disco era—another identity change for the band was necessary. As fate would have it, <name>Harris</name>'s gig with Mind & Matter wasn't panning out, and the side work he was getting in the studio— including playing all the synthesized instruments and drums on <name>Michael A. Dixon</name> & J.O.Y.'s 1980 electro-gospel curiosity “You're All I Need”—wasn't enough. So the man his DJ gig christened <name>Jimmy Jam</name> became Flyte Tyme's second keyboardist. The Flyte was eventually grounded, leaving them as the Time.With those enduring luminaries at work, it's still worth acknowledging some of the groups that either fell through the cracks or found minor stardom on a modest scale. While the Minneapolis sound comes across on the surface like an e pluribus unum nucleus where everyone eventually benefited from the stratospheric rise of a few, the expectations and associations of being in with Prince and company could wear an artist down. Some defied it, like the velvety quiet storm stylings of <name>Rockie Robbins</name> (“Together”) or the straightforward disco-flavored groove of Band of Thieves veteran guitarist <name>Orville Shannon</name> (“One Life to Live”). Others were drawn into the inner circle, only to be steered towards something they didn't quite fit, like <name>Sue Ann Carwell</name>, a self-proclaimed “little ghetto chick just hanging around town” whose tenuous <name>Prince</name> connections led to a Warner Bros. contract. Her self-titled 1981 debut, produced by <name>Pete Bellotte</name> in a half-assed compromise between Minneapolis and Italo-disco, bricked big-time, while a truer-to-the-style 1982 track, “Should I Or Should I Not"", was shopped around A&Rs to no avail. And while the early works of the more familiar names here are intriguing, there's the feeling that they should've led to more than just famous affiliations. <name>Alexander O'Neal</name>, the charismatic, rangy-voiced post-Johnson frontman for Flyte Tyme until <name>Morris Day</name> replaced him, would notch a string of hits that early indie cuts like the squiggly get-down jams “Borrowed Time” and “Do You Dare” promisingly anticipated while proving that his success as a performer wasn't entirely dependent on <name>Jam</name>/<name>Lewis</name>. And <name>Andre Cymone</name>'s minimalist, funky synthpop/new wave concoction “Somebody Said” makes it worth noting that his career encompassed far more than being one of <name>Prince</name>'s longest cohorts and playing bass for the Revolution, even if that's how his mid-80s solo albums were pigeonholed.Then again, few shadows were harder to escape than the one of Minnesota itself. Longtime residents and scenesters might flip through the booklet of Purple Snow and note the way these artists positioned themselves among local landmarks—Prophets of Peace lined up among the lavish foliage of the Como Park Conservatory; 94 East lounging in the shadows of <name>Charles Ginnever</name>'s jagged modernist sculpture 'Nautilus' outside the Walker Art Center; Mind & Matter raising disco fingers to the sky perched atop the mushroom-like brutalist platforms of Peavey Plaza. The musicians position themselves like they're unusual presences in these Twin Cities landmarks, even though they're established local artists. Maybe they felt out of place, crowded out, even unwelcome. And whether the emergence of the Minneapolis Sound in the 80s changed all that is still somewhat uncertain; alt-country and bluegrass acts currently overwhelm up-and-coming R&B and hip-hop artists in sheer number and opportunity. But the precedent that Purple Snow traces led to something special: a situation where a core of artists were given an inch and wound up taking a mile—not out of greed, but of necessity."

    blurred as the song progresses, the only constant amid the cacophony being <name>Morgan</name>'s buried yelps of ""woo-hoo"" and ""ah-ah"" that eventually collide in a gigantic screech
    signaling the conclusion of the disc's preface.  ""Infinity of Stops"" picks up directly thereafter, as the static pulse is refurbished with a clipping beat courtesy
    of drummer <name>John Lockie</name> and some squealing guitar manipulations that are similarly hacked to bits by the underlying bass line.  This too inescapably falls victim to the
    approaching fallout of the bare percussion, a reluctant follower of the chaos that recently cleared the path for its creation and release.
    Given the pummeling offensive the band tends to rely on, it's unexpected that Sightings outfit multiple tracks with what sounds like the sophisticated gamelan-influenced
    playing style of the Indonesian Isles.  Perhaps as a move to admonish comments regarding the band as a second rate Boredoms or Pussy Galore-- or perhaps as
    sheer coincidence-- ""Bishops"" begins with a tangible and lasting beat, in itself a shock coming from the No New York-influenced band, that eventually waylays an example
    of such an Eastern-tinged rhythm into the high end of the mix.  As <name>Morgan</name> continues to do his best <name>John Lydon</name> impression, uttering nonsensical phrases and monosyllabic
    sounds, the Javanese-esque melody eventually fades to echo only to reappear transformed in the following track, ""Canadian Money"".  Syncopating from within the belly
    of a steel factory, the metal drums rule the track as a rapid-fire attack of humming and pounding fight and win the battle to keep above the current of rising guitar fallouts
    and steady bass-drones.
    Further rallying against cries of homogeneity in a field of Rock 'N Roll where such accusations are rampant and unpleasantly expected, Sightings does not rest in
    presenting a bevy of tracks that display their knack for subtle interplay.  Possibly an inverted political message,
    ""Right Side of the Hall"" is a D.C.-hardcore tune at heart, with vocals channeled as an animal growl and a pop-rhythm section so simple and catchy, it would be a crime to
    bury it beneath all of that feedback-- if in the end it wasn't such a beautiful statement of artistic freedom to do so.  ""E.E."" is further evidence of the group's pop mastery, as
    the track exemplifies in forty-five seconds what Man...or Astroman? have been attempting to accomplish for the past four years-- an <name>Elvis Presley</name> beach-song
    characteristically played by the heavy machinery of a high-rise construction crew.
    The track exists in stark contrast to the veritable jam sessions of ""Anna Mae Wong"" and ""Reduction"", both of which surpass the seven-minute mark during the unraveling of
    their respective sound.  In the former, the group uses the moments between starts and stops to develop a suspenseful tension that eventually becomes a pattern of
    instrumental call-and-response bringing to mind comparisons with the early improvisation of jazz and the blues.  The latter track further builds upon this, but instead of a
    silent backdrop for the voices to argue against ""Reduction"" provides a sobering cadence, a beat that sputters out modestly in a manner befitting a composition that is showy
    only in its lack of pretense.
    A difficult album to take in, one should not disregard Absolutes based on a single listen, or even three or four.  Like the outline diagrammed on the cover for the production
    of sweet-corn hooch, the rewards of the disc increase exponentially with repeated listens and time.  Not the sound of something new, but merely the sound of something
    done right, Sightings has hit upon an extraordinary groove, one they will hopefully ride out to its pure and uncomplicated end."
7244	14821	"In his 2004 memoir, Chronicles, Volume One, <name>Bob Dylan</name> writes of encountering <name>Mike Seeger</name> in the early 1960s in Greenwich Village, and being left spellbound by the effortless mastery the folk legend exhibited in his interpretations of a dizzying array of traditional American song forms. ""He played these songs as good as it was possible to play them,"" <name>Dylan</name> writes, adding that, ""What I had to work at, <name>Mike</name> already had in his genes, in his genetic makeup... The thought occurred to me that maybe I'd have to write my own folk songs.""The 47 songs collected on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 allow us to witness how <name>Dylan</name> went about doing just that. Representing the fruits of his first two publishing contracts (with Leeds Music and with <name>M. Witmark</name> & Sons), the set reveals a much subtler and more fascinating journey than the popular shorthand myth of <name>Dylan</name>'s shifting cleanly from folk apprentice to political firebrand to poetic rock'n'roller. For starters, a great many of the songs to which <name>Dylan</name> first affixed his name as writer were simply his own original lyrics atop traditional folk melodies. Not all of these words excoriated social injustice either-- far from it. Even from the beginning, there were love songs and outlaw songs, moodily poetic songs and broad jokes. Still, The Witmark Demos does demonstrate an evolution in songwriting genius, and one that took place in a frighteningly short period of a time by a young man who'd yet to turn 24 when the last of these recordings were made. On this set, you can hear <name>Dylan</name> moving past the bedrock melodies of folk and crafting indelible ones of his own (""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right""). You can hear him perfecting the protest song (""Blowin' in the Wind"", ""Masters of War""). And you can hear him falling in love with the music of words and beginning to invent a new vocabulary for pop music (a scratchy, nascent piano-only take of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"").Only 15 of the set's 47 songs are unheard in any incarnation on a previous <name>Dylan</name> release (more on them later). The other 32 are split fairly evenly between germinal takes on songs from early-60s <name>Dylan</name> albums and alternate rough cuts of tunes that appear in equally embryonic states on the first Bootleg Series issue, 1991's Volumes 1-3. You might think auxiliary efforts would be of interest only to <name>Dylan</name> obsessives-- and in some cases these readings scarcely differ from others in his catalogue. Still, there are revelations: The oft-covered ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" has appeared previously only in live form on <name>Dylan</name>'s second greatest hits compilation, and the version here is far richer, the guitar playing lovely and sublime. The classic protest song ""Oxford Town"" may be less immaculate here, but it's more bracing and insistent. The readings of ""Mama, You've Been on My Mind"" and ""I'll Keep It with Mine"" are especially pained and plaintive, while the bitingly satirical ""Talkin' <name>John Birch</name> Paranoid Blues"" and ""Rambling, Gambling Willie"" are looser and more ebullient here than anywhere else they've appeared before.As for the 15 ""new"" songs, a few are mere fragments and a few others are fairly boilerplate, but again there are real treasures. ""Farewell"" haunts with its melody while ""The Death of <name>Emmett Till</name>"" haunts with its words, yet both are outshone by the bitterly ironic tour de force ""Long Ago, Far Away"", where <name>Dylan</name> enumerates social injustices ostensibly relegated to the distant past that were in fact still occuring in his own time, witheringly spitting the refrain, ""Those things don't happen no more nowadays."" ""I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day"" and ""All Over You"" further display comic sides, and then there's ""Long Time Gone"", which shows us an initial flowering of the unflappably cool mythical icon <name>Dylan</name> would fully become in the mid-60s. The song's refrain offers a perfect summation of how this set reveals the historical depth of <name>Dylan</name>'s musical education as well as the lengths to which he would eclipse it. ""I'm a long time a-comin',"" <name>Dylan</name> sings, ""and I'll be a long time gone."""
201	22547	<name>Joe Budden</name> has defined himself as an intensely emotional tough guy who has never stopped putting everything out there, but the New Jersey rapper’s best music has frequently cut inward. Throughout his Mood Muzik mixtape-series-turned-brand, <name>Budden</name> has picked at and peeled away his depression, addiction, and the many embarrassments he’s collected as an eager public figure. When he’s down, he opens up. In many ways <name>Budden</name> is an under-acknowledged trailblazer of hip-hop’s 21st century relationship with the Internet, ahead of his time in living for and through the web as much as alongside it. He nurtured his online fans before it was an obvious play, earning and grooming a cult following of lyric-obsessed hip-hop heads, some of whom prize his legitimate emo leanings, and some who just love bars.On his new album, Rage & the Machine, <name>Budden</name>’s music is less moody but as densely lyrical as ever. His raps have long leaned on the preferred devices of the competitive lyricism he exemplifies: puns, metaphors, clever topicality. “I used to drive around the tunnel in a Lexus with a snub/Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club,” he raps on “Uncle <name>Joe</name>,” a track that plays on his preferred trope of bitter contempt for the current state of hip-hop.The record is produced almost entirely by the Providence beatmaker AraabMUZIK, a 27-year-old whose pyrotechnic pad-smashing earned him viral YouTube fame as an MPC whiz. AraabMUZIK, whose given name is <name>Abraham Orellana</name>, has been generously collaborative and experimental, producing for the Diplomats and many others in a meandering career. Unfortunately, Rage & the Machine skips over <name>Orellana</name>’s most interesting inclinations—forward-looking fusions of electronic, dance, and street hip-hop—in favor of his most traditional ones, an unfortunate fit for <name>Budden</name>’s reductionist New York rap nostalgia.AraabMUZIK isn’t the type to dwell on a beat, and has established a formula of programming drums that is both finicky and mechanical. On a song like “Flex,” a conspicuous lead single that features Fabolous and <name>Tory Lanez</name>, he piles drum sounds onto each other expertly before haphazardly triggering a sample atop. With a breathless, high-word-count approach to lyricism, <name>Budden</name> benefits from the boxed-in nature of AraabMUZIK percussion, which give him a wall to push against. “Forget” is one of the best bits of matchmaking, a short, verse-only ramble on a boom bap 2.0 beat that lets both artists play to their talents. “I Gotta Ask” is a committed <name>Jay Z</name> homage; instead of an <name>Annie</name> number, !llmind flips a <name>Sondheim</name> stage song into similarly whimsical territory. <name>Budden</name> adopts <name>Jay</name>’s cadence to run down his preferred list of boasts and persistent complaints. Elsewhere, some songs arrive a little late to the party in borrowed clothes. “I Wanna Know” samples a Manhattans loop which was also the thrust of a standout Madlib beat on <name>Freddie Gibbs</name>’ 2014 breakout album Pinata. Sample recycling might not be the faux pas it once was in hip-hop—Madlib himself wasn’t the first to pull this record—but AraabMUZIK’s simple chop and pitch-up make it feel like a blatant beatjack. On a separate song, a separate infraction: “Time for Work” has a hook sung by <name>Emanny</name> that he must have written while listening to <name>Jeremih</name>’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em,” because the melody is all but the same. More generally, <name>Budden</name> has struggled with making catchy songs and this album carries a couple clunkers with gawky hooks. To the rapper’s credit, Rage & the Machine is one of his more accessible records, less emotionally insular than usual, but perhaps a little cold for that reason. It’s not a redesign as much as a measured refinement. There’s a fan service aspect to Budden’s music by now that hinges on his fixed audience. “What you expecting from me?/Why else you checking for me?,” the singer <name>Jazzy</name> wonders on a track called “By Law.” If you’re listening to a <name>Joe Budden</name> album in 2016, you probably already know what you’re in for.
