9608	12359	"If the Dears sound a little deflated on this, their fourth full-length offering, they certainly have that right. The creation of Missiles coincided with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) <name>Murray Lightburn</name> and <name>Natalia Yanchak</name> have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by <name>Mark E. Smith</name>. What's more, Missiles marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- Silverlake, California-based Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with Bella Union abroad and, in these parts, Arts & Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. Given all this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over.""Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. It's not without its snags-- we'll get to those-- but Missiles is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record about coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a repeated invitation to ""Come back.""Musically, the Dears stay on point on Missiles. They've long excelled at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has since become adjectival shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of cinema feels more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off No Cities Left) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over?This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. Missiles is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", <name>Lightburn</name> sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on Missiles is, simply put, inviting. That's seldom more evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them.On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, Missiles is hampered to a significant degree by a number of full-on WTF lyrical moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult subject of racism, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when <name>Lightburn</name> describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", <name>Lightburn</name> declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is awkwardly shoehorned in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 & 2"") ""It's a suicide mission that has us by the balls."" Youch.These ill-advised lyrical moments can be perplexing and occasionally frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the Dears' music, but in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an earnestness decidedly lacking in today's indie landscape. It may be that <name>Lightburn</name> values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his songwriting, even if that means the occasional cliché or corny conversational turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, overall even these lyrical shortcomings make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something <name>Lightburn</name> seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight."
8001	14032	"A state-of-the-state album, Dear Companion finds three musicians focusing on the ecological challenges facing of old Kentucky home. Between them, they represent a range of the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native <name>Ben Sollee</name> plays cello in a style that borrows from Appalachian techniques, <name>Daniel Martin Moore</name> of Cold Spring is a solo folk artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer <name>Yim Yames</name> sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. On their first record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called mountaintop removal mining, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. Dear Companion examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is disappearing-- both literally (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped).So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. Dear Companion generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. Rather than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own fears and hopes, especially as they bear on subsequent generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers.Fine singers all, <name>Sollee</name>, <name>Moore</name>, and <name>Yames</name> wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, <name>Moore</name> and especially <name>Sollee</name> draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. <name>Sollee</name>'s cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""It Won't Be Long"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and <name>Moore</name> play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians."
9756	12208	"As the premier alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo, the Dresden Dolls have a lot working in their favor-- foremost a virtual lock on the alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo market. Duty-bound to fly that particularly lonely flag, the group's tour schedule has been relentless, its theatrical flourishes exhausting. Yet even though the Dolls paint from a deceptively diverse pallet, it's not surprising that <name>Amanda Palmer</name>, the group's focus and primary creative force, should start to maybe feel a little stifled and set out on her own, at least for the time being. Certainly <name>Palmer</name> and drummer <name>Brian Viglione</name> could have released whatever they wanted and called it the Dresden Dolls. The fact that <name>Palmer</name> didn't suggests she recognized a certain stylistic sanctity to the Dolls sound. To that end, Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> began as a solo outing in the truest sense, with just <name>Palmer</name> and her piano at the fore and the recording process itself fast and unfussy. Then fan, friend, and fellow piano-pounder <name>Ben Folds</name> entered the picture as producer and general jack-of-all-trades, and quickly the project and <name>Palmer</name>'s musical purview expanded. On opener ""Astronaut"" it's easy to hear how it might have begun as just <name>Palmer</name> alone before a bevy of embellishments pushed it toward the borderline symphonic. The song's dynamic, dramatic, and every bit as hyper-stylized as the Dresden Dolls, and hooky as hell despite the clutter of the arrangement, which offers grunts, guitars, synths, and tons of vocal ticks among its tricks. The breathless ""Runs in the Family"" follows a similar tack as <name>Palmer</name> goes, literally, nuts: ""Me? Well, I'm well. Well, I mean I'm in hell. Well, I still have my health (at least that's what they tell me),"" she sings as she rushes through a litany of lyrical lunacy. With ""Ampersand"", we finally hit a track that might have been out of place on a Dolls disc, just <name>Palmer</name> and her piano (plus some strings, arranged by the legendary <name>Paul Buckmaster</name>) playing a ballad. ""I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand,"" she sings, ""And even if I went with you, I'm not the girl you think I am."" While it seems Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> sets out to tell a story (it's even divided into two acts), and the song itself could work as a rallying cry of independence from within any smothering relationship, the confession could also serve as a sign of frustration at being stuck with the Dolls.In truth Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> spans a decade of songwriting, and by ""Leeds United"" the disc has revealed itself as a broad collection of rich character studies born of <name>Palmer</name>'s lyrical acuity, likely laced with personal touches that nudge some of the material toward the at least loosely autobiographical. In the track, blasts of horn (courtesy the awesomely named Born Again Horny Men of Edinburgh) punctuate <name>Palmer</name>'s own hoarse, histrionic shouts as her protagonist drowns herself in booze, pop culture, and shopping. In the somber ""Blake Says"", the titular <name>Blake</name> (following in the footsteps of <name>Lou Reed</name> muses <name>Stephanie</name> and <name>Caroline</name>) struggles with depression and loneliness, ultimately choosing isolation (and maybe death?) rather than bear the weight of the world. Similar themes course through the school-shooting chronicle ""Strength Through Music"" (reportedly written after Columbine but recorded the week of the Virginia Tech shooting) and ""Guitar Hero"" (which features the Dead Kennedys' East Bay Ray in a tale of someone choosing fantasy over reality), a return to rambunctious, theatrical rock. The subtly apocalyptic ""Have to Drive"" is about that most primordial of rock themes, escape (replete with operatic men's choir, and delivered with particularly literary bent). ""What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"" (from <name>Rodgers</name> and <name>Hammerstein</name>'s ""Carousel"", and featuring St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>) underscores that musical's creepy undercurrent of submission and supernatural sublimation, and therefore fits right in. Too bad its creepy power is undercut by the blithe, bubblegum, mostly obnoxious ""Oasis"", a rape and abortion ditty-- ha!-- that gives irony a bad name. (In her defense, <name>Palmer</name> once considered the track ""too silly,"" but <name>Folds</name> convinced her to include it-- he should have known better, since his own abortion hit ""Brick"" was a lot more effective and affecting.) Fortunately it's followed by another powerful, riveting portrait, ""The Point of It All"", which once again emphasizes <name>Palmer</name>'s strengths as a lyricist, while ""Another Year"", with its distant echoes of ""Nightswimming"", manages to be a touching song of unrequited love and to namedrop <name>Bill Hicks</name>. Both of these tracks emphasize why <name>Palmer</name> may have wanted to go it alone. It's not that they would have been lost in the Dresden Dolls, but casting them in a separate spotlight does make them easier to locate, and maybe find new listeners as well."
682	21884	At the turn of the decade, the youthful dream of Copenhagen’s punk scene probably scared the shit out of most adults. Iceage, Lust For Youth, VÅR and Lower were barely out of their teens and gaining international attention with abrasive, often violent music and bloody shows that were a throwback to a time before punk broke (right down to the unfortunate taste in iconography). Five years later, those bands have become elder statesmen, playing festivals, starting experimental side projects and shifting towards more refined sounds. Hailing from Denmark’s “second city” of Aarhus, the appropriately named Yung aspires to lead the new brigade. However, their youthful dream is more sonically and emotionally conventional: they want to love and to be loved.A Youthful Dream is literal post-punk for <name>Mikkel Holm Silkjær</name>. He spent his teen years in hardcore bands with names like Urban Achievers, in part to piss off his father, who also happened to be a musician. In the short time since their 2015 Alter and These Thoughts are Like Mandatory Chores EPs, Yung have added pianos and horns and harmonies, the sort of thing most of their peers needed two albums to start embracing: the droning, metronomic “A Black Incident” could pass for a Lost in the Dream cover, while Yung tap into shuffling Britpop for “Morning View.” These moments add dimension and depth to the frigid, metallic production, which makes Yung often sound like they’re trying to generate warmth in a meat locker.  At least sonically, Yung has embraced beer-fueled, sanctified American fuck-ups like <name>Paul Westerberg</name> and <name>Jay Reatard</name>. <name>Silkjær</name>’s anti-authoritative streak isn’t quite as nihilistic and self-centered, however. Mostly, A Youthful Dream rails against the way “they” prevent “you” from getting what you need to get by. <name>Silkjær</name> longs to help a depressed friend on early highlight “Uncombed Hair,” but sees this situation as indicative of societal ills; he offers the kids a “stiff upper lip” pep talk on “A Black Incident” (“don’t cry out for help, they’ll say you’re weak”), worries they will get stuck in arrested development (“The Child”) with pharmaceutical control the only hope (“Pills”). So, maybe America and Denmark aren't all that different.Yung’s passion is never in question throughout A Youthful Dream; but at times, it’s all they’ve got. When <name>Silkjær</name> traces his vocals over the lead guitars, it’s enough to make “Uncombed Hair” and “Pills” stick. Otherwise, A Youthful Dream can only push through its weaker melodies and reverb through self-will. Taken together, Yung’s expanse and Silkjær’s yearning, belting vocals can actually evoke the early version of U2 that was considered post-punk. There is a messianic streak in <name>Silkjær</name>’s quest to save the youth from themselves and his distrust of whatever constitutes selling out (“Commercial”). Perhaps he’s only beginning to realize it: “I’m not quite sure if I am blessed,” he belts on “Mortal Sin”, and the important part is that he’s not quite sure. (Maybe he's somewhat sure.) And you can sense his increased willingness to dream big when he later sees himself as part of, “Two precious souls leaning against the idea of being in love”. For an anti-romantic punk band, it might as well be “two hearts beat as one!!!”
5076	17056	"When the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion returned to the stage two years ago after a six-year layoff, their mission was philosophically simple, if physically demanding: They just had to live up to their reputation as the perpetually sweat-soaked band that showed the 90s American indie underground how to get down. And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up positive notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman <name>Jon Spencer</name>, guitarist </name>Judah Bauer<name>, and drummer <name>Russell Simins</name> still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's Acme, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's Plastic Fang saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's Damage reverted back to the Acme game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator, Chuck D), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them Black Keys bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <name>Ty Segall</name> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to Shaft-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary R&B?With Meat and Bone, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: The Blues Explosion barrel through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. Stripped of the cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced Meat and Bone boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-Acme history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of Plastic Fang was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of Extra Width?If anything's really changed here, it's that <name>Spencer</name> sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by <name>Spencer</name>'s penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with Meat and Bone, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and <name>Spencer</name>'s banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, <name>Spencer</name>'s shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But <name>Spencer</name> understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on Meat and Bone, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the Orange-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, Meat and Bone gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which <name>Spencer</name> seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes Meat and Bone a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  "
4480	17754	"Kompakt opened as a record store in Cologne in 1993 and has been expanding its scope and reach since. If you're the type of person who owns only a handful of electronic albums, smart money says a Kompakt release is among them. And if you're the kind of person who owns dozens of electronic albums, Kompakt likely still commands serious shelf space. 20 Jahre Kompakt / Kollektion 1, which begins a year-long celebration of the label in its 20th year, spreads label standouts over two discs and serves as a reminder that the label's range vastly exceeds its reputation.And perhaps you do need reminding: Kompakt is hardly the tour-de-force it once was. After owning the better part of last decade with its light melodic touch and tasteful beatsmithing, the label was elbowed out of the spotlight by the harsher sounds coming from Berlin's resurgent club culture and London's fervent bass scene. These shifts threw into relief Kompakt's reputation as purveyors of gentle, polite techno more suited to dinner parties than dance floors.This reputation is only partly deserved. Kompakt rose to prominence as European club culture wound down from its 90s bacchanal; some of these ravers presumably traded all-night-in-a-field parties for graphic design and advertising jobs. If Kompakt was lifestyle music, it was serving the first generation of techno fans for which the sounds represented something other than a counterculture. The label's sound-- often referred to as ""minimal techno,"" though frequently no more than one of those terms applied-- left room for sweet, melancholy vocal tracks and helped it find an audience with indie rock fans looking to dig deeper into the sounds that inspired acts such as the Postal Service, the Notwist, and Caribou.20 Jahre Kompakt helps both the label and its fans sort through its history. It's not a greatest hits package, but a reflection of the catalog as the Kompakt principals would like to remember it-- some combination of hits and sentimental favorites. It's a smart strategy. The attitude throughout is warm and generous-- this aspect of the label's reputation is deserved-- but the tracks themselves are pliable and lightly funky. 20 Jahre is easy enough listening at low volumes, but crank the dial to reveal gamey basslines and sturdy leads. Suggesting that this music is only for home listening is to listen only through laptop speakers-- a trend that also coincided with Kompakt's heyday. The label's ""schaffel"" (""shuffle"") sound-- predicated on swung triplets (here's an example)-- ensures a playful bounce. (An aside: the label's two Schaffelfieber compilations are ripe for rediscovery.)The first track, Heiko Voss' ""I Think About You"", plays to expectations, coming off like the Sea and Cake covering Prince. So it's probably not an accident that the second, DJ Koze's remix of <name>Matias Aguayo</name>'s ""Minimal"", is a relatively recent smash that mocks the label's buzzword status. ""These clubbers don't dance...'Cause that music got no groove, no balls,"" croons <name>Aguayo</name>, calling back and forth with a cooing female voice. The classic motorik groove of the Field's ""Over the Ice"" sits alongside the glossy sentimentalism of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"". <name>Dettinger</name>'s ""Totentanz"" could almost slide in alongside the pitch-black acid techno coming out of the UK these days. Most of the big names-- <name>Gui Boratto</name>, <name>Wolfgang Voigt</name>, <name>Michael Mayer</name>-- are present, but their tracks here are curveballs. Skipping <name>Jürgen Paape</name>'s deeply loved ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"", for example, in favor of <name>Justus Köhncke</name>'s underrated ""2 After 909"" helps breathe life into yet another anniversary compilation.There was another reason, it must be mentioned, that Kompakt was so successful: its accessibility and willingness to compile itself. Their commitment to the CD format and their excellent distribution made and make their releases easy to acquire. Annual volumes of the Total and Pop Ambient series once served as milestones, though they test patience these days. Kompakt 100, a remix album celebrating the label's 100th release, dropped more than nine years ago. One of the label's best-ever offerings-- co-owner <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s seminal Immer-- is itself a mix that sums up the label's sound. There are now three volumes of it.None of the material on 20 Jahre is difficult to find, and early efforts like Total 2 and Total 3, as well as Immer, stand as better, if less comprehensive, documents of Kompakt's sound. But for anyone new to this friendly, versatile music, 20 Jahre is a smart, manageable introduction that doesn't give away the farm."
14675	11807	"Many consider the Pixies the Platonic ideal of a certain hardcore-pop style, of which copious transitory
    doppelgangers are merely cast shadows.  But for every gross of mediocre Pixies imitators, there's a band
    that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that
    these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and
    admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people.

    All art is some permutation of, or comment upon, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is
    that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know.
    The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the
    Pixies' style.  And we probably wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded
    screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies
    laid by assimilating their own influences into a unique style.

    San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, From Gutter w/Love,
    with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass
    and drums.  The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed
    Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, crisp shifts
    in volume and intensity, growling guitars that feint and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody
    sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and
    mutating uncontrollably.

    ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer <name>Valerie Iwamasa</name>'s dulcet upper-register through a
    flurry of spacious, contrapuntal guitar arpeggios and dense segments of puissant thrash.  The staid
    ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, cyclical guitar figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle
    of chugging, staccato <name>Kim Dealisms</name>, followed by the propulsive, <name>Surfer Rosa</name>-ish anthem ""Down"".  The
    triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the woozy string bends of ""Fallout"" are akin to The
    Wrens' haywire, seasick pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is riddled with prolix, rapid-fire
    ranting that complements the euphonious pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record.

    Truly new ideas are rare.  New combinations of old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality.  When
    one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk.  But when a band sounds like a hybrid
    of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like
    themselves.  If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough
    minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a
    new band that has imbibed their aesthetic.  It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a
    cannibal.  Dig in. "
17523	3718	"Last year's self-titled record from Halifax Pier delivered melancholy to all who
    would listen, with a violinist and a cellist added to the standard rock quartet
    of two guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental
    duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in
    the musical conversations of the music.

    While Halifax Pier hasn't completely rid themselves of their despair, they seem
    to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore
    full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the
    songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in
    contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999
    self-titled debut.

    ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat
    in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are
    self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The
    rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an
    all-together-now sing-along taken from a <name>Chris Williamson</name> song, ""Song of the
    Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.

    ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a
    distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for
    each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of <name>Greg Burns</name> are
    eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,
    the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from
    Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,
    in which frontman <name>Charles Sommer</name>'s vocals are echoed by guest <name>Colleen Doyle</name>:
    ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""

    ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with
    a meandering conversation between the cello and violin. The drum and light
    electric guitar enter to reveal a dark waltz. The euphonious harmonic ornaments
    of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than
    grizzly.

    Then there's ""Sew Your Gloves On,"" which features sections in seven.  The
    track is slightly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more
    coherent moments, when they're not so damned consumed with the collapse of
    modern society. And finally, the album closes with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering
    track that feels closer to something from the Windham Hill collection than
    anything remotely indie rock.

    So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally
    consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does
    make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice."
5509	16588	"The voice of Swans frontman and founder <name>Michael Gira</name> is one of stentorian command. Even during the lightest moments of his three-decade career, <name>Gira</name>'s bellow has been deep, dark, and direct, both an apt vehicle for his raw lines about spiritual tumult and human filth and a compelling accompaniment to Swans' stylized roil. But at least on We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head, the new live double-disc set from his rebuilt old band, <name>Gira</name> sounds exhausted. That Pentecostal bark has weathered into a battered bleat. At the start of ""Eden Prison"", for instance, <name>Gira</name>'s voice shakes and breaks, barely shaping the syllables into their proper forms. ""Within the walls of Eden Prison,"" he opens, struggling to climb over the relative quiet of drifting guitar and a twinkling vibraphone, ""there is a mark upon our stone."" We Rose comes culled from Swans' first tour in more than a decade, an intercalary period in which <name>Gira</name> introduced the world to Devendra Banhart and Akron/Family, played solo acoustic shows, and led the comparatively mild-mannered Angels of Light. Pushing 60, maybe he just doesn't have the requisite stamina to lead Swans, a band once so loud and dangerous they made fans vomit.But sit tight. The 100 minutes of music that precede ""Eden Prison"" on We Rose make for an exhaustive listen, with 15-minute sprawls of suffocating noise, drums that suggest a fleet of fists to the face and loads of shouts about praising God, committing infanticide, and welcoming slavery. It's the kind of hyper-brutal album that requires an intermission or, at the very least, a long hard look at a plain white wall when its two hours have ended. Though We Rose pulls from gigs in Melbourne, Berlin, and New York City, this collection offers a mostly accurate recapitulation of the 102 sets that this iteration of Swans played since the 2010 release of My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, the band's first album in 13 years. Loud, mean, and complicated, this six-piece is an articulate goliath, capable of drowning out <name>Gira</name> in waves before disappearing into pools of silence without warning. Each piece of this unit deserves mention: The finesse of <name>Norman Westberg</name>'s guitar playing offers the perfect foil for <name>Gira</name>'s general force. <name>Christopher Pravdica</name>'s bass snaps as much as it throbs, while <name>Christoph Hahn</name> uses his double-lap steel guitar not as a country-music accent mark but as an origin of general abrasion. Drummer <name>Phil Puleo</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Thor Harris</name> often double the rhythm, giving that old Swans stomp bigger feet. This band is at once visceral and subtle, reverent with the source but relentless with the sound. During ""Sex, God, Sex"", Swans suggest the sound of a thousand whips lashing at once; during ""The Seer"", they shape feedback into geometric patterns that Sonic Youth and Sunn O))) alike might admire. So back to <name>Gira</name>'s apparent feebleness: Both times I saw Swans on this tour, they pounded harder than I could have remembered or imagined; <name>Gira</name> lead them through these live shows for two years, so of course he was tired. For one gapless, 30-minute expanse, Swans segue a new sheet-of-noise instrumental, ""The Seer"", into the barking-and-marching classic ""I Crawled"". <name>Gira</name> spends the last quarter of the track moaning, sighing, and doing whatever else he can to sound completely mad. The band lashes together one more time, more malevolent and urgent than before, <name>Gira</name> hollering like he's finally lost. When it's over, he verifies the drain: ""If I had a fucking knife, I'd cut my head off right now."" Somehow, Swans then manage to play a 12-minute version of ""Eden Prison"" that starts and finishes like a whisper but, at its middle, reaches an apogee of high-volume repetition and reward. It's a marvelous payoff of perseverance, a promise that, no, this band or its leader isn't done. In January of 2010, when <name>Gira</name> announced that he was reforming Swans, he wrote a predictably didactic open letter that made his purpose with the band clear: ""After five Angels of Light albums, I needed a way to move FORWARD, in a new direction, and it just so happens that revivifying the idea of Swans is allowing me to do that... THIS IS NOT A REUNION. It's not some dumb-ass nostalgia act. It is not repeating the past."" Some will see this 10-song tracklist and bemoan the absence of old material; four of the tracks come from 2010's My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, while two supposedly come from The Seer, the new Swans album that the first, very-limited edition of this package helped fund in a sort of de facto Kickstarter campaign. (""I decided to start touring Swans, and it's like mainlining heroin,"" <name>Gira</name> told me just before the tour started, prophesying the apparent addiction.) But there are plenty of other Swans live albums if you need to hear that old stuff, and <name>Gira</name> has long clung close to what's most recent, trying new sounds and new members and new modes with admittedly variable results. We Rose is a perfect void of nostalgia that comes at a moment when similar indie rock heroes have reunited to defile the corpses of early works for lump sums of cash. For the last two years, one of the world's most bellicose bands has paid respect to its legacy largely by leaving it alone and tried to expand it by testing its old limits. Here, they do just that, beating past successes with the purpose of the present and showing that-- reunion or no, 58-year-old frontman or no-- this is exactly the kind of forward-pointing roadmark Swans deserve. "
7071	14988	"On their second full-length, Chicago's Disappears have gotten more Zen. Where their mix of Velvet Underground chug and krautrock groove on 2010 debut Lux was pretty melodic, on Guider they're more interested in being hypnotic. They've embraced repetition, using it as an end of its own rather than a way to find hooks. They do offer lots to latch onto-- memorable riffs abound, and revving tempos propel the tunes like a car stuck in 5th gear. But they sound more into straight lines than catchy arcs, more into the moment than what came before.The recording details confirm that immediacy. According to Kranky's press release, all but one track is a first take. In fact, Disappears literally erased the past, recording over tapes originally used for the Lux sessions. Still, for an album so in-the-moment and so short-- it lasts only 30 minutes, and half is taken up by closer ""Revisiting""-- Guider doesn't fly by. All the repetition distorts the sense of time, as if each groove had begun before tape rolled and continued to churn past the end.That aligns Disappears with another band that can turn one riff into an eternal swing, San Francisco's Wooden Shjips. Both also draw openly on classic influences-- Disappears' twitter bio is ""Music for Record Collectors""-- and this time around the common denominator is Spacemen 3. That group's rumbling bass, reflective guitar, and flattened vocals spring up in the quiet/loud drama of ""Not Romantic"", the stair-climbing ""Superstition"", and the shivering riffs of ""Halo"". But Spacemen 3 weren't unique-- they borrowed as much from Suicide and the MC5 as Disappears borrow from them-- and their influence on Guider produces something that can't simply be called a copy.A more valid criticism would be that heavy influence makes Guider less able to transcend genre than the more openly catchy Lux. For me, the band makes up for that deficit in sheer magnetic energy, which isn't easy to wrangle from such a well-worn style. That energy is plentiful enough that Disappears may yet make a record that captures both true believers and recent converts equally."
4973	17284	"For their inspired 2010 debut, Goodbye Falkenburg, Welsh pop fops Race Horses entrusted themselves with the modest but commendable task of honoring the madcap legacy of ancestral countrymen Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. Now, they're ready to take on the rest of the British isles: Furniture handily displaces the loopy 60s-psychedelic and 70s-glam influences of their debut for a bright 80s New Pop sheen and the skyscraping grandeur that defined mid-90s Britpop. But the shift is philosophical as music as it is sonic: Where Goodbye Falkenburg spoke of love and courtship in cheeky, suggestive language, Furniture-- in the arch, observational tradition of ABC and Pulp-- uses its sleek sophistication not just to gloss over the straight-faced tales of emotional woe described within, but as an analogue to the procedural, commoditized nature of modern romance.On the opening title track, frontman <name>Meilyr Jones</name> sounds the death knell for a failing relationship by declaring, ""We are furniture."" By that token, listening to Furniture feels not unlike flipping through an IKEA catalog-- it's easy to get lured in by the pretty surfaces and marvel at the inventiveness at play but, after a while, a certain sterility starts to take hold. At least Race Horses ease you into the album's more despairing worldview-- from the outset, the band is game to play up the knowing contrast between what's being said and how they're saying it. The aforementioned chorus of ""we are furniture"" is delivered less as an insult than a cathartic first step toward post-break-up liberation, while on the winsome ""Mates"", <name>Jones</name> begs an ex to revert to the platonic terms of their pre-hook-up friendship. And in lieu of a new post-reunion Pulp album, we have ""Sisters"", which vividly evokes both the breezy, pop-romantique flair of His N Hers and <name>Jarvis Cocker</name>'s voyeuristic, borderline-pervy intimations.But while it's inevitable that a young band brimming with manic energy will buckle up and simmer down, on Furniture, Race Horses' rapid maturation can feel a little jarring: The synth-speckled piano march ""Nobody's Son"" boasts the kind of instantly anthemic chorus that could spark a football stadium full of cigarette lighters, but it's also the most incongruous track here, as it sacrifices the band's peculiar personality for arena-rock proficiency. And their attempts to get serious yield mixed results: While ""Bad Blood"" successfully channels its anxieties through an intensifying, start-stop structure and ticking synthetic cymbal effect, the equally agitated ""My Year Abroad"" and ""See No Green"" are bogged down by overwrought, repetitive choruses. So it's fitting that this transitory album, preoccupied as it is with romantic upheaval, should close with an somber, affecting piano ballad titled ""Old and New"", with an extended one-chord outro that effectively conjures the titular state of purgatory, and the difficulty of letting go and moving on. It's a sentiment that applies equally to Furniture's emotionally stagnant protagonists as to Race Horses themselves-- it's better to attempt great strides and risk stumbling than to get left in the dust."
12507	9059	"
    The title of Sonic Youth's newest album references a defunct Berkeley, Calif., record store, but it's also a fitting description for the band's tautest set in 25 years. As the militaristic stencils on the cover suggest, these 12 tracks add up to one super chiseled physique; critics needn't exaggerate Rather Ripped's concision, though, Sonic Youth manage to sneak in all sorts of noisy accents, oddball tunings, and crescendo transitions into their so-called pop record.
    That, and it's a grower. After my initial runs through, I appreciated the pristine guitar sound, but the majority of the songs felt boring (over time hooks bloomed). Yet it also proves that New York's premier avant-garde group can write catchy tunes without dipping too deeply into its bag of cracked guitar tricks. Doused with sleek and slippery riffs, the album's early succession of propulsive, three-minute art-pop songs is especially strong.
    The other most striking aspect of the album is that there are more <name>Kim Gordon</name> tracks than on most recent outings. She makes good use of the face time, turning in her best work since ""Kissibility"" and ""Kool Thing"". On ""Reena"" she reminds someone, presumably husband/bandmate <name>Thurston Moore</name>, that ""you keep me coming home again,"" despite her, uh, intense friendship with another woman. Both it and her ""Turquoise Boy"" feature brief <name>Glenn Branca</name>-like breakdowns before returning to <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> and <name>Moore</name>'s shiny guitar playing. On the slinky ""Jams Run Free"", <name>Gordon</name> breathily intones, ""We love the jams."" Rather Ripped has plenty of those.

    Moore's first vocal turn comes on the catchy slip'n'slide single ""Incinerate."" Not an update of Big Black's ""Kerosene"", it may be a love song with over-cooked metaphors or perhaps some actual immolation: ""I ripped your heart of your chest/ Replaced it with a grenade blast...you dosed my soul with gasoline/ You flicked a match into my brain.""

    The strongest track is ""Do You Believe in Rapture"". Set against a backwash of noise, 16-carat ""Bull in the Heather"" strums, and the coupling of a lightly thumping drum machine with <name>Steve Shelley</name> on the real deal, it feels like Daydream Nation's piano burning ""Providence"" turned inside out by Yo La Tengo. Out of nowhere (or maybe out of one guitar strand), it shifts into pop prettiness.

    Somewhere just after the middle of the album, things loose a little oomph, especially on ho-hum tour-diary closer ""Or"". (Though some of its spare sound does echo ""Do You Believe in Rapture"".) On it, <name>Moore</name> begins by describing a girl with ""canisters of whipped cream"" in her ""sweater pockets"" and ends recounting various fan questions, culminating with the queries: ""What comes first? The music or the words?"" On this one, it was hopefully the music. There are a couple late-stage keepers: ""The Neutral""'s crystalline guitar parts drop like snow (again, it's a <name>Kim</name> track) and the longer ""Pink Steam"", a slow-build <name>Moore</name> lust song, is gorgeously windswept and violently romantic.

    The latter brings up something important: ""Pink Steam""'s named after a great collection of diaristic essays, confessional memoirs, and literary tidbits by San Francisco author <name>Dodie Bellamy</name>. I didn't need to look that one up but as a kid, I used Sonic Youth lyrics and liner notes as reading lists-- they led me to <name>Gerhard Richter</name>, <name>Mike Kelley</name>, <name>Richard Kern</name>, <name>Raymond Carver</name>, <name>d.a. levy</name>, and more. They've always been important for bringing downtown NYC's overlapping traditions of art/music/literature to punk kids. Go back to those early records to check out who did the art work for them and read the thank you's. Pre-internet, this was the way to get an underground education.

    Talking to <name>Moore</name> recently for Pitchfork, he said noise's popularity and accessibility seems as a good reason as any to create a relatively noise-free album. He's right: Sonic Youth needn't bother impressing folks at this point. That history can also work against them, but it's boring to parade out each classic and see just how Rather Ripped stacks up to it. So, hey, let's just say it's great to hear <name>Kim</name>, <name>Lee</name>, <name>Steve</name>, and <name>Thurston</name> making an album that sounds beautifully invigorated and goes down smoothly.

1242	21394	"The 2015 documentary Rubble Kings is one of many pieces of cultural ephemera about New York City in the '70s to emerge recently. It focuses on the chaos of the Boogie Down Bronx at a time when the borough was dealing with turbulence so intense that it was liable to burst into flame, but it avoids lazily conflating the chaos of the city and the beauty of the culture that emerged around the same period. Instead, it points to the Hoe Avenue peace meeting, a truce between gangs in the Bronx, as the catalyst for an artistic explosion that presaged the birth of hip-hop.The soundtrack was produced by <name>Little Shalimar</name>, who scored the documentary and has worked as a producer with Run the Jewels among others. The music splits its time between rap tracks and instrumental music by Shalimar that take inspiration from various sonic flavors that were percolating through the Bronx in the '70s. Perhaps attempting to imitate the arc of the film, the album stumbles in the early going with the tough-talking track ""Savage Habits,"" which, even though it features Killer Mike and Bun B, doesn’t quite pound in the way you might hope. (Also, it’s bullshit provincial homerism, but honestly: New Yorkers should open a New York album!)But <name>Little Shalimar</name> makes several clever curatorial choices. Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire hasn’t never quite managed to echo the success of 2011’s Lost in Translation, but he sounds energized on ""Warrior Thing,"" as do indispensable voices like Ka and Ghostface Killah, who show up on later tracks. For the most part, lyrically, the actual bars being spit here are less moving than the voices and vibe. That’s a credit to <name>Shalimar</name>, who has assembled worthwhile soundscapes for at least a couple of rappers who have had a below-average record in the booth in recent years. The Run the Jewels track ""Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite)"" is the high point of the rap cuts, Killer Mike spitting steel-toed syllables over a concrete staircase of a beat, El-P gleefully playing with sibilants in the second verse. The best moments come when <name>Shalimar</name> sticks to instrumentals. His work with the musician <name>Jeremy Wilms</name> (together, they call themselves King Mono) on ""Bouncy 3"" is a standout. ""Partytime"" is a tribute to the breaking culture of outdoor block parties, a mix of hard funk rythms and riffs, and snazzy ballpark synths that sound imported from a Dire Straits song. The narrative arc of the album isn’t quite as arresting as that of the film, but <name>Shalimar</name> does make an effort to say something with the song structure here. That comes into play most notably at the album’s close, with the one-two punch of ""The Piano District (Gentrification Boogie)"" and ""Phoenix."" The first is an instrumental track, part lament, part testimonial to the inexorable movement of money into the Bronx. (That a borough with such a venerable nickname should be renamed so casually by developers is the kind of Gotham micro-tragedy to which city-dwellers are consistently subjected.)""Phoenix"" broadcasts its message through its name. The artists featured, <name>Tunde Adebimpe</name> of TV on the Radio and the singer/songwriter Roxiny (who sounds a little like early Santigold which is to say, amazing) sing an anthem of rebirth, a hopeful song that corresponds with the message of Rubble Kings. But here, as on the album as a whole, any kind of explicit statement has been wrested from a canvas of evocative sonic ideas. The music comes first every time, ably conjuring up the milieu that served as hip-hop’s cradle."
9433	12552	"Over the past decade, there has been grumbling that Einstürzende Neubauten, the West Berlin pioneers of industrial noise, have gone soft. Their most passionate followers, after all, aren't known for their enthusiasm about effete things like melody and guitars. And that is understandable. This is a band that has ""cooked mud, transformed meat to percussion, and recorded 20,000-volt transformer stations,"" that has derived its iconoclastic reputation from its long refusal of modern music's comforts and institutions. Cleverly parting with the music-industrial complex, Jewels culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project, where fans funded the production of their previous record, Alles Wieder Offen, in return for a song a month.First, the band left things to chance, having each member pluck a card from a deck, à la <name>Brian Eno</name>'s ""Oblique Strategies,"" to determine what their role in each song would be. Each card displayed a ""cryptic reference"" to some moment or passage or mood that appears in the Neubauten discography. Effectively, this ""subversive interpretation game"" narrowed the aesthetic range, ensuring a welcome continuity by rooting Jewels in past releases-- the liberties taken here  might remind fans of <name>Halber Mensch</name> or the more recent, assaultive Musterhaus series of CDs. Most challenging, and arguably the most rewarding, are a jerky dive into water (""Mei Ro""), a sandwich of whispers and spaceship ambiance (""I Kissed <name>Glenn Gould</name>""), and a buzzsaw's conversation with a robot (""<name>Vicki</name>"").Newcomers may be happy to hear that eccentricity and harshness on that scale isn't sustained across Jewels. This is plain from the first track, ""Ich Komme Davon"". Hints of melody we found in Silence Is Sexy and Perpetuum Mobile abound here, too, on the opener and the sleekly electronic ""<name>Ansonsten Dostojevsky</name>"". Even the band's growing sensitivity to space and rhythm, last seen in Grundstück, the second installment in the Supporter Project, surfaces on the record's strongest track. At six and a half minutes, ""Die Ebenen werden nicht vermischt"" stands out as epically proportioned, a mash-up of Gregorioid chant and musique concrète that calls to mind an oil derrick toppling into a monastery.For a band that serves as an intermediary stop between trippy Krautrock outfits like Faust and Can on one hand, and bruising sonic nihilists like Test Dept. on the other, <name>Neubauten</name> has eluded pat labels. To be sure, they led the way with industrial music, effectively approaching Home Depot as Guitar Center, but their sound is obviously much more than power-tool improv, and far too varied to stay within one genre, as listeners discover here. Not every song on Jewels is a triumph. But each is a gift, literally, to devotees old and new. Not only a token of appreciation but a reminder that <name>Einstürzende Neubauten</name>'s 28-year career leaps from Howitzer storms of noise to anxious, multiform expanses without sacrificing a whit of their questing, avant-garde intelligence."
1900	20657	"When we think about the creative process we normally think of people coming up with the best ideas they can and executing them to the best of their abilities. There’s another way of working that isn’t as widely discussed, but under the right conditions can produce equally good results, and that’s taking your worst, dumbest ideas and blindly smashing them together. And that’s apparently how the Mothmen made their 1981 album Pay Attention!, an interestingly strange post-punk artifact that’s being reissued by <name>Adrian Sherwood</name>’s On-U Sound.The band obviously had musical smarts. Three of its four members were in the original lineup of the Durutti Column, and all three quit together after Factory records founder <name>Tony Wilson</name> proved himself to be too meddlesome a boss. (The fourth, tellingly, came from a comedy band called Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias.) Three of them went on to have lifelong careers in the music industry that included producing records, managing artists, running labels, and, for two of them, stints in the rhythm section of Simply Red. (Guitarist <name>David Rowbotham</name> fell on hard times and was brutally murdered in 1991, but earned a measure of musical immortality as the subject of the Happy Mondays’ ""Cowboy Dave"".)During their time in the Mothmen, though, all four seem to have ignored those smarts, or possibly consulted them solely to do the opposite of what those smarts said. In the reissue’s lengthy liner notes, drummer <name>Chris Joyce</name> describes their creative process as centering around getting tremendously stoned and having unpremeditated free-form basement jam sessions that they recorded on cassette tapes in case anything worth saving emerged.Between their outre composition methods, the UK post-punk scene’s permissive attitude toward genre combinations, and the band’s high amounts of music nerdiness, Pay Attention! covers an impressive amount of stylistic ground, and produces a number of fascinatingly strange juxtapositions. Intergalactically chill dub reggae turns on a dime into anxiety-riddled Kraftwerk impressions. <name>Syd Barrett</name>’s naive psychedelic twee pop collides with bombastic prog rock. ""Dr. Who"" sound effects are recruited to make Moroccan-style trance music.As you should expect from such helter skelter creative means, some of the material falls short. The 20-minute-long Captain-Beefheart-meets-the-Master-Musicians-of-Joujouka jam ""Mothman"", for instance, is at least 19 minutes too long. (Although both the song itself and the band’s decision to give it its own side of the album say a lot about the quality of hash they were smoking.) But a respectable number of Pay Attention!’s songs, and the various bonus tracks included with the reissue, manage to get off the ground, even if they’re a little ungainly in flight. Even at their stoner goofiest the band had a knack for channeling a particular kind of electric discordant charge that gave their work an unpredictable but potent vibrancy—the same kind of crackle that you get from acts like Thee Oh Sees and Liars who seem to take similar delight in being counterintuitive. So while the Mothmen have always been a footnote in the history of post-punk (something this reissue’s not likely to change), it’s a footnote that adds a fascinating kink to the bigger story around it."
9272	12724	"<name>Luke Temple</name>'s first foray into pseudonymical songwriting territory feels as current as did   Snowbeast  and   Hold a Match for a Gasoline World  , his prior two records released under his given name. But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>and <name>Danielson</name>,   Here We Go Magic  works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters <name>Temple</name>'s psychedelic muse through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The title itself indicates that Here We Go Magic might just be a spur-of-the-moment lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time.The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes   Magic  as both a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with Temple agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has Temple singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of xylophone, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 <name>Paul Simon</name> acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: <name>Temple</name>'s vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests <name>Simon</name>, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions.The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from <name>Temple</name>'s unconscious.  The best bits of Magic are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", <name>Temple</name> blanches his voice to <name>Perry Farrell</name> territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in <name>Temple</name>'s undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with glimmering synth flecks, over which <name>Temple</name>'s voice offers sympathetic counsel. Only swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A fleeting glimpse of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see.By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, 11 minutes of Magic's brief 38 are taken with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. Deerhunter, No Age, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but <name>Temple</name> doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but <name>Temple</name> seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those bits suffer in comparison to those other 27 minutes of Magic: a sculpted version of that same disarming din, with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing."
12928	1799	"On the surface, <name>Christina Carter</name>'s distinctive, free-floating improvisations seem as though they could only be born of solitude and introspection. So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the storied psych-folk combo Charalambides, <name>Carter</name> has also paired with <name>Heather Leigh Murray</name> as Scorces, recorded as a duo with <name>Loren Mazzacane Connors</name>, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit <name>Andrew MacGregor</name>, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first full harvest with the prolonged, disembodied howl of We've.

    Recorded live at KDVS radio in California, We've consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in <name>Carter</name>'s catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of British Columbia, <name>MacGregor</name>'s hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with <name>Carter</name>'s lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, the duo's fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors.

    The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as <name>Carter</name> and <name>MacGregor</name> almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. Though the session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, the piece has a profound sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully illuminated against a dark, bottomless expanse. It's unclear if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, and We've seems to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia.

    Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, <name>MacGregor</name>'s guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to <name>Tom Carter</name>'s fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in Charalambides. As the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, <name>Derek Bailey</name>-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with <name>Christina Carter</name>'s output, We've proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable talents."
4440	17858	"<name>James Ferraro</name> has become one of the most divisive artists in underground music, although he didn't start out that way. <name>Ferraro</name> has released an extraordinary amount of material since 2004, but you can divide his career into two parts, with 2011's solo album Far Side Virtual as the turning point. As half of noise and drone duo the Skaters and altered tape constructivists Lamborghini Crystal, he enjoyed wide acclaim, but Far Side Virtual saw him equally dismissed as a charlatan and lauded as a visionary.Talking about FSV in an interview with The Wire, <name>Ferraro</name> called it “an opera for our consumption civilization.” In his work since, it became apparent that <name>Ferraro</name>'s interest in the representation of capitalism coincided with a preoccupation with some of its most prestigious and powerful manifestations: namely modern hip-hop. Inhale C-4 $$$$$$$, a mixtape released under the alias Bebetune$ that swiftly followed FSV, and Silica Gel, released in 2012 as Bodyguard, made this clear. By the time <name>Ferraro</name> got to Sushi at the end of 2012, a physical release under his own name, the shapeshift was complete. He had reached a unique and beguiling electronic body music heavily informed by commercial R&B and hip-hop, but somehow contained in his own distroid soundworld.With new mixtape Cold, that restless creativity remains in forward motion. <name>Ferraro</name>'s consistency lies mostly in his ability to confound, a disconnect of simultaneous banality and profundity that has threaded through his output more clearly than any allegiance to a particular sound or genre. For example, one of the most obvious shifts on Cold is his singing. It's on almost every track-- you can't have R&B without it, right? He still doesn't sing very well, but while occasionally painful, the Auto-Tuned balladry is fascinating in its oddness. This style of vocal is almost always reserved for professionals, and hearing <name>Ferraro</name>'s amateur but earnest attempts are endearing. Not unlike his pre-FSV solo period when he made an aesthetic out of the hyper-compressed sound of poor bitrate mp3s, it's almost as if he gets a kick out of doing things he knows he shouldn't, upending clearly defined and accepted notions of taste.The production, on the other hand, is accomplished-- and unusual. One pleasure of the record is the moments where his instinctive, unquantized, sensual funk materializes. Another is in its weird samples: a single coin falling to the floor, what sounds like a sword being drawn from a scabbard, the muffled unintelligibility of distorted voices in the background, digital rain-- all of those appear on “Slave to the Rain”, topped by lyrics like, “Wanna have babies/ And you shower them in cash.” Some might be tempted to compare it to the tongue-in-cheek pop of HD Boyz, but that would be unfair: that Dis Magazine-fueled project was never sincere, and featured experimental artists aping the mainstream. But here this essentially experimental artist clearly manifests mainstream influences.If the text on the press release for this mixtape (“Cold is the repetition and consumption of hedonism that cannot represent or replace one night of love... Cold outlines the human drama in a nihilistic era."") is taken at face value, <name>Ferraro</name> is still pondering the affect of capitalism. But his interests have been redirected musically,and he touches on the restless groove of two-step, bass swells of dubstep, the tightly sequenced synths of techno, dive-bar lounge blues, and symphonic string arrangements. And while he doesn't really flaunt the vaporwave sound he practically gave birth to with FSV, he does acknowledge it, even going so far as to call a song “Vapor Weight”. But the point with <name>James Ferraro</name> isn't so much that he's constantly switching genres. It's more that he's actually inventing them as he goes along, or changing them so much they become reinvented. Hypnagogic pop, vaporwave, distroid-- he's had a crucial role in them all. Within his sphere, <name>Ferraro</name> is one of the most important artists of his generation though, as Cold demonstrates, it's hard to get a handle on his career from any single release."
13536	3836	"In 2001, <name>Matthew Herbert</name> released The Mechanics of Deconstruction under his Radio Boy moniker. Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that Herbert found objectionable. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". The Mechanics of Deconstruction was a curious artifact, moving <name>Herbert</name>'s hypercritical pop art into a more overt realm, and, best of all, it was a free download. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of <name>Herbert</name>'s anti-corporate rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of Herbert's genius with sampling and arrangement.

    The fire inside that motivated <name>Herbert</name> to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one Frappucino-- still burns. Plat du Jour shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the critical guns are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, again, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso.

    With <name>Herbert</name>, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to Plat du Jour five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive coops of terrified chickens are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act.

    The songs that work best are faster and let <name>Herbert</name> indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's weird noises coalesce beautifully into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with its title and theme, as it sounds like something Tim Burton might've incorporated into his film of <name>Charlie</name> and the Chocolate Factory, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of menace lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as funky as a package of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!""

    Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what <name>Herbert</name> is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? I've read Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, McDonald's or otherwise, in three or four years (though the <name>Schlosser</name> book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and <name>Herbert</name> has done a lot better."
1889	20631	"Sightings’ sound was the industrial noise-rock equivalent of stumbling upon a barroom brawl, and that gnashing, mangling jumble was integral to the late NYC trio’s appeal. Spitting bile through clenched teeth, <name>Mark Morgan</name> conjured flanged wastelands via guitar; <name>Jon Lockie</name> pounded primal, desperate drums; and <name>Richard Hoffman</name> whipped up hypnotic, Lotto-hopper basslines. At Sightings’ most ferocious, on uncompromising slabs like 2002’s Michigan Haters and 2005’s End Times, these elements entangled so thrillingly and violently that they became impossible to separate.The band unexpectedly called it a day in the spring of 2013. Recorded during the sessions for that year’s Terribly Well LP, Amusers and Puzzlers feels less like a swan song than the inevitable next evolutionary step. Though the crude no wave of 2002’s Sightings would give way, over the years, to sharper fidelity and songcraft and the odd stylistic tangent—check 2004’s Arrived in Gold, a photo-negative spin on the band’s enervating convulsions—true change surfaced with 2011’s Future Accidents. The 19-minute long instrumental ""Public Remains"" ushered in a studied, queasy ambience that split the difference between cut-up drone, dub, and gutter blues. Indeed, this muted malevolence would carry over to the wordless cyborg whirr and stammer of Terribly Well’s ""Yellow""—even as the surrounding tunes snarled characteristically, if less caustically.Amusers and Puzzlers strikes a similar balance of short order bomb-out and wandering balm. ""Counterfeited"" segues from squirmy bass-led melodic figure to crazed percussive thump and back, as guitars seethe and squawk off in the corner. ""13"" strains, stipples, and thrums, all sandpaper tension and slurried distortion; the pulverizing ""Trials of Peter"" shoves in every direction at once. ""1982"" imagines a manic atonal triptych—short-circuiting guitar next to irrepressible bass bounce next to coiled drumkit OCD—then slowly increases the tempo as <name>Morgan</name> transforms into the world’s most unhinged carnival barker; it’s like listening to a punk song being fed into a clogged garbage disposal.The irradiated, 16-minute ""Syllabus of Error"" casts a long bummer of a shadow over the rest, representative of The Ghost of Sightings Future in a way that ""Public Remains"" and ""Yellow"" could only hint at. A brittle patchwork of drones thrumming at various frequencies and abrupt static smears, ""Syllabus"" feels unsettling, haunted—at once slighter and more haphazard than its predecessors. Gorgeous, aquatic guitar chords drift idly past or flame out curtly; feedback threatens to knife the variegated din. Glassine, sonar effects sound. A rattling buzz lends the tableau an additional air of menace that eventually consumes any warmth that might have been implied early on. This was clearly the direction Sightings were headed in, and had they soldiered forward, it would have been fascinating to hear where they'd eventually wind up."
10822	10843	"One hardly needs to see <name>Pascal Arbez DJ</name> in order to have a good sense of what he sounds like live. As thrilling as most of Vitalic's recorded material is, it's not exactly nuanced. Given that Vitalic's best songs-- tracks like ""La Rock 01"", ""Poney"", and ""My Friend Dario""-- are quick-hit adrenaline rushes that build and crest with the dancefloor in mind, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the best way to present them live is to turn the volume up and cordially step out of the way. Since <name>Arbez</name> doesn't have the technical aptitude or the layering sensibilities of your average techno DJ, nor the desire to mash up his tracks with anyone else's, that's pretty much exactly what he does. All things told, it's the right way to play it. <name>Arbez</name> might be crude, but if the reactions of the crowds I've seen him play to are anything to go by, he's definitely effective.
    A live album, though-- that's another thing entirely. Forgetting for a second that Vitalic has only one full-length record to its name and that the easy availability of free mp3 bootlegs of DJ sets has largely rendered the live electronic album a gratituous and pointless gesture, what in the world made anyone think that Vitalic's live show was interesting enough, purely as a listening experience, to warrant its own release?
    Well, it's not. While they might sound a bit brighter and pulse a little harder, there's ultimately nothing significantly improved about these songs on Live. If anything, this recording detracts from a lot of the material; for some inexplicable reason, <name>Arbez</name> has made the aesthetic decision to insert the audience's reactions high in the mix. The end effect is similar to watching a sitcom with canned laughter; each subtle shift in the audience's mood is so front and centre that you end up feeling like you're being prompted to respond in kind. (And the less said about the weirdly incongrous football chants that pop up from time to time, the better.)
    Of course, the sugar rush nature of Vitalic's best tracks mean there are some thrills to be had here; the goosebump-inducing buildup to ""La Rock 01"", for example, is one of those rare moments where Live works in spite of itself. Ultimately, though, as a listening experience, it's a tough sell. Without the communal feeling that comes from standing in a crowd of people and the visceral thrill that comes from having these songs blasted at you in the context of a physical space, what's the point? Your guess is as good as mine."
11568	10052	"Remember 2004? Remember suicidal depression in November, a whole summer spent watching VH1's ""I Love the 90s"", and the swift and vicious post-2 Many DJs backlash against ""eclectic"" DJ mixes? Well three years later, I'm still loving this tendency in 21st century mixology to just play whatever sounds good, regardless of genre or year of release. Besides, backlash comes and goes. The deserved acclaim thrown at the feet of Scottish duo Optimo is proof that even grouchy grousers have grown more comfortable with a generation of DJs out to keep on unearthing cool old music. All they're trying to do is share, you know.
    Optimo's JD Twitch lent a hand with the recording for <name>Justine D</name>'s Mx5, the latest mix CD from New York's Rvng boutique, following top shelf limited edition discs from Crazy Rhythms (the duo of <name>Dan Selzer</name> and <name>Mike Simonetti</name>) and DFA duder <name>Tim Sweeney</name>. Unlike Optimo's mixes-- potentially deadly acts of multi-track chainsaw juggling pulled off with the blithe, dizzying panache of assured showmen-- <name>Justine D</name> blends and bleeds across eras with just your traditional DJ fades and chops, while still casting a wide net for cool records. A jury of cranky dance music fans might look at the tracklist for Mx5 and simply conclude ""eclectic,"" but I'm fairly comfortable saying it's the first mix CD to ever feature Chic, Crass, and the Cars.
    But like kohl around the eye, <name>Justine D</name> traces a small, dark spot on the dancefloor where flamboyant goth-pop, haughty electro(clash), hypnotic techno, rigid EBM, concrete block German new wave, skeletal punk, and glam-era <name>Bowie</name> all intersect. (She takes a short side trip at the start for a little shoegaze'n'sitars psychedelic baggy.) It's a mid-tempo nighttime stroll through various districts of black-clad clubland, dour disco for dancing in place. Not for nothing does she choose the strings from the most zombie-zonked of Chic tracks, the ravenous but exhausted plea of ""I Want Your Love"". The smashed neon and burnt chrome of Mx5's proto-techno and bleak disco could be the soundtrack to Blade Runner's wayward replicant Priss, lost on 2014's Hollywood Boulevard Babylon.

    Despite contemporary DJs and mp3 blog culture making formerly forbidden found sounds like <name>Mick Fleetwood</name> afro-disco tracks and <name>Alan Parsons</name> Project album cuts cool for old punkers and nu-ravers alike, many are still wary of anything tagged in iTunes as ""goth"" or ""industrial."" My primary introduction to dance music came from an older girlfriend who had grown up and through the succession of 80s electronic beat music, from synthpop to industrial, hitting New York after college just as house music did. Listening to Mx5 brought back some pretty uncanny memories from the years we dated-- learning about Nitzer Ebb and the Orb at the same time, getting into arguments about Ministry on the subway, slowly shedding my prejudices via rock- and foot-friendly bands like Christian Death that all goth had be a) Slow, and b) Terrible. (All of my fellow My Chemical Romance fans are urged to check out Only Theatre of Pain.)

    All of those artists are on Mx5, snug in the DJ box next to more expected fare such as Hot Chip, <name>Delia</name> and <name>Gavin</name>, and Italian synth-soundtrack maestros Goblin-- whose nightmarish combo of distant drums, music box chimes, gargling vocals, and death-folk guitar is the creepiest thing on the disc, and that's before it turns into a funk rock record produced by <name>Giorgio Moroder</name> in Grandpa Munster drag. Surprise, surprise-- it all sounds great. I'm not convinced enough to go trawling through the Wax Trax stax just yet, but isn't that why we keep DJs around, to find these shiny lumps of coal? ""Beware the savage lure of 1984,"" Mr. <name>Bowie</name> seems to be warbling on the song of the same name, but that's very poor advice on the evidence of Mx5.

2915	19612	"Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt remain the linchpins of Odd Future’s rapping prowess, but other members of the rank and file have upped their weight since the group first achieved notoriety. Though Hodgy Beats has long been a competent technical rapper, his performance on Insa, the recent release from his Mellowhype partnership with producer Left Brain, shows him to have made major improvements since the last time we heard from him (on the smoked-out MellowHigh). The way he skates over his verses, threatening to spin recklessly out of control while never doing so, vaults him into the ranks of other top-rate OF rhymers—I’d argue that he’s at least reached the skill level of his old pal, fellow weed-lover and MellowHigh addition, Domo Genesis.<name>Hodgy</name>’s improvement is most obvious on <name>Insa</name>’s more high-energy tracks. The mixtape’s lead single, “Nowadays"", is the best example, with <name>Hodgy</name> dropping whiplash references to ex-Lakers and his eating habits, “pickin the skin off chickens and skipping on grandma dinner rolls.” That’s a line that exemplifies the rappers’ style: while he’s as beholden to the call of internal rhyme as your average DOOM stan, <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses never feel cramped. Instead his bars flow freely downhill, with plenty of momentum to ease the density of his wordplay.  On other standouts, such as record opener “Gang” and the ogre-core stomp of “Fifafofum!”, that free-for-all feeling is reminiscent of the old Odd Future energy, anarchic, chaotic and genuinely exciting.Mellowhype live up to their portmanteau on the other half of the record; when the hype dies down, the duo lace listeners with a trio of boilerplate “light-one-up” tracks.  The strongest offering of the three is the shortest: on “The Daze"", Left Brain makes the smart choice of looping the collective soft scatting of <name>Syd</name> tha Kyd (who has quietly become one of the collective’s most magnetic stars) underneath the verses before unleashing her on the chorus. The result is neo-soul at its finest, <name>Syd</name>’s calming presence providing a proper foil for an agitated <name>Hodgy</name>.Though <name>Hodgy</name> has undoubtedly improved, he still occasionally struggles to channel his kinetic verses and forceful delivery into compelling songs. Traditionally, on Mellowhype albums, Left Brain has swooped in to save songs where <name>Hodgy</name> falls flat—his production has always been at least as compelling as <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses and the duo’s best songs, from “La Bonita"", to “SmokeSumKushWitme"", have benefitted from his  enigmatic, energetic beats.  On Insa, for whatever reason, he’s pulled back a bit, flirting with boom-bap and quiet storm samples in contrast to his usual bombast and left field choices, and as a result, there’s nothing to redeem <name>Hodgy</name> when he gets caught in a bad loop. So whether it be on the rote gangsterisms of “Belly’s” second verse or the rote misogyny of the concept song “7” (“got a bitch for every day of the week”), Left Brain’s beats here are a little too subdued to entirely rescue the worst of the rappity-rap proceedings.Insa (which stands for “I need some answers”) was released on July 4th as a free mixtape, and as such, it punches well above its weight, a reminder of just how skilled the broader Odd Future collective is. And yet, like the class clowns they were billed as when they introduced themselves to the world, the group’s potential always seems to loom above their output as a ceiling they haven’t yet cracked—file Insa as another release from the collective that’s a shrug-worthy solid rather than the rap-realigning release that was once predicted for the group. Hodgy Beats and Left Brain are capable of being a top-rate rapper and a top-rate producer respectively, and neither is a kid anymore. Isn’t it past time that they came out with something a little more challenging, or at least more memorable?"
4497	17753	<name>Daniel Woolhouse</name> lived a double life in the run-up to recording his debut full-length as Deptford Goth. By day, the south Londoner was a teaching assistant in an elementary school; by night, he recorded synthesizer-plumped ballads in his front room. You hope for the kids’ sake that there wasn’t much correspondence between the two; story time round <name>Daniel</name>’s is a gloomy hour, full of mumbled doubts and unsettling lullabies. Unlike the playfulness and joy of creation inherent in, say, former kindergarten teacher Bat for Lashes’ debut, there’s little obvious link between <name>Woolhouse</name>’s personal and private worlds on Life After Defo, a disconnect that persists throughout the album.Establishing these barriers is clearly some kind of protective reflex for <name>Woolhouse</name>: For his part, he says that he knows he’s not very expressive in conversation, and that making music “is kind of a way of transmitting those feelings without having to look someone in the eye.” But Defo plies its trade in indistinct “feelings”: The title is meant to allude to a state post-certainty (“Deffo” is a British abbreviation for “definitely” mostly used by posh students), which is backed up by a frustrating emptiness in many of the lyrics, most of which aren’t audible. “There must never be/ There will never be/ There will never be…” <name>Woolhouse</name> repeats during the chorus of “Bloody Lip”, without ever specifying what terrible thing must never again come to pass. “Something’s coming and I can’t see what it is,” he mumbles on the whirring glow of “Union”, reminding us that one man's profound uncertainty is another's half-assed, unfinished thought.Defo sounds very beautiful, though there’s little to positively distinguish it from similar records by Active Child, How to Dress Well (XL Recordings house engineer <name>Rodaidh McDonald</name> worked on Total Loss and Defo), and Rhye. <name>Woolhouse</name> became known through a <name>Mariah Carey</name> tribute jam, but says that “at the heart of every song there is a little old blues singer with a guitar.” He’s buried deep if so, beneath a monastic, reverential cloud that couches glimmering organs, stuttering firecracker percussion, beatific harp sounds, and an occasional ominous sheen that sounds skimmed from a softer Mount Eerie record. There's been a significant reduction in tempo and action since 2011's Youth II EP. If that folk singer is there at all, it’s in the forlorn, digitized <name>Bon Iver</name>-style vocal swoops that haunt a number of the songs. Everything here is very well executed, tasteful, and gravely intimate, but when “Bronze Age” clanks and moans into motion like a weepy <name>James Blake</name> leading a chain gang, some heart monitor bleeps vainly searching to blur the “real and synthetic” effect <name>Woolhouse</name> explores here, it’s not hard to crave something sexier, more melodically robust, and stirring.To give Defo its dues, <name>Woolhouse</name> has a knack for earwormy melodies, and when he pushes against his comfort zone, he can end up somewhere compelling. “Years” starts as a forlorn, vocal-led lull, but swarms into a dark, wheezing flurry of processed cries, deep horns, and loose, splashing cymbals that bear a certain similarity to post-rock done Tortoise-style. Given that <name>Woolhouse</name> almost exclusively mumbles throughout the record, the lyrical clarity of the chorus to “Object Objects” becomes quite affecting by comparison: “If you’re telling me there’s no such thing as heartache,” he sings, the incredulous high note of “telling me” debunking the notion better than a conclusion probably could in this situation, as the skeleton of some house tune chirrups around him.Like the xx’s debut album, Life After Defo will gain in vitality as it becomes the personal soundtrack to moments of horizontal intimacy and loneliness. But where xx was incredibly direct and specific, and all the more human for that, Defo doesn’t give a great deal in the first place, its ethereal chilliness leeching off the human emotions that will undoubtedly be fed to it. Taken as a whole, it’s a pretty, enveloping record that executes its modern influences with panache, though the intangible, purely aesthetic nature of <name>Woolhouse</name>’s vaguely downhearted emotional state makes it hard to appreciate Defo as anything other than luxurious ambient icing.
1954	20609	"<name>Brandon Flowers</name> is hard to pin down as a pop star, in part because he's still playing at being a pop star. After he stepped into the limelight on the Killers’ still-terrific debut at 22-years-old, he made three more records with his band full of bona fide arena anthems as well as cheap knock-offs that substitute as arena anthems. The latter is why it's advisable to skip over most of his 2010 solo debut Flamingos, if only because the beige, desert-tinged production says and adds very little to his songwriting. The album is clunky and rote even by the Flowers metric.But with the help of Grammy-winning producer <name>Ariel Rechtshaid</name>, The Desired Effect gives <name>Flowers</name> new backdrops to play around in. <name>Rechtshaid</name> doesn’t mine the '80s and '90s for inspiration like he's done for <name>Haim</name>, <name>Taylor Swift</name>, <name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>, and many others recently. Instead, he straight up jacks that sound, aiming directly at those fond of the calmer side of Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, or <name>Peter Gabriel</name>. Electric guitars are swapped out for chugging piano lines, hand-clap snares, and melismas sung by anonymous background singers; never mind the inclusion of special guest <name>Bruce Hornsby</name>, a song that samples Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" and features <name>Neil Tennant</name> on vocals, and floppy disc after floppy disc worth of synth patches. Credit to <name>Rechtshaid</name>, the album’s big and luxe sound fits <name>Flowers</name>' big and luxe voice. When they sync up in this milieu, against all odds, it works really well.Above these glossy textures, <name>Flowers</name> doubles down on his earnest goobery, which actually brings him closer to this ideal pop star image he's been chasing. Not since Sam’s Town has <name>Flowers</name> sounded so at home in song. ""Can’t Deny My Love"" is a masterclass in '80s production tricks (wooden pan flutes! pitch-wavering synth pads! orchestra hits!) with one of those famous, powerful hooks that made him so likable to begin with. It’s cheesy, but the cluster-bomb of ideas is ultimately what makes you want to go back for repeat listens. Likewise, on the mid-tempo ballad ""Never Get You Right"" <name>Flowers</name> finds the perfect equation for his sincerity and hyperbole. Again, it’s the hook and his voice that do most of the heavy lifting, but the song works because of a simple idea. You look at someone you know and love (who in <name>Flowers</name>' case is possibly a sex worker) and think how ""They’ll turn you into something whether you are it or not/ But they’ll never get you right.""There are more huge Killers-ready songs to fill stadiums or casinos (""Dreams Come True"" and ""Untangled Love"") and hoary love songs (""Still Want You""), but <name>Flowers</name> can’t help but trip over himself as he’s writing. He’s just so daffy. He sings ""Friday nights, football stands"" and you just pray the sports imagery stops there, but sure enough, he follows it up with ""been fumbled by so many hands."" It’s always just one move too many. Sometimes he reaches for the cliché like ""ship of fools"" or ""casting...stones"" and sometimes he does some gangly inversion of one, like, ""She wasn't having anything, no birds or any bees/ Girl, don't go shootin' all the dogs down just cause one's got fleas."" At best, <name>Flowers</name> is too wordy and obvious. At worst, he is BruceSpringsteen_ebooks, cobbling together blue-collar American signifiers in odd arrays that appear to have meaning but are really just empty gestures.""Whether the people want to accept it or not, we might be the best band in the last long time!” said <name>Flowers</name> regarding the Killers in a recent interview. This quote is great because it says everything you need to know about <name>Flowers</name> as a songwriter: He believes deeply in himself by way of absurd and often extra-grammatical reasons. At his essence, <name>Flowers</name> is a big beating heart that under too much scrutiny will shrivel and die. He is bound for excess and Desired Effect delivers on precisely that, at precisely the level you’d imagine a happily married, 33-year-old with millions of dollars in the bank would. Don’t think too much about the heavy-handed religiosity on ""The Way It’s Always Been"" or the the heartland rock aberration ""Diggin' Up the Heart"". Just let his words wash over you, subtly, like being tackled by 20 puppies. <name>Flowers</name> gives off charm and stupidity in the same breath and it is as comforting as it is disposable. It’s the mark of a pretty good pop star."
15792	2890	"At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing. I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have
    kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy English
    moaners like Morrissey and the Psychedelic Furs and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who
    understood both the charm of romantic, British new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could
    crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared
    bashful soft spots for the Sisters of Mercy and the Ocean Blue. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would
    be My Time. Right?

    Yeah, well, I was fourteen: dim as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing,
    no matter how lovable.  The best, New York's Interpol-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist
    prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't because of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds.
    It's a stretch to expect another.

    More common are bands like Longwave, whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a
    lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant Average Guitar Bands.  They know their Pixies riffs back to front.  They've studied the driving jangle
    and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides of the Atlantic.  They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's
    affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on M2 and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice.

    Elefant are okay, if disappointingly just okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a more-British Longwave?), though their inspirations are probably
    the most Anglophilic of the bunch: frontman and songwriter <name>Diego Garcia</name> has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no
    matter how much it attempts to showcase a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like <name>David Bowie</name> croons, despite
    frequent attempts to growl them up a little. If Interpol-- apart from <name>Carlos</name>-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a Pet Shop Boys record, well, I'll bet <name>Diego</name> did.  ""Suburbia"", at least.

    But that's all subtext: for the bulk of Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid's ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential
    is audible in the first track, ""Make Up"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push
    underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; <name>Garcia</name> wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all suave before eventually rolling, repeating, and chewing up the
    phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of superfast arpeggios, and a moment later, it's back to atmospheric
    plucks; guitar-handler <name>Mod</name>'s remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths.

    ""Bokkie"" starts with a boxing-bass strut that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between <name>Garcia</name>'s
    lines. These guys have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""Tonight Let's Dance"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes
    they've picked out of it: it's the rhythm-led pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism.

    The problem is that <name>Garcia</name> isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of Interpol's, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit
    recreationists My Favorite (note to <name>Diego</name>: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). If Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter
    of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues.  Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug
    and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax
    return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over.

    Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny American indie bands with their unforced
    and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere.  A lot has happened
    since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have.  Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through
    the looking glass is hardly magical."
3600	18802	"If there's anything like a normal year for <name>Bob Pollard</name> fans, 2013 wasn't it. These past 12 months did offer a fine new EP and an okay-enough album—their fourth since early 2012—from the reunited Guided by Voices. But it's become increasingly clear that a classic on par with the lo-fi legends' peak-era material might've been a little too much to ask for. Then there was the late-summer tiff between <name>Pollard</name> and drummer <name>Kevin Fennell</name>, whose unsuccessful attempt to peddle the beaten-to-shit drumkit he'd recorded many GBV classics on got him publicly shamed and subsequently fired by his old pal <name>Bob</name>. Bursts of drama notwithstanding, shows were few and far between, and side-hustles have been scant and largely of little consequence. The lone bright spot came this summer, when <name>Pollard</name> issued the rich, graceful Honey Locust Honky Tonk, instantly cementing itself as one of the best records under his own name. Now, <name>Pollard</name>'s closing out this weird year with Blazing Gentlemen, a headier, rockier counterpoint to the unfailingly sweet Honey Locust.For a guy who's made records every which way, the approach <name>Pollard</name> took with Gentlemen's construction is especially peculiar. Instead of appliquéing words onto melodies, he built these songs from the lyrics up, scouring his notebooks line-by-line for titles and lyrics, then writing melodies—and then chords—around those. <name>Pollard</name>'s always been a collagist—sometimes quite literally—but this method feels especially piecemeal; every few lines, the underriding melody seems to shift, leaving behind any sense of continuity. Much of <name>Pollard</name>'s best work has taken a similarly attention-deficient tack, although Gentlemen's disjointment is at the micro level, all mismatched segments and jarring transitions. And, given the wide range in quality between one segment to the next, your time with Gentlemen's spent waiting around for the good part, only to find it gone before you've been properly introduced.Ramrodding through 16 songs in 32 minutes and change, Gentlemen may be the least classically pretty <name>Pollard</name> in ages; ballads are scant, distortion's applied liberally, and while the fidelity's fairly high and the instrumentation consistent, the collection—throwing Honey Locust's carefully considered lushness in stark relief—opts for the quick and dirty. <name>Pollard</name> and Gentlemen cohort <name>Todd Tobias</name>—together, responsible for every sound you hear on the record—have certainly arranged a plaintive melody or two in their day, but Gentlemen largely leaves these overexcitable songs to their own devices. Opener ""Magic Man Hype"" is held together by sheer inertia, rumbling through chord after oddball chord. The title track matches a sludgy verse to a towering chorus, which would be fine, if an out-from-nowhere bridge didn't pop up to derail the forward motion. ""His passionless kisses are real hits and misses,"" <name>Pollard</name> sings on ""Blazing Gentlemen"", and that pretty much sums it up: song for song, <name>Pollard</name> records are typically a hodgepodge, but the eternally jumpy Gentlemen whittles that inconsistency down to a second-by-second basis.Whenever <name>Pollard</name> can keep an idea in his head for more than a minute at a time, Gentlemen starts to click. The cowbell-imbued ""Faking the Boy Scouts"" sports the set's stickiest hook; sure, its verses are a tad on the jittery side, but unlike much of Blazing Gentlemen, they at least seem to be acquainted with the chorus that follows. ""Tea People"" is one of those effortlessly catchy, totally stupid stompers only <name>Pollard</name> can get away with, and again, its verse and chorus seem to have been in the same room before. But for every song that seems to have been conceived as a piece, there are two more assembled from whatever they had lying around. ""Tonight's the Rodeo"" is elegant enough at first, but its chorus—all three seconds of it—is given neither time nor space to develop itself as anything but a nuisance. The lyrics are just as scatterbrained as the music, notebook dumps turned not-so-exquisite corpses; <name>Pollard</name>-logic is never an easy path to follow, but Gentlemen gets your head spinning in a fashion that'll have you swearing off the stuff the next morning.Are two half-formed ideas as good as one complete thought? Gentlemen seems to think so. But, for all of Gentlemen's nervy shapeshifting, its fitful thrills never quite make for a satisfying whole; it's too restless, too scattered, too gangly. Even the record's more-consistent-than-usual sound can't help hold these spasmodic, shapeshifting songs together for more than a couple minutes at a time. Some fans will no doubt revel in Gentlemen's endless discrepancies; after all, part of being a <name>Pollard</name> obsessive is learning to take the bad with the good. But, on Gentlemen, the bad and the good are so manically intertwined, it gets to be a little tough telling them apart. Gentlemen's about as interesting as middling <name>Pollard</name> records get, but it's middling all the same, a fittingly abnormal end to a most unusual year."
6653	15428	"In addition to turning in three very solid albums of his own in the past few years, <name>Chad VanGaalen</name> also produced fellow Albertans Women. The two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic idiosyncrasies-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into <name>VanGaalen</name>'s world rather than the other way around.So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth LP, Diaper Island. <name>VanGaalen</name>'s previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to electronic synth workouts, and they often sound like grab-bags drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently told an interviewer he had recorded 80 songs leading up to this record). Part of what makes Diaper Island a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage.On Diaper Island <name>VanGaalen</name> internalizes feelings of restlessness into the fabric of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like Sonic Youth and Pavement loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. But the song's melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. It's a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that <name>VanGaalen</name> used to perform with production switches on previous records.But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as <name>VanGaalen</name>'s excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels zig-zagging verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and <name>VanGaalen</name> allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""Blonde Hash"".The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. <name>VanGaalen</name> sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of <name>VanGaalen</name>'s character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole.<name>VanGaalen</name> closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and Diaper Island-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm <name>VanGaalen</name>'s status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer."
4816	17359	"<name>Tiga</name>, better known for his tastemaking and mixing skills than his productions, has one really important skill: He makes niche scenes feel populist. He did this most memorably in 2003, when his DJ-Kicks mix made the booming electroclash scene play like a big party instead of a bunch of pissy punk rockers with sequencers. Since then he's released a trunk-full of singles and remixes, along with two artist albums notable mostly for their goofy insouciance. Less visibly, he's stewarded the shockingly productive Turbo Recordings, a label that, if it hasn't quite predicted every major trend in dance music during the last half-decade, has at least been on the cusp, from Chromeo's 80s revivalism to Azari & III's pilfering of Chicago house to the label's more recent focus on the gritty end of tech house. His record as a taste barometer is flawless.Befitting his label's recent direction, <name>Tiga</name>'s Non Stop mix for Pias/Different Recordings focuses on pug-nosed, gritty dance. <name>Tiga</name> weaves them into a broader pop context that includes nonchalant indie-electro (Kindness' magnificent Mats' cover, ""Swingin' Party"") and contemporary pop-rap-- his Tyga-refactoring ""Track City Bitch"" is clever and annoying. These are sore thumbs, obvious ones from an artist who has snatched in for reworking ""Sunglasses at Night"" and ""Hot in Here"", but they're hardly all that's on offer. Non Stop shines when it marries the rambunctiousness of recent Turbo mainstays such as Clouds and <name>Duke Dumont</name> with everything from abstract indie (Actress' Panda Bear remix) to noise-punk tirades (Factory Floor) and analogue purism (the hotly tipped Blawan and Locked Groove).It's those Turbo artists that Non Stop really cradles, all this infrastructure that makes <name>Duke Dumont</name>'s ""Street Walker"" the type of track casual fans could pick out of a lineup; that makes Clouds' stomping ""Those Cracks in Your Face, Do They Hurt?"" sound playful. He's not offering these tracks in context: he's removing them from it, from an all-house, all-techno world in which they might seem gray, or rote, or merely good. There is a level of whimsy here not available in a standard Fabric or DJ-Kicks offering. That whimsy can serve as a gateway, and that's really valuable.Non Stop is an alloy so primly tailored to every conceivable dance music trend that it's worth wondering if <name>Tiga</name> has a cool nephew or a bug planted in a Hardwax buyer's laptop. The real explanation-- that <name>Tiga</name> is an exceptionally tuned-in connoiseur-- is less exciting, but it doesn't subtract from the casual mixology of Non Stop. <name>Tiga</name>'s Turbo label has expertly shifted its focus over the years, but his mixing remains an all-<name>Tiga</name> affair, expertly unfocused, still hanging streamers and balloons in unlikely places."
13812	3479	"Should I still phone my class of '86 NYU buds whenever a new Go-Betweens record is released? The band has now released more LPs this decade than current indie staples like the Shins, New Pornographers, and Strokes, so can we please drop the ""Welcome back!"" fanfare. Fortunately, Oceans Apart doesn't need the same apologetic disclaimer tagged onto 2000's The Friends of <name>Rachel Worth</name> and 2003's Bright Yellow Bright Orange. Frontmen Robert Forster and Grant McLennan probably needed those two lackluster works to shake off 11 years worth of rust, but with Oceans Apart, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> regain their songwriting momentum. <name>Forster</name> redeems himself right from the start-- opener ""Here Comes a City"" is a jerky post-punk rocker highlighted by a jangly Middle Eastern riff. It packs more confidence and intensity in its first 10 seconds than all of Bright Yellow Bright Orange's hoary folk balladry.

    Of course, some credit's also due to longtime Go-Betweens producer <name>Mark Wallis</name>, whose presence on Oceans Apart also signifies a return to the stripped-down, lush atmospheres found on the Go-Betweens' landmark late-80s albums Tallulah and 16 Lovers Lane. Gone are the masturbatory Coldplay-sized string arrangements that plagued the previous two albums; in are supporting keyboards and intricately layered guitar parts. Songs like <name>McLennan</name>'s somber ""Finding You"" benefit the most from <name>Wallis</name>'s tinkering: Instead of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, <name>Forster</name>'s stark electric lead and <name>McLennan</name>'s delicate ""ah's"" comprise the song's climactic bridge.

    As expected, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> fill every musical nook and cranny with delectable pop melodies, yet even <name>Wallis</name>'s production wizardry can't revive the same enthusiasm and emotional allure in their voices that made subtle songs like ""Bachelor Kisses"" and ""Part Company"" such indelible classics. Yet as awkward as they sometimes sound, the Go-Betweens are still writing consistently gorgeous pop songs, and Oceans Apart proves they aren't content simply pleasing their most die-hard fans; they're back to making albums that, in a better world, appeal to everyone."
4047	18284	This spring <name>Drake</name> picked up the first signee for his newly minted OVO Sound imprint in Toronto-based singer and producer PARTYNEXTDOOR. Like The Weeknd, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and <name>Frank Ocean</name>, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter <name>Lonny Breaux</name> prior to 2011’s Nostalgia, Ultra, PARTYNEXTDOOR had been making cheery EDM-infused R&B under his real name <name>Jahron Brathwaite</name> before starting with a clean slate. <name>Brathwaite</name>’s OVO acquisition was announced with an unassuming track drop on <name>Drake</name>’s October’s Very Own blog. The song, “Make a Mil”, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the <name>Jahron B.</name> material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of Ty Dolla $ign and the Weeknd. The album’s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly lit clubs and private afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of “Relax with Me” that, “Girl yo ass is so instrumental” and noting elsewhere that “Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign”. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&B singer’s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he’s a dead ringer for his boss; “Wus Good/Curious” invokes So Far Gone makeout cuts like “Houstatlantavegas”. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on “Right Now” he essentially affects <name>Meek Mill</name>’s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake “Tbh” and its oscillation between <name>Brathwaite</name>’s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost <name>Drake</name>/Weeknd collaboration. </name>Brathwaite<name>’s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he’s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.PARTYNEXTDOOR abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. “Make a Mil” and closer “Ballin’” both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter undercuts its cavernous low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight “Right Now” revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while “Break from Toronto” bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of Miguel’s “Girl with the Tattoo”. Throughout the album PARTYNEXTDOOR’s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on “Wild Bitches”, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on “Wus Good/Curious”, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of “Make a Mil”) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of “Over Here” and the album’s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry. Jahron <name>Brathwaite</name>’s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He’s got the ear of <name>Drake</name> at a time when the Toronto MC’s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. PARTYNEXTDOOR occasionally works better as an audition for future work with <name>Drake</name> than an expression of <name>Brathwaite</name>’s own aspirations as an artist. But it’s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that PARTYNEXTDOOR is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around Take Care’s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of <name>Drake</name> and <name>Noah “40” Shebib</name>’s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional hip-hop/R&B fusion for parts to restructure it into something new.
15480	2526	"<name>Matthew Dear</name> has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year.  In 2003 alone, he's
    released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International
    label), recorded for <name>Richie Hawtin</name>'s Plus 8 imprint (as False) and <name>Markus Nikolai</name>'s Berlin-based Perlon
    label (as Jabberjaw), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, Leave Luck to Heaven. It's
    no wonder that <name>Dear</name> allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop,
    to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres.

    So, yeah, more eclecticism, then?  Not really, Leave Luck to Heaven is more like alchemy. Instead
    of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of
    ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- Dear boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements
    of his own more catagorizable work.  The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with
    <name>Ricardo Villalobos</name>' Alcachofa) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between
    home listening and the dancefloor.

    Comparisons to <name>Hawtin</name> and <name>Villalobos</name> arguably flatter to deceive at this point in <name>Dear</name>'s career, but
    they're far from unfounded.  In a sense, <name>Dear</name> is creating sounds that blend the same elements that <name>Hawtin</name>
    used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD Decks, EFX & 909. And, like the Chilean
    <name>Villalobos</name>, <name>Dear</name> takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with
    traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear.

    As a result, Leave Luck to Heaven is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners.  Its ebb
    and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps
    things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when <name>Dear</name> stays
    closer to Detroit techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or
    minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"".  Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie
    washes of synths color <name>Dear</name>'s deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and
    release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""You're Fucking Crazy"", each of which twitch and hum with
    hollowed-out nervous energy.

    The vocal tracks, sung in gentle falsetto, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling
    basslines of Detroit's second-wave techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now""
    and ""Dog Days"".  The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition
    and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms
    (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't
    we work it out?"").  ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping
    sing-song of synthetic horns, <name>Dear</name>'s cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell
    another story,"" <name>Dear</name> repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing
    minutes. It could have gone on for another six.  In a year in which <name>Dear has written his share of stories,
    ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter."
368	22336	People die in <name>Nick Cave</name> songs. They get wiped out in floods, zapped in electric chairs, and mowed down en masse in saloon shoot-outs. For <name>Cave</name>, death serves as both a dramatic and rhetorical device—it’s great theater, but it’s also swift justice for those who have done wrong, be it in the eyes of a lover or the Lord. As I once heard him quip in concert: “This next one’s a morality tale… they’re all morality tales, really. It’s what I do.”But despite amassing a songbook that needs its own morgue, on their 16th album together, <name>Nick Cave</name> & the Bad Seeds must contend with something that is not so easily depicted: the sound of mourning. In July 2015, <name>Cave</name>’s 15-year-old son <name>Arthur</name>—one of his twin sons with wife <name>Susie Bick</name>—died when he accidentally fell from a cliff near the family’s current home in Brighton, England. The writing and recording of Skeleton Tree had commenced before the tragic incident, but the album was completed in its aftermath, and its specter hangs over it like a black fog.This is a record that exists in the headspace and guts of someone who’s endured an unspeakable, inconsolable trauma. And though the songs are not explicitly about <name>Arthur</name> they are uncannily about coming to terms with loss and the realization that things will never be the same again. As if to reinforce Skeleton Tree’s therapeutic quality, the notoriously taciturn <name>Cave</name> opened the studio door to director <name>Andrew Dominik</name>, who documented the album’s completion—in 3D, no less—for the companion film One More Time With Feeling. It’s almost as if by thrusting himself into the spotlight during his darkest hour, <name>Cave</name> was issuing a form of karmic payback, penance for the pain and reckoning he’s inflicted on so many characters in his songs.If you try to listen to Skeleton Tree removed from its somber context, the album feels very much like a natural step from 2013’s Push the Sky Away, whose premium on disquieting, ambient textures and wandering-mind lyricism now seems like less like a momentary detour than the gateway into an intriguing new phase for the Bad Seeds. But where that record rallied for show-stopping epics like “Jubilee Street” and “Higgs Boson Blues,” Skeleton Tree’s drones and jitters offer no such moments of release. The skies, seas, and mermaids that previously dominated <name>Cave</name>’s thoughts are still very much present here. But on the opening “Jesus Alone,” he’s wading deeper into the chop, the safety of the shoreline fading further out of view as he gets swept up by pattering drum drifts, humming organs, and swelling orchestration. The song was among the first <name>Cave</name> wrote for the record, yet its opening image—“You fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur”—feels unbearably prescient. It isn’t so much about the finality of death as the ambiguity of the afterlife: <name>Cave</name>’s orator welcomes a litany of souls into purgatory, but his stern proclamation—“With my voice, I am calling you”—makes it unclear whether they’ll be redeemed in heaven or damned to hell.This great unknowing serves as the album’s guiding principle. In <name>Cave</name>’s wounded voice, you hear him grapple in real-time with the incidental prophecies of his lyrics and his need to get the job done. In one of the album’s most harrowing moments, he closes the bleak, grief-stricken ballad “Girl in Amber” by repeating the words, “Don’t touch me,” as if a consoling hug would only exacerbate the pain. Not every song is infused with such omens, but their restlessness is emblematic of the album’s fraught recording process. By Bad Seeds’ standards, “Rings of Saturn” is practically a chillwave song, its dusty drum loop smothered in a soft-focus synth gauze. But <name>Cave</name>’s numbed, sing-speak delivery is laid bare above the smooth texture—not even a cooing chorus of millennial whoops can rouse him. And as surprising as it is to hear a dogged non-conformist like <name>Cave</name> embrace some au courant pop device, here it functions as a faded reminder of a more carefree time—like how, in our most helpless moments, a sentimental song can turn you into a mess.“Rings of Saturn” is one of several tracks on Skeleton Tree where <name>Cave</name> sings about or through an enigmatic female character. Like one of those “Sopranos” episodes where <name>Tony</name> is trapped in his dreams, nothing makes sense on the surface, but every hallucinatory image and mysterious gesture is loaded with circuitous significance. The “woman in a yellow dress surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds” awaiting her call to the pearly gates in “Jesus Alone” could very well be the one at the center of “Magneto,” whose quivering atmospherics and panting delivery suggest a goth Astral Weeks. “It was the year I officially became the bride of Jesus,” <name>Cave</name> intones, before blithely revealing, “The urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming/I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.” But that prosaic setting is revisited from a different vantage in the parched-throat synth-pop serenade “I Need You,” where the crestfallen narrator sings, “I saw you standing there in the supermarket with your red dress, falling, and your eyes are to the ground,” as if observing a woman he once loved but no longer recognizes in her current distressed state.And yet even the relentless ache of “I Need You”—the closest <name>Cave</name> has come to actually crying on record—hardly prepares you for a pair of closing tracks that will reduce the most hardened hearts to puddles. “Distant Sky” may initially come on like a simple invitation to escape (“Let us go now, my one true love/Call the gasman, cut the power off!”), but once the divine Danish vocalist <name>Else Torp</name> emerges, the song elevates to a form of secular last rites. Musically, “Distant Sky” is all soothing organ tones and celestial orchestration, but the song’s weightlessness is utterly crushing, as <name>Cave</name> crystallizes the mood of Skeleton Tree in one trembling, devastating line: “They told us our gods would outlive us/But they lied.”By contrast, the lilting gospel sway of the final title track feels more earthbound. It’s an attempt to step out of the void and reconnect with the waking world while recognizing that grieving doesn’t happen on a standard timeline—you don’t just hole yourself up for three months of weeping and then emerge fully recovered. Grief is a wraith of love that haunts your soul, emerging when you least expect it from the most mundane triggers and surroundings. “I call out, right across the sea,” <name>Cave</name> sings, “but the echo comes back empty.” However, the darkness has at least acquired enough definition for <name>Cave</name> to make out a path forward. The last line <name>Cave</name> sings on the album is “It’s all right now,” less a declaration of closure than an acceptance it may never come. 
1526	21065	"It was bound to happen. As more and more bands in the extended <name>Bon Iver</name> family have made use of <name>Justin Vernon</name>’s April Base studio in the tiny village of Fall Creek, Wis., the location and the sensibilities of the musicians who overlap on these releases (and sleep there in bunk beds while recording) have begun to create a distinct sound. April Base seems like a place you’d find locally made art on the walls, <name>Bruce Hornsby</name> on the turntable, and half-eaten bags of trail mix on the counters. In the same way <name>Matthew E. White</name>'s Spacebomb house band stamps its records with vintage-horn-section grandiosity, April Base recordings tend to have a liquid, woodsy aura like the one <name>Vernon</name> debuted on <name>Bon Iver</name> in 2011.  Enter <name>Doe Paoro</name>, who turned heads with her smoky, soulful voice on 2012 debut Slow to Love, which she wrote on a <name>Vernon</name>-esque cabin retreat outside Syracuse, N.Y. Though she didn’t know <name>Vernon</name>, when it came time to record a new batch of songs, she reached out to him, and he ended up producing her single ""The Wind"" and also introduced her to the production team of <name>S. Carey</name> and <name>BJ Burton</name>, who has produced, engineered, or mixed several others in the extended family (Carey, Volcano Choir, <name>Colin Stetson</name>, Megafaun). <name>Burton</name>, who also produced Low’s recent Ones and Sixes in Wisconsin, wisely realized it wouldn’t make sense to give Low the heavy duty cycle of April Base’s sonic wash, which can be dialed up (Repave) or down (Range of Light). For After, <name>Doe Paoro</name> gets the full-on <name>Wilson Phillips</name>-in-the-woods treatment. It fits her just right.A lot of the conversation surrounding <name>Paoro</name> (real name <name>Sonia Kreitzer</name>) has focused on her time in Tibet and her study of Lhamo, an ancient form of Tibetan folk opera. But rather than a direct influence on her sound, <name>Lhamo</name> seems to represent one of the many ways <name>Doe</name> experiments with form. On After, she’s not tied to a specific song structure or genre just as she’s not easily described by one type of vocal tradition. Vintage and modern R&B, soul, <name>Fiona Apple</name>, and '80s synth-pop all commingle. When <name>Paoro</name> originally released ""Traveling"", it was a minimalist performance video with just <name>Paoro</name> on vocals and <name>Guy Blakeslee</name> of the Entrance Band on guitar, but on After, the guitar is subbed for coughing woodwinds, muted synths, and processed keys. ""Silence can be so loud, it’s abrasive,"" she sings, countering any preconceived, romantic notion of isolation. Holing up in a cabin can block out the din of humanity, but that withdrawal can also amplify your own thoughts, making them louder than you ever imagined. ""I wanted solitude and that’s what I got/ Now I’m a living island with only one thought: Maybe I was wrong,"" she sings as organ and the April Base horn section swell and those ""In the Air Tonight"" drums kick in.Either version of ""Traveling"" is a winner, and that malleability makes <name>Doe Paoro</name> something special. While there’s a familiarity to the production of <name>Carey</name> and <name>Burton</name>, the backdrops they create for <name>Paoro</name> are experimental and filled with surprises. Drums disappear as quickly as they appear. Pulsing bass drives ""Nostalgia"", while the patiently paced ""Outlines"" finds <name>Paoro</name> alone with a piano, pausing between bluesy phrases and relishing her chance to take center stage as a damaged but defiant torch singer. As much as the producers and collection of studio musicians imprint After, their influence wouldn’t allow just any songwriter to shine. <name>Paoro</name>, alongside co-writers like <name>Peter Morén</name> and <name>Adam Rhodes</name>, uses the album to reckon with loss and all of its implications, especially as it relates to time—knowing that you’re knee-deep in the aftermath, but not yet on the precipice of something else. The future is a bunch of white space, neither something to get excited about nor dread. So what do you do with the present? Well, for one, you don’t dwell on the past. ""Nostalgia is killing us,"" <name>Paoro</name> sings. And on ""Hypotheticals"", she realizes questions like ""What’s fair?"" aren’t even worth answering. ""I won’t indulge in hypotheticals,"" she spits out in a blast, turning something that could be a tossed-off sound bite from an <name>Aaron Sorkin</name> drama into a charged, anthemic refusal to let someone else change her story. Making peace with something as painful as loss is a messy task. After is a confident, beautiful, clear-eyed testament to that mess."

    In many ways, 1967 was year zero for the world we live in
    today. From Detroit to Nigeria to Jerusalem
    to Paris to Southeast Asia,
    it was a year of cataclysms and upheaval. Dozens of American cities burned that
    summer, the
    United States of America lost more than 11,000 soldiers in Vietnam, the draft was in
    full force, and protestors showed up at the Pentagon in October, chanting ""Hey,
    hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel
    seized the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights in the Six Days' War, and we're still reading
    the consequences in headlines every day.
    It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of
    today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie
    dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the
    Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North
    Vietnam, of <name>Hendrix</name> kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race
    riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the
    Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of
    color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five
    other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed
    that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a
    flood. 1967 saw Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
    Hearts' Club Band, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,
    Velvet Underground & Nico, Are You Experienced?, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other
    records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before.
    Funny, I didn't mention Motown or anything affiliated with
    it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year
    came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, 2,000
    buildings burned to the ground in Detroit
    during the 12th Street
    riot. Forty-three people died and more than 7,000 were arrested. The National Guard and
    the 82nd Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back
    to the city. The 82nd Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the
    Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since
    1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet.

     <name>Berry Gordy</name>'s operating philosophy had always been to create
    a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of
    creating that environment meant that Motown was essentially an
    around-the-clock, 24-7 operation. There was almost never a time when something
    wasn't happening in the Snake Pit studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But
    during the riots, the studio and offices closed for six whole days. As with the
    automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City
    limits to the Detroit
    suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as
    well.

    Given the context, it's something to listen to the music
    that the company produced that year. Hip-O Select's ongoing series of
    comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released A- and B-sides, as well as a
    few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier
    volumes were liberally sprinkled with musical outliers, this one is almost
    terrifyingly focused on the Motown Sound, a certifiable and unmistakable
    aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at Motown was fully aware
    of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love
    lost that come from a wholesome America
    that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.

    It's blindingly obvious why people bought and loved and
    danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: They're great songs, social
    context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the
    rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get
    behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,
    originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even
    as everything else changed. Partly thanks to Motown, by 1967, anything could
    hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by
    artists of all races.

    The label's biggest act, the Supremes, opened the year smack
    in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the
    Holland-Dozier-Holland production and writing team was so deep in its groove
    that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point
    was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of
    course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an H-D-H job for
    the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a
    tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics
    are a kaleidoscope of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in
    teardrops, mirrors and window panes.

    H-D-H also had the Four Tops firing on all cylinders in 67.
    ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with  <name>Levi Stubbs</name>' crazed, heavily
    syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an
    amazing Northern stomper called ""I Got a Feeling"" that could stop a
    mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to
    Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music
    was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with  <name>Berry Gordy</name> was hotter. They, the
    three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown
    Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and
    they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.

    Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of
    the year as well.  <name>Mickey Stevenson</name>, <name>Kim Weston</name>, and <name>Clarence
    Paul</name>, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours
    made their last recording for the label, with <name>Dennis Edwards</name> on lead vocals,
    passing through the group's ranks on his way to taking <name>David Ruffin</name>'s place in
    the Temptations the following year. <name>Flo Ballard</name> was edged out of the Supremes
    in favor of <name>Cindy Birdsong</name>, and by the end of the year they were officially
    <name>Diana Ross</name> & the Supremes.

    Where <name>Lamont Dozier</name> and the Holland brothers created a vacuum, <name>Norman Whitfield</name> moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his
    personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I
    Need"", a rocket made of harmony, brought in majestic strings on the fluttering
    slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and made one of pop music's all-time sad
    masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine
    anguish of <name>Rodger Penzabene</name>'s lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,
    wounded and fragile. <name>Penzabene</name>, who lived that song every day, took his own
    life soon after the single was released. Whitfield, along with frequent
    co-writer <name>Barrett Strong</name>, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the
    Grapevine"", recorded by <name>Marvin Gaye</name> early in the year. This version was shelved
    by <name>Berry Gordy</name>, though, and <name>Whitfield</name> took it to <name>Gladys Knight</name> & the Pips,
    who in turn took it to #2 pop, #1 r&b.

    Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were
    newcomers <name>Nickolas Ashford</name> and <name>Valerie Simpson</name>. The two clearly understood the
    Motown aesthetic, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was
    perfect for the dueting talents of <name>Marvin Gaye</name> and <name>Tammi Terrell</name>. In 1967, they
    gave <name>Gaye</name> and <name>Terrell</name> two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No
    Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two
    voices and the effortless smoothness of the <name>Ashford</name>/<name>Simpson</name> production combined
    to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: <name>Terrell</name> collapsed into <name>Gaye</name>'s
    arms at a concert and wound up in a hospital, diagnosed with a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her
    life in 1970 at the age of 24.

    Others came to the label in different ways. <name>Edwin Starr</name>, a
    bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when <name>Gordy</name> bought Ric-Tic, the label
    <name>Starr</name> was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap <name>Starr</name>'s
    potential, but his debut for the <name>Gordy</name> imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was
    spectacular even if it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found
    true focus, there were still a few anomalies. The Underdogs, a raw, talented
    garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the
    roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the
    Funk Brothers, including bassist <name>James Jamerson</name>, are on the track, but you
    wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer <name>Dave Whitehouse</name>'s powerful lead
    is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.

    Other musical tangents are tamer. <name>Gordy</name> was still messing
    around with crooners <name>Billy Eckstine</name> and <name>Barbara McNair</name>, though neither ever
    went anywhere on his label. The Messengers were kind of a jangly pop-rock band
    in a West Coast vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording
    of the <name>Ashford</name> & <name>Simpson</name> classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown
    artists in the coming years. The Messengers' A-side was written by <name>R. Dean
    Taylor</name>, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost
    in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some
    perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal.

    Several Motown mainstays quietly had good years. <name>Smokey
    Robinson</name> & the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,
    while <name>Stevie Wonder</name> wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""
    and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". <name>Brenda Holloway</name> cut the original
    version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it pales next to ""Just Look What
    You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still
    features a poised and powerful vocal.

    The year 1967 was <name>Muhammed Ali</name> refusing to serve after being drafted,
    acid in San Francisco,
    400 million viewers around the world tuning in via satellite as the Beatles
    performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and <name>Thurgood Marshall</name> taking his seat as the
    first African-American on the Supreme Court, a court that had just ruled state
    laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was Operation Rolling Thunder and the Six Days' War
    and Biafra and student demonstration time. But
    it was also Martha & the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the
    front, the dignified sadness of <name>Roger Penzabene</name>, the amazing sound of <name>Tammi Terrell</name>'s voice blended with <name>Marvin Gaye</name>'s, <name>Uriel Jones</name> and <name>Pistol Allen</name> on the
    drum kit, <name>James Jamerson</name> on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered
    up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.
    You'd never guess 1967 was Motown's year until you listen to the year Motown
    had in 1967. The music is hard to beat.

    and mimicry (<name>Scorsese</name>, <name>Cassavetes</name>, and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece.
    Western Keys frontman <name>Ben Dickey</name> is also a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (<name>Oberst</name>, <name>Brock</name>,
    and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece. <name>Anderson</name>'s recent relationship-centric
    film Punch Drunk Love manages to be overwrought as it underreaches, but it also offers a zesty
    acknowledgement of the mysteries we are to ourselves. <name>Dickey</name>'s new relationship-centric Damage EP
    also under-overs, but the project is in sore need of mystery.

    Hailing from Austin, Texas, where the self-mythologizing scene was supposed to be bifurcated into the dusty
    middle-aged singer/songwriter in a button-up shirt camp and the <name>Roky Erickson</name>/<name>Daniel Johnston</name>
    amenable-nutjob/aberration-prodigy camp, Western Keys is an exciting proposition, the rare nephew of Uncle
    Tupelo that propels rather than deflates. The four-piece band's debut throws down a warm, seven-track
    country-then-rock-then-punk-then-pop sampler, a gourmet smorgasbord crammed into a kindergarten snack pack.
    Homesick keyboards lead into humbly exquisite brush drums. Meandering steel guitars give way to slaughterhouse
    indie-rock solos (this whisper/kaboom tactic makes ""Driver Denies"" one of the top sneak-up-on-you jams of
    the season). Think heavy-pastoral. Think rock-out-with-your-flock-out.

    But hell, who are these people? Are they R.E.M. getting carjacked by Yo La Tengo outside of a That Dog yard
    sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they
    Appendix Out's warbly asses premeditating their quivers-n-mumbles-n-wails, but grounded in love-doom (""Free"")?
    Are they a dumber, pre-pubescent <name>Jonathan Richman</name> crooning about how ""all my friends/ And my best friend/
    Sleeps with all my fucking girlfriends,"" as if the line were a comedically earnest epic message of global
    insight (""Laughter"")? Or is this just Pinkerton-era Weezer and pouty <name>Matt Pond</name> PA teaming up in a
    suburban basement?

    Tread patiently: <name>Dickey</name>'s voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal
    that Drainage seemed like a better title, and the shimmer/crunch production suggested that the dread genre
    of emo-fi was being born. Very soon, though, <name>Dickey</name> gets to yellin' and the band gets to shining-- not that
    they entirely shed their sense of preciousness. One could argue that Damage is juvenile and microcosmic
    in the best way, but these folks could use some more expansive lyrics to avoid seeming mired in prolonged
    adolescence. ""I don't love you anymore"" this and ""it's over"" that, Western Keys could apply its impressively
    shrugged-off harmonies to more than emotional dandruff. <name>Dickey</name>'s band perpetuates the conundrum of the
    Americana: does that word connote music that is vast/universal or solipsistic/self-interested? Probably
    both, if that genre includes both <name>Bob Dylan</name> and <name>Ryan Adams</name>. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their
    awkward <name>Kirk Cameron</name> stage fast, because they might be onto something big."
5894	16183	" Chairlift's second full-length, Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer <name>Caroline Polachek</name> has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and <name>Polachek</name> has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic relationships and the evolution of character.Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit ""Bruises"" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member <name>Aaron Pfennins</name> split with the group after his romantic relationship with <name>Polachek</name> ended. (He now has an atmospheric disco project called Rewards.) Now a duo, <name>Polachek</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Patrick Wimberly</name> have a different chemistry. <name>Wimberly</name>, a producer on several Das Racist tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits <name>Polachek</name>'s voice and melodies. As a result, Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.<name>Polachek</name>'s presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that potential liability into a strength on two of Something's most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling wry lyrics without getting too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of <name>Robert Smith</name>-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's <name>Christine McVie</name>-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in ""Sidewalk Safari"" or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", <name>Polachek</name> sounds totally comfortable and in control.Though it's obvious that <name>Polachek</name> is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to Something's success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on Something are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" <name>Polachek</name> still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.The song on Something that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop. "
3454	18941	"The question of whether <name>Marissa Nadler</name>'s elegant folk music ought to soundtrack our dreams or haunt our nightmares has been a thread through her uncannily cohesive catalogue. With six albums in 10 years and never a misstep, <name>Nadler</name> has grown her own perceptive language—she's an old-soul lost in time like <name>Sibylle Baier</name>, but her music is blackened and more literary. Her songs have come steeped in misery and macabre, cobwebs and ashes, but <name>Nadler</name> is not a doomy aesthete merely for gloom's sake. She is devoted to <name>Leonard Cohen</name> and <name>Joni Mitchell</name>, and her music understands folk tradition. While her songs sound isolated and spiritually vintage, as if beamed from the grayscale interior of a Victorian home, her stories have been generous, selfless tales, heavy with metaphor and imagery. <name>Nadler</name>'s poetic temperament and steady grace point to a darkness within us all—though her singing always seems to hone on mortality not for the purpose of crushing, existential missives, but in order to protect us.Each of <name>Nadler</name>'s albums has signaled subtle evolution. After channeling a bewitched <name>Hope Sandoval</name> and establishing a gothic heart, her sound became gorgeous and nuanced on 2007's III, broke from the freak-folk tag on 2009's astounding Little Hells, and incorporated sing-song <name>Gillian Welch</name>-inspired country pop on 2011's gleaming <name>Marissa Nadler</name>. Still, she has never let her dark essence slip away—this is a singer whose first record mixed traditional English balladry with an arrangement of <name>Edgar Allen Poe</name>'s ""Annabelle Lee"" and a song about the death of <name>Virginia Woolf</name>. ""I once was young and I once was strong,"" she sang then, in 2004, at age 23 on ""Box of Cedar"". <name>Nadler</name>'s music has been tinged by country blues and murder balladry, by people who died alone and old loves who creep her memory. But empathy has defined her work. See, for example, <name>Nadler</name>’s tender treatment of the recurring figure <name>Mayflower May</name>, a lonely and reflective old woman, or the 20th-century siamese twin circus performers <name>Daisy</name> and <name>Violet</name> (2011's spellbinding ""Daisy, Where Did You Go?"" explores what happened to <name>Violet</name> when <name>Daisy</name> died first, an especially harrowing piece of historical subject matter).<name>Nadler</name>'s self-described ""dreadfully shy"" wallflower persona fits in well with these earlier records, filled with swaths of muted color and third-person characters. July is another side of <name>Marissa Nadler</name>; if she sounded older back on Little Hells, <name>Nadler</name> is younger and bolder now, in confessional mode. Here are intimately personal accounts of misread desire, an empty heart set by winter blues, and years wasted on a lover who could do no right. ""I called you when I was drunk all the time,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings on the quiet, finger-picked ""Holiday In"", stranded on a mountain in winter, recalling a depleted love. This is the ""beer/thank-you"" of <name>Nadler</name>'s new honest approach. ""I'd rather watch crime TV than see you again,"" she sings. It is a shocking but humanizing charm to hear <name>Nadler</name> reference even basic technologies in song. More so than any of <name>Nadler</name>'s records, July is a self-knowing and zenlike advocate of change; ""I know better now/ I don't get as high,"" she sings on the intensely detailed breakup song ""Firecrackers,"" pointing blame at herself as she steadies her own romantic mess of ghosts and lovers.July is more tactile thanks to new producer <name>Randall Dunn</name>, best known for his work with metal bands such as Earth, Sunn O))), and Wolves in the Throne Room. (<name>Dunn</name> has also worked on folkier projects for Akron/Family and Six Organs of Admittance, but <name>Nadler</name> has ties to the black metal community, having collaborated with Xasthur and Locrian.) The pairing befits <name>Nadler</name>'s sound. Like black metal, her songs are atmospheric, austere, and engulfing. At times, <name>Nadler</name>'s resonant acoustic strums are coated thick, as if emboldened by the deep ebony outline of a Sharpie marker. Her gothic touchstones return more deliberately melodic, and the audible strength of her voice lends to a more idiosyncratic sound; even the quiet acoustic songs and piano ballad sound like they are set up on-stage. There are textured synths and the occasional electric guitar underneath, and the dramatic orchestral strings that underpin ""1923"" offer the song a sense of grandeur—""I called you from another century/ To see if the world had been kind and sweet,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, offering not just an impressionistic line but a pointed one that sums up an essential idea about her work. It's <name>Nadler</name>'s stacked, carefully pronounced harmonies, though, that really make these songs stand so tall.The forward movement of July can be entrancing and propulsive: ""Drive"" and ""I've Got Your Name"" are evocative Americana road songs, the former cast with a cruel road-weary disaffection that she medicates naturally: ""Still remember all the words/ To every song you ever heard,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, conjuring more direct, intuitive emotions than usual. There are grittier details here, too: ""Changed in a rest-stop into my dress/ Made sure not to touch the floor/ I've done that kind of thing before,"" she sings from the side of the I-95. <name>Nadler</name> always sounds like a journeying soul poet, but here she makes her rootless experience clear, as on the piercing ""Holiday In"": ""You have a girl in every state/ I know I'm in the way.""""Dead City Emily"" is July's hypnotic centerpiece, the realization of <name>Nadler</name> and <name>Dunn</name>'s work at the stone-cold polar vortex of folk structure and doom metal mood. <name>Nadler</name>'s rain-streaked music has an overcast glow here, one that comes with a first snowfall, the realism of dead leaves and paralyzing ice. <name>Nadler</name> has few direct contemporaries—<name>Bill Callahan</name>, <name>Sharon Van Etten</name>, or <name>Alela Diane</name> come to mind—but here, on July's most extreme song, she could sensibly share bills with, say, Iceage or Deafheaven. The song’s fictional conversation is made of inner-strife, trapped in a devil town and a dead-end love, jaded towards the innate beauty of trees or birds—images <name>Nadler</name> has used throughout her songbook. <name>Nadler</name> typically speaks through female figures, and while there is struggle in this exchange, there is also power, like she is teaching another woman or warning her in secret. July's stories are rich with such wisdom."
10322	11370	"Lead singer <name>Honus Honus</name> kicks off Man Man's third album with the line ""Been locked down way too long,"" and he ain't kidding. Despite the temptation to revere/revile the Philly band as a homogenous curio, people forget Man Man's comprised of real people with real emotions. Forget the porn 'staches and Zappa/Beefheart/Waits funhouse gags, 2006's Six Demon Bag was, at the end of the day, an incredibly poignant confessional. In between three-ring antics, <name>Honus</name> lost his heart (and shit) over and over again, most memorably on the standout ballad ""Van Helsing Boombox"", pining to ""sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet."" Fast forward to Rabbit Habits and you'll find <name>Honus</name> still howling like a dog, but of a different breed. Dubbed by the band as their ""pop record,"" Habits knows that sex sells, and suddenly Man Man's starting to sound less archaic. Habits's steady rock swagger and listener-friendly songwriting stands to convert haters while also retaining the band's beloved quirks: You won't need to rent Fiddler on the Roof or own a hurdy gurdy to appreciate this record, just a libido and willingness to rock out.
    There's a tendency for a band's maturation to deep-six most their unqiue tics, but Man Man pull a <name>Houdini</name> by releasing an album that simultaneously showcases them at their most cogent and carefree. Unlike past albums, there's not so much garage sale rummaging as search and destroy songwriting. The band's dedicated to nailing certain ideas within the allotted track time and often does so. As a result, we get ""Mister Jung Stuffed"" and ""Top Drawer"", two of Man Man's most single-ready works and the finest entry points for Habits. The latter's particularly jarring, not only because of its confrontational lyrics and brothel boogie, but also for its stark contrast to the romantically waylaid Honus of Six Demon Bag: ""People claim I'm possessed by the devil/ But Mama, I know I'm possessed by your daughter!""
    Throughout the record, <name>Honus</name> focuses less on himself than a rogue's gallery of offbeat  characters. ""Hurly/Burly"" tells the tale of a pair of fuckups at odds with society, replete with two refrains of existential screams and the hushed mid-song disclaimer ""This ain't no love song."" That street urchin angst spills over into ""The Ballad of Butter Beans"", where <name>Honus</name> makes death threats to the title character over a Looney Tunes xylophone. In a testament to their refined craftmanship, the debauchery comes full circle by the eight-minute ""Poor Jackie"", an emotionally dampened gypsy stomp that turns a cold shoulder to its star-crossed subject: ""I don't see what everybody/ Sees in your sexy body/ All I see is a shallow grave/ Trapped inside a pretty face."" By the song's conclusion, the band practically dances on her grave, calling out a boisterous horn section before launching into a capella mock gospel and declaring, ""There ain't no God here.""
Habits has little to apologize for, no serious blemishes or ill-advised shifts in direction. So why does it fall a hair short of Six Demon Bag, despite being a more cohesive effort? Partly because organization doesn't quite suit Man Man, but moreso because Habits sounds tailored for the stage. Even intimate ballads like ""Doo Right"" and the title track seem more like bellyaching than <name>Honus</name> coming apart at the seams. Still, what we've lost in a bedroom companion we've gained in one of the year's best rock albums (devoid of nearly any guitar parts, mind you). After making a case for melancholy hobo rock, Man Man's not begging for quarters or kisses anymore. Like a vagabond stumbling upon a sack of gold, they're now ready to hit the town and live a little."

    <name>Marc Ribot</name> is tough to put your finger on. He's a left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a collaborator; to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is unpredictable is an understatement. He's done
    everything from straightforward rock to no wave to his own spin on
    Latin music in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent <name>Tom Waits</name> and worked with <name>John Zorn</name>, <name>Elvis Costello</name>, <name>Alison Kraus</name>, <name>Foetus</name>, <name>Wilson</name>
    <name>Pickett</name>, and <name>Allen Ginsberg</name>, among many others.
    This latest album (roughly his 19th) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name> and drummer <name>Ches Smith</name>, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his
    most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. <name>Ribot</name> pokes a
    bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that
    Ceramic Dog is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and
    ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly
    distorted and bastardized cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the
    original's riff has been forcefully molded into a warped funk-punk groove.
    It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that makes
    it seem pretty natural that the noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit
    just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name
    with wry spoken vocals and a Latin lounge beat. While ""Kitsch""
    is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise
    before finally going somewhere, too late to make a difference. <name>Ribot</name> has shown
    in the past that the line between pushing the envelope and outsmarting yourself
    can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that
    line.

    <name>Ribot</name>'s past dips into Latin rock hybrids are traceable on
    certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back
    cumbia feel that replaces the usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps
    the rhythm reserved. The verses are separated by a cool horn arrangement that
    sounds vaguely Balkan, and the track come off as
    similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with <name>Tom Waits</name>. It's
    amazing the way the band just plows through anything he can cook up for it.
    ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping Spanish-language dance track
    ""Pinch"", a punk disco number that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent
    guitar solo.

    I think the best term to describe the record
    as a whole is ""schizophonic."" Every time you think the band has settled on
    psychedelic disco or blistering avant-noise, they throw another curve at you.
    ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise
    piece that reminds me of something <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> might have done on his own in
    the mid-1990s-- it's compelling in its decrepitude and just about the polar
    opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". The risk of experimentation is failure,
    and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""Digital Handshake"" and
    the listless free rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its
    variety sometimes translates to inconsistency, though, Party Intellectuals is a generally interesting listen and could
    even work as a nice introduction to <name>Ribot</name>'s work as a leader for the way it
    runs so much of his gamut.

13814	1808	"There's a state of mind in which infancy and mortality meet. Death,
    its inexorability, and our fear of it render us as helpless as when we were
    toddlers. Many of us fill the resulting tremulous mental gap with
    religion (""our Father...""); others with work, love, or grown-up
    childishness like golf; and you and I, perhaps, with pop music. Cloud
    Cult bandleader <name>Craig Minowa</name> is obsessed with this space-- with
    infancy, mortality, and, alas, infant mortality-- and his grandiose
    fourth album, Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus, occupies it
    with messy, expansive, computer-ok indie rock.
    I'm often captivated by bands that find quirky beauty in modest
    everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's
    Aurora Borealis, but here they more often aim for lofty
    apotheosis: for The Moon and Antarctica, Odelay, or the
    Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. Advice from the Happy
    Hippopotamus is utterly over the top, starting with its title and
    ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard
    souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will
    find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an
    intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire
    emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with
    solid tunes.
    It's tempting to call <name>Minowa</name>, an organic farmer from the Minnesota
    wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts <name>Isaac Brock</name>
    yelp and <name>Conor Oberst</name> quaver, his CDs made of recycled materials, his
    home studio geothermally powered. He has the perverse confidence to
    open Advice with a wordless industrial freakout and bury the
    album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's
    Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. Title track ""Happy Hippo""
    buzzes like the Chemical Brothers, twinkles like a fairytale and boinks
    like a video game before recklessly pilfering from Neil Young's ""Hey
    Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my
    matt-uh-russ."")
    The album's sprawl is dizzying: Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate
    guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for
    ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The
    Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the tearjerker chamber-pop of
    ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man
    Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on
    the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like
    Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night, Advice
    also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker
    ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like
    ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one
    song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by
    <name>Mara Stemm</name>. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed
    Your Car"" scatters <name>Oberst</name>'s Digital Ash like so much cigarette
    ash (burn!).
    Flesh is a recurring theme. Does the human essence persist after its
    shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for
   <name>Minowa</name>, whose infant son died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose
    spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,""
    <name>Minowa</name> sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin""
    attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling
    guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation
    and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately
    off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence
    with the unaffected joy of a dancing toddler.
    Like a little boy or a crazed genius, <name>Minowa</name> isn't afraid to look
    silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy
    world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of <name>Minowa</name>
    hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are
    alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass--
    a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully
    cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of
    ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy."
2943	19393	"Despite their name, Serpentine Path have never entailed very much winding, at least as far their music is concerned. Sure, the members took separate, circuitous paths to arrive in the New York all-star quintet, with individual stops in Electric Wizard, Unearthly Trance, Ramesses and the Howling Wind along the way; by definition, that’s true of most every supergroup. But on their self-titled 2012 debut, Serpentine Path showcased an unwavering focus, marching through eight barbaric bits of doom at very low tempos and with very little distraction. They occasionally decorated songs with spooky samples as preludes and sometimes let guitarist <name>Tim Bagshaw</name> step out of rhythmic lockstep for slow, swollen solos. Mostly, though, they pressed ahead, with <name>Ryan Lipynsky</name>’s bellicose rasp peeking through the band’s deliberate plod, a dim lantern lighting the way through a darkened forest. In spite of the extensive résumés of those involved, Serpentine Path established a purpose and pursued it doggedly, avoiding the most general pitfall of veteran talent aggregates: indecision.In the last two years, Serpentine Path haven’t veered from that course, but they have added a fifth member and second guitarist, Winter co-founder <name>Stephen Flam</name>. On Emanations, <name>Flam</name> lends finesse to that focus, giving their doom a new depth. <name>Flam</name> refuses to mirror or retrench the burl of <name>Bagshaw</name>’s riffs; instead, they work together to add underlying layers to the brood, with lines of dissonant squeal and sordid distortion peeling off of the group’s headlong direction. The distinction becomes clear only a minute in to Emanations, when a brief break in <name>Lipynsky</name>’s arrogant agitation allows the guitars to split at the seams—one snarling and thin, the other thick and suffocating. For Serpentine Path, <name>Flam</name> introduces a new element of the unknown, and the established group responds in kind for the entire album. They disrupt rhythms where they once would have stayed in time, and they break patterns that, only two years ago, felt settled. If Serpentine Path were a declaration of intent, Emanations is an attempt to steer clear of its rut, to make sure that the supergroup’s core doesn’t become deadweight.Serpentine Path haven't given up on doom, or even steered from it, really. These seven songs still feel like leaden hammers swung by giants. “Disfigured Colossus” is enormous and odd, grisly guitar tones twisted over an imposing rhythm section. “Torment” is an italicized attack, its mid-tempo lurch aiming ever ahead. Throughout Emanations, though, Serpentine Path find subtle, compelling ways to scatter that power, to accompany their force so it never seems to be the sole purpose. “Treacherous Waters”, for instance, flips between an insistent lumber and double-kick bursts, the switches in tempo reinforcing the dour temperament of <name>Lipynsky</name>’s lyrics. “Drawn into the depths,” he bellows after one of those changeups, the band surging beneath him. “Vacant incantations.” And “Torment"", that closing fisticuff, zigs and zags, pushing through a bridge bent by a bleary-eyed guitar soliloquy and ending with glorious guitar harmonies. That push and pull between insurgence and excursions is most evident on “Systematic Extinction”, a fetching stoner anthem that moves Serpentine Path the farthest afield from their stylistic center that they’ve ever been. <name>Flam</name> and <name>Bagshaw</name> step out for solos between every verse and chorus, lysergic tones spinning into a slow, psychedelic pinwheel. With its stack of refrains and bridges, pregnant stop-time pauses and careful crescendo crest, it’s the most consciously crafted song in Serpentine Path’s catalogue.On a song like “Systematic Extinction”, you can feel Serpentine Path pressing against their previous limitations by folding their members’ respective experiences back into their own stylistic rubric. More often than not, supergroups seem to take the opposite tack, starting from the ideas that made the musicians successful in the past and, with time, possibly finding a distinction all their own. On their debut, Serpentine Path decided how they would sound and what they would ply; on Emanations, they’ve used that starting point as a real beginning, the origin of a path from which they can move off and on at will.

14317	7791	"Gosh does liking music make you feel prematurely old! Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even Blind Mr. Jones! A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of Pavement records-- I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: Packing up the 90s for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? Some reappraisal is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. As popular as the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as My Bloody Valentine. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, Slowdive is the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue.

    These days we all know that, in the end, Slowdive were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: There's something in this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. Listening to Catch the Breeze-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- you get an immediate sense of why. Frontman <name>Neil Halstead</name>'s songs have a narcotic languor to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate haze of this stuff-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. It's like watching film in slow motion: Everything goes watery-dreamy, but it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through every stage of their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of melody, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. People try it with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this.

    So three albums, two discs. The draw for longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's earliest singles. This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional rock band-- albeit a huge, deep, and sleepy one, with <name>Halstead</name> and <name>Rachel Goswell</name> already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of Souvlaki), including a Peel Session cover of <name>Syd Barrett</name>'s ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, Just for a Day, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's Souvlaki. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as Loveless, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way <name>Halstead</name>'s exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, dreamlike slow motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with <name>Brian Eno</name>-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments.

    Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by <name>Halstead</name>, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom <name>Simon Reynolds</name> coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, Pygmalion, has come to seem like the best thing <name>Halstead</name> has been involved with. The highlight, ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the price of any collection anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly pretty things you'll ever hear, milking incredible pathos from a shuffling drum loop, sparkling touches of guitar, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even further, constructing another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. Catch the Breeze nicks a full five songs from Pygmalion, an album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: This LP can be criminally hard to find.

    And that's Slowdive, in a handy two-disc set, packed and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a quintessential Slowdive-listening experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; you drift comfortably off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- so massive, so intensively vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. It's like taking a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, alarmingly drugged-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home."
3811	18596	"A little more than a decade after Deadringer came out, there's enough music—and enough attempts at reconfiguring his style—to help you construct a picture of how all over the map RJD2's career has been. Whether it's a clear picture is another thing entirely; his shift from underground rap production next big thing to muddled indie-pop singer-songwriter to studio-bound funkateer has done a lot to confuse any set-in-stone ideas of what the RJD2 sound was or is supposed to be. His partnership with <name>Aaron Livingston</name> as Icebird seemed like a good first step towards a reconciliation of everything RJ had built up in his portfolio over the previous ten years or so. But it also opened the door for a big “now what?"" and the hesitant anticipation of future work that could build on the idea of an all-encompassing, canonical RJD2 musical identity.And now, for what feels like the first time in his career, RJ has released an album that comes across as a successful culmination of all his previous ideas and experiments rather than simply a new shift in style.. The title of More Is Than Isn't says as much; these are established trademarks and tics—bombastic drum breaks, sunshine-gleam brass, an armada of mothership synthesizers—that definitely sound like they came from the same hands that Deadringer, Since We Last Spoke and The Colossus did. But it's that first album's boom-bap crate-digging, its follow-up's prog-funk ambition, and his most recent album's cartoon neo-soul all streamlined into an overarching sound, with all the <name>Pavlov</name> triggers and odd quirks and over-the-top crests that combination implies.With this album uniting everything that made RJ RJ over the years, it establishes a definitive place for him after all this time: that of the hip-hop-inflected neo-soul fusionist producer who is just as comfortable working in moods as genres. With his instrumentals, it's as though he's working more in potential-soundtrack mode than anything; it's easier to describe his beats nowadays for what montages or scenes they could evoke rather than where their component parts could place them demographically. You can definitely dance to a lot of it: the Isley-flecked groove of “Behold, Numbers!” extends this summer's disco-funk revivalism into early fall, “Winter Isn't Coming” goes all neon-space-pyramid with high-BPM footwork-jostling bongo breaks, and the <name>Rick Rubin</name>-oid, Mellotron/piano/space-laser breakdown showcase “Her Majesty's Socialist Request” has already proven through its video to be a killer b-boy/b-girl anthem.The vocal cuts are both a bit less frequent and a fair amount stronger than in his last couple records. There are a couple strong rap tracks, with emerging Columbus art-rapper <name>P. Blackk</name> rolling out fluid doubletime boasts over the Southern bounce-style “Bathwater” and old Soul Position partner Blueprint harnessing some of that vintage “Final Frontier” smoothness into nimble heist-metaphor storytelling for the Meters-go-caper-flick soul twang of “It All Came to Me in a Dream”. And while RJ does lend that hesitant falsetto of his to one of the tracks—the twee, contemplative “Dirty Hands,” where he actually fits well amongst the beatless chimes and strings—he largely leaves the vocals to R&B singers who can do his heavy-breaks production justice, like Icebird collaborator <name>Aaron Livingston</name> (“Love and Go”) or Little Brother's <name>Phonte Coleman</name>(doing a more straightfaced—and affecting—version of his <name>Percy Miracles</name> loverman schtick on “Temperamental”). It peaks on “See You Leave,” a cut featuring Roots-affiliated rapper STS and singer/writer <name>Khari Mateen</name>, that's as buttery as it gets; on an album that fits right in with R&B and hip-hop's free-for-all cross-genre fusion it's good to hear that RJ can build trad-soul beats with the best of them.Still, as easy as it is to click with these songs as dance tracks or muso-appreciation fodder (RJ can still program and orchestrate a breakdown like nobody's business), it's better still to zone out and catch their sense of mood. While the vocal tracks are well-realized, this is the first album RJ's made in a long time that actually feels like it's satisfied to say most of what it has to say in instrumental form. His style-weaving, retro-contemporary instrumentation dislodges sounds from their own times and finds new modes for them. So when he rolls out burbling synthesizers that recall the early '90s heyday of ambient techno and 70s prog and glazes them over a class-of-'88 no-bullshit boom-bap break (“A Lot of Night Ahead of You”), or constructs a noir-jazz ballad that snaps from early Tom Waits tipsiness to uptempo <name>Mayfield</name>-style funk (“Got There, Sugar?”), all the parts fit together to turn a pastiche into something a bit less beholden to the sum of its parts. It's less about where the pieces come from than what they're evoking. And even if it's made clear by the conceptual thread that ties the album together—a three-part suite that leads off the album, appears at the halfway mark, and concludes it with three emotively varying takes on the same melodic theme—the fact that the whole of More Is Than Isn't evokes so many different well-built moods is testament to how much he's been able to elaborate on what he's capable of."
4548	17657	"A few years ago, a micro-scene started brewing in the UK, centered on a loose collection of friendly, lo-fi-leaning rock bands. This cohort was best represented on the 2010 compilation PVI0006/IBB004, jointly released by artist-run labels Paradise Vendors and Italian Beach Babes. As that generic title implies, the scene was more about inter-band camaraderie than a specific sound-- more about sharing split releases and trading links than hiring publicists or branding themselves. So it's no shock that no movement ever came from it; in fact, a few of the bands don't even exist anymore. But others-- Male Bonding, Cold Pumas, Fair Ohs-- have gone on to make more substantial work on their own.At the head of that surviving class sits Mazes, thanks to the leap they've taken with their second album, Ores & Minerals. Its predecessor, 2011's A Thousand Heys, was a solid take on 90s American indie, but a bit too beholden to its influences. Ores & Minerals fixes that and adds a lot more. Singer/guitarist <name>Jack Cooper</name> claims he wanted to make a record ""that wasn't influenced by anything but influenced by everything,"" and his trio has achieved that seemingly paradoxical goal. You can still hear traces of other bands here, but Mazes' sound now is more an idiosyncratic hybrid than an enthusiastic photocopy.That's perhaps due to how the trio wrote their songs this time. Many began as loops rather than melodies, resulting in immediate hooks that gradually extend into something longer-lasting. The effect is clear from the very first track, ""Bodies"", which morphs from a simple indie pop tune into a hypnotic twin-guitar jam. It evokes similar journeys by Television and the Feelies, not in exact sound but in feel-- that is, in the way its seven minutes of blissful music would still be effective at twice the length.The template set by ""Bodies"" is furthered by the krautrocky title track and the mesmerizing ""Skulking"", which ramps into a crescendo of Velvet Underground-like fuzz. In between those expansive pieces lies a wealth of sonic variety. There's the slow sway of ""Dan Higgs Particle"", the proggy, Malkmus-esque lope of ""Sucker Punched"", and even an eerie piano piece called ""Leominster"". Mazes fuse those styles by sheer force of personality-- each tune bears their own thoughtful approach first and influences second.It also helps that <name>Cooper</name> keeps the words to a minimum. Many of his lyrics on A Thousand Heys comprised long sentences spooled out in a breathless, sometimes rambling rush. But here he sticks mostly to short phrases with lots of pauses in between. The tactic gives the album a haiku-ish feel, with <name>Cooper</name> exploring his subjects--- relationships, divorces, aging-- in terms that are openly universal rather than limitingly specific.There is one moment on Ores & Minerals that could be about something particular. Halfway through the title track, <name>Cooper</name> sings about ""looking in, looking out on a scene that's distorted/ Liking things, friend it, report it/ You're contorted."" Perhaps that's his take on what happened with the scene Mazes came from (something he expands upon in this interview), suggesting any attempt to summarize only distorted what it was really about. But it feels more like <name>Cooper</name>'s moved on, and on Ores & Minerals he's more interested in contorting his own sound than worrying about anyone else's."
8668	13392	"Over the past few years, the small Norwegian label Miasmah Records has been heroically doing its part to make the world a slightly darker, lonelier place with a steady stream of majestically bleak ambient classical releases, some inspired by the frozen polar climes.  Last year's Treny, by the Polish producer <name>Michal Jacaszek</name>, was a funereal wash of chamber strings and electronics, but it scans as harmlessly pretty next to Kreng's seriously nasty L'Autopsie Phénoménale De Dieu. The debut by the Belgian artist <name>Pepijn Caudron</name>, L'Autopsie is a harrowing bad trip of a record, a malevolent wisp of low drones, eerie, high whines, and disquieting found-sound samples. If that doesn't sound like quite the right soundtrack for your soul-wiltingly hot late August-- well, maybe keep it in mind for late February, when the ground is the same pallid color as the sky.  You'll need this sort of thing then.""Na De Sex"" opens the proceedings on a deceptively peaceful note, a piano tumbling its way down the only major scale you will hear for the rest of the album. Then, an ominous tritone-- bowed on one violin and plucked on another-- intrudes, and from that point forward, the lights shut off completely. Except for a mournful little gypsy violin figure that pops up briefly on ""Caliban,"" L'Autopsie dispenses completely with Treny's weeping string arrangements. The sonic landscape here is arid, even desolate: a single violin whispers a high harmonic; a muted trumpet bleats feebly; a brushed snare rasps like sandpaper. The instruments are separated by yawning caverns of blank space, and the effect is not dissimilar to a Webern miniature, where the silences grow so immense that you begin to be aware of your own heartbeat.To raise hackles higher, <name>Caudron</name> scatters a mix of deeply disturbing sound samples throughout, ranging from muffled screams and dialogue sampled from old horror movies (""Why don't you turn back into a cat?"" a man inquires at one point. ""I liked you better that way"") to rodent-like squeaking noises, to-- most upsetting of all-- the sound of a young woman sobbing quietly while <name>Chopin</name>'s mournful Prelude No. 20 in C minor plays in the foreground. On ""Slaapliedje"", children whisper horrible, ghostly sounds into your ear.  Wobbly old recordings of opera sopranos spin in a back room somewhere, furthering the creep factor.With such a haunted-house ambience, it takes awhile before you notice that <name>Caudron</name> actually uses a wide range of instrumentation on L'Autopsie, including cello, bassoon, and accordion.  He seems to operate on the principle, however, that if the instrument can't be shrunk down teeny-tiny and made to emulate a creaking door, then it goes out the window. There are some glowing piano passages that recall Satie, and some vaguely tribal bangs and clonks in the percussion that summon the spirit of <name>Harry Partch</name>, but mostly, L'Autopsie belongs to its own genre,  ready-made to soundtrack upcoming <name>David Lynch</name> films or avant-garde theater productions (not coincidentally, the surrealist theater troupe Abbatoir Fermé has used <name>Kreng</name>'s music for some of its productions). Hovering like a unshakeable doubt or a 3 a.m. bout of existential dread, L'Autopsie is brilliantly sinister mood music; put it on in the background and it will surely make whatever task you are engaged in at least 30% more evil."
3640	18658	"Regional funk and R&B compilations have been flooding the reissue market for ages now, and yet in all that time, it's taken until this year for even the deepest-digging reissue label in the business to get to the foundation of one of the most vital scenes in funk lore. The chart-topping, synth-heavy pulse that came out of the Twin Cities in the 80s still seems, even to most music fans short of the local veteran scenester, to be an abrupt fluke of auteurist proficiency and creativity, largely credited to the braintrusts of everything-man superstar Prince and the songwriting/production juggernaut of Jimmy Jam Harris and Terry Lewis. The groups these three names cut their chops with have been hinted at by music historians, and the peers they shared a scene with got some acknowledgment here and there. But little of this information has ever really been put into the wider context of what Minneapolis sounded like before the Minneapolis Sound. How could the scene that gave us 1999 and Control have such an underknown history where its pre-eighties R&B roots are concerned?Thanks to the deep knowledge base and research that went into Numero Group's Purple Snow compilation, it's made clear just why that is—and why, in a fairer world, it shouldn't have been the case. A large metro area split between the rival identies of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the Twin Cities had plenty of pitfalls for touring bands. It's a long drive to just about everywhere—more than 300 miles to Milwaukee, 400 to Chicago, and 700 to Cincinnati. Staying home, meanwhile, meant a relatively small support group to break bands on a wider scale before they had the buzz to go national. Booking for funk and R&B bands was constrained to a small circuit of clubs, including venues like the Nacirema and the Cozy Bar, that had vanished by the time First Avenue served as the setting for Purple Rain. There weren't any nationally-distributed, Minneapolis-based indie labels that supported the sound on the level of the garage-pop powerhouse of Soma in the 60s or the punk/new wave stronghold of Twin/Tone in the 80s. What few radio stations supported the format were low-wattage and under-the-radar, while the local press was more fixated on finding the next breakthrough folkie to emerge from the campus coffeehouse circuit like Bob Dylan a decade before.By now, that one Chris Rock joke might be coming to mind—that the only two black people in Minnesota are Prince and (the now late) Kirby Puckett. Which is hyperbole, of course, but not by much. Despite the presence of strong black communities in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul dating back generations, there was still enough of a widespread passive-aggressive animosity from forces outside the community that manifested as a cold shoulder to deeper integration. In 1978, the same year Prince released his debut album For You, Twins owner Calvin Griffith was caught stating that the reason he picked Minnesota as the destination city for the Washington Senators' 1961 relocation was because “we found out you only had 15,000 blacks here.” The music scene wasn't much easier—more than one musician in the liner notes to Purple Snow mentions that groups couldn't get booked unless there were at least a few white faces in the band. Between prejudice, lack of resources, and a geographically isolated and constrained locale, there was only one way a funk scene could thrive in the Twin Cities: people had to stick together and network, even as limited resources meant stiff competition.For the better part of the 70s, that meant a lot of woodshedding, experimentation, personnel crossover, community outreach, and evolution—but not a signature style. Most of the material on Purple Snow that dates from the early-mid 70s pre-synthesized, pre-disco funk era could come from just about anywhere, so long as that anywhere had a bunch of talented kids who dug Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes. Many of them typically followed those artists' opulent musicianship, albeit with tighter budgets and dimmer spotlights. Haze, a St. Paul band who predated Prince by having some Purple in their identity until they figured the Hendrix estate wouldn't approve, recorded an excellent debut album in 1974. Two cuts from that self-titled LP—the minor-hit ballad “I Do Love My Lady” and the uptempo conga funk of “Waiting for the Moment”—emphasize the close harmonies, purring organ, and swirling, liquid wah-wah guitars that play up their psychedelic-soul bonafides. Prophets of Peace, who did everything they could to land gigs but saw their ambitions thwarted by the Cities' constraints, were a big horn-driven unit in the tradition of War or Mandrill; what the selection “Get On” lacks in deep messaging (“hey everybody, we wanna party/ all night long”) it makes up for in the kind of crowdpleasing tightness and groove that heated every undersized dancefloor it was pointed at.And then there's the Family—not to be confused with the mid-80s Prince offshoot of the same name that recorded “Nothing Compares 2 U” five years before Sinead did. A tight-knit crew of musicians who changed their name from Black Magic after some interloping Chicagoans (and, more damagingly, the media) mistook their community center homebase for a turf-war locale, the Family—here billed as Music, Love & Funk—contribute a sweaty yet sophisticated Ohio Players-caliber seven-plus-minute jam called “Stone Lover”, recorded in 1976. By then, Spike Moss and the neighborhood resource that was The Way community center had become a nexus for North Minneapolis youth to hone their playing, and the opportunity to record at the legendary Sound 80 studios of Blood on the Tracks fame drew in a grip of local musicians to join the chorus.One of the voices to jump in on that cut was one Prince Nelson, then a teenager on the verge of dropping his last name as he got his session-rat studies in at Chris Moon's busy Moonsound Studios. And if there's one thing that Purple Snow makes clear, it's that Prince was practically everywhere in the scene during the late 70s, a prodigial player who learned from everybody and subsequently lent his credits to groups like the Lewis Connection (background vocals and guitar on the silky slow jam “Got to Be Something Here”) and 94 East (the pool-party smoothness of “If You See Me"", where his taut chicken-scratch lead guitar riff barely reveals the virtuoso lurking beneath the hired-hand pro). It's a bit odd to hear him primarily in the context of just another piece of a bigger puzzle, even if his burgeoning talent is attested to frequently in the album's liner notes. (A Minnesota Daily quote, inspired by observations of him at work at Moonsound: “He's got his program pretty well worked out and the wheels are in motion... it's only a matter of time.”) But it goes a long way towards explaining just how and why he managed to dominate the Minneapolis scene: not merely with outrageous style, crossover aspirations, or courting controversy, but by working his ass off.The only artists to rival Prince's proficiency at the time were, of course, Jimmy Harris and Terry Lewis. As inseparable as their identities have become, Purple Snow makes a point of outlining how divergent their parallel paths really were before they joined forces at the turn of the 80s. Harris put drumming first—he did gigs with his father, “Cornbread” Harris, in a jazz trio before he hit his teens. Then he auditioned for a band at age 13 and found himself outclassed behind the kit, so he joined as a keyboard player instead and cut his teeth on an electric piano borrowed from his dad. By high school, Harris' ear for Philly soul and knack for songwriting led him to become the keyboardist, writer and arranger for a group called Mind & Matter. That band's material here is commercial-friendly to a point—Lewis's Gamble/Huff nods are savvy, and catchy as all get-out—but with the circa-1977 equipment at his fingertips, Lewis' budget-minded substitution of synthesizers for string sections is a bit prescient. Sadly, not prescient enough to find an audience—though they more than held their own in warmup gigs for disco-soul bands like Pleasure and Brass Construction.Terry Lewis was clued in to Harris's talent, but wasn't able to recruit him into the own thing he had going for a while: a Funkadelic-inspired band intially known as Wars of Armageddon before they changed their name to the less-apocalyptic, Donald Byrd-inspired Flyte Tyme. (The photo of this band in full Mothership-stowaway regalia is worth the price of the collection alone.) Flyte Tyme were more defiantly funky than some of the smooth-soul bands they shared the city with, and powerhouse enough to reportedly upstage Prince when he played his first hometown headlining gig at Minneapolis' Capri Theater in February 1979. In the songs included here from a 1979 Flyte Tyme session—“It's the Things That You Do” and “I've Got You on My Mind”—there's a polished yet gutsy momentum that pairs slap bass and synthesizers to evocative (and scene-definingly familiar) effect. Fatefully, one of the band's most crucial components at the time was singer Cynthia Johnson, who boasted the kind of outer-space glamour and Chaka Khan chops that could've made Flyte Tyme huge. But in jumping ship from Flyte Tyme to record the vocals for Lipps. Inc's “Funkytown”—one of the first hits for the Minneapolis Sound and one of the last of the disco era—another identity change for the band was necessary. As fate would have it, Harris's gig with Mind & Matter wasn't panning out, and the side work he was getting in the studio— including playing all the synthesized instruments and drums on Michael A. Dixon & J.O.Y.'s 1980 electro-gospel curiosity “You're All I Need”—wasn't enough. So the man his DJ gig christened Jimmy Jam became Flyte Tyme's second keyboardist. The Flyte was eventually grounded, leaving them as the Time.With those enduring luminaries at work, it's still worth acknowledging some of the groups that either fell through the cracks or found minor stardom on a modest scale. While the Minneapolis sound comes across on the surface like an e pluribus unum nucleus where everyone eventually benefited from the stratospheric rise of a few, the expectations and associations of being in with Prince and company could wear an artist down. Some defied it, like the velvety quiet storm stylings of Rockie Robbins (“Together”) or the straightforward disco-flavored groove of Band of Thieves veteran guitarist Orville Shannon (“One Life to Live”). Others were drawn into the inner circle, only to be steered towards something they didn't quite fit, like Sue Ann Carwell, a self-proclaimed “little ghetto chick just hanging around town” whose tenuous Prince connections led to a Warner Bros. contract. Her self-titled 1981 debut, produced by Pete Bellotte in a half-assed compromise between Minneapolis and Italo-disco, bricked big-time, while a truer-to-the-style 1982 track, “Should I Or Should I Not"", was shopped around A&Rs to no avail. And while the early works of the more familiar names here are intriguing, there's the feeling that they should've led to more than just famous affiliations. Alexander O'Neal, the charismatic, rangy-voiced post-Johnson frontman for Flyte Tyme until Morris Day replaced him, would notch a string of hits that early indie cuts like the squiggly get-down jams “Borrowed Time” and “Do You Dare” promisingly anticipated while proving that his success as a performer wasn't entirely dependent on Jam/Lewis. And Andre Cymone's minimalist, funky synthpop/new wave concoction “Somebody Said” makes it worth noting that his career encompassed far more than being one of Prince's longest cohorts and playing bass for the Revolution, even if that's how his mid-80s solo albums were pigeonholed.Then again, few shadows were harder to escape than the one of Minnesota itself. Longtime residents and scenesters might flip through the booklet of Purple Snow and note the way these artists positioned themselves among local landmarks—Prophets of Peace lined up among the lavish foliage of the Como Park Conservatory; 94 East lounging in the shadows of Charles Ginnever's jagged modernist sculpture 'Nautilus' outside the Walker Art Center; Mind & Matter raising disco fingers to the sky perched atop the mushroom-like brutalist platforms of Peavey Plaza. The musicians position themselves like they're unusual presences in these Twin Cities landmarks, even though they're established local artists. Maybe they felt out of place, crowded out, even unwelcome. And whether the emergence of the Minneapolis Sound in the 80s changed all that is still somewhat uncertain; alt-country and bluegrass acts currently overwhelm up-and-coming R&B and hip-hop artists in sheer number and opportunity. But the precedent that Purple Snow traces led to something special: a situation where a core of artists were given an inch and wound up taking a mile—not out of greed, but of necessity."
15907	7144	"""This Jello tastes how you look.""
    Unfortunately, the next conscious thought I had after my slurred uttering of that phrase revolved around how my cousin's living room ceiling had
    too many tiles for me to count without getting sick in an adjacent fireplace.  Mouth dry and stomach unsettled, my first drunken experience--
    at the tender age of 14-- had left me queasy, weak, and saddled with an inability to drink anything with the word ""orange"" in it for the next five years.  Happily,
    aside from gaining valuable self-knowledge regarding the recuperative abilities of the teenage liver, the experience succeeded in teaching me the fear and
    respect due to one of mankind's most blinding furies-- the homemade concoction that is ""white lightning.""
    Backwoods and brutish, moonshine is intended neither for the faint-of-heart nor those unwilling to engage in a modicum of experimentation, as it requires a
    certain amount of what my papa would call ""gumption"" in order to acclimate oneself to both the taste and effect of this pernicious beverage.  Years later I would
    approach Sightings' album Absolutes with a similar sense of cautionary adventure, preparing myself for a beautiful assault that I would inevitably and repeatedly
    lose myself in, regardless of the consequences.
    Anchored in the Cartesian-related premise that pain is the only thought process that will not betray one's reality, Absolutes begins with the organic-by-way-of-savageness
    static feedback of ""White Keys"".  Creating an awkward and psychotic ""twist,"" the instrumentation of guitarist Mark Morgan and bassist Richard Hoffman slowly becomes
    blurred as the song progresses, the only constant amid the cacophony being Morgan's buried yelps of ""woo-hoo"" and ""ah-ah"" that eventually collide in a gigantic screech
    signaling the conclusion of the disc's preface.  ""Infinity of Stops"" picks up directly thereafter, as the static pulse is refurbished with a clipping beat courtesy
    of drummer John Lockie and some squealing guitar manipulations that are similarly hacked to bits by the underlying bass line.  This too inescapably falls victim to the
    approaching fallout of the bare percussion, a reluctant follower of the chaos that recently cleared the path for its creation and release.
    Given the pummeling offensive the band tends to rely on, it's unexpected that Sightings outfit multiple tracks with what sounds like the sophisticated gamelan-influenced
    playing style of the Indonesian Isles.  Perhaps as a move to admonish comments regarding the band as a second rate Boredoms or Pussy Galore-- or perhaps as
    sheer coincidence-- ""Bishops"" begins with a tangible and lasting beat, in itself a shock coming from the No New York-influenced band, that eventually waylays an example
    of such an Eastern-tinged rhythm into the high end of the mix.  As Morgan continues to do his best John Lydon impression, uttering nonsensical phrases and monosyllabic
    sounds, the Javanese-esque melody eventually fades to echo only to reappear transformed in the following track, ""Canadian Money"".  Syncopating from within the belly
    of a steel factory, the metal drums rule the track as a rapid-fire attack of humming and pounding fight and win the battle to keep above the current of rising guitar fallouts
    and steady bass-drones.
    Further rallying against cries of homogeneity in a field of Rock 'N Roll where such accusations are rampant and unpleasantly expected, Sightings does not rest in
    presenting a bevy of tracks that display their knack for subtle interplay.  Possibly an inverted political message,
    ""Right Side of the Hall"" is a D.C.-hardcore tune at heart, with vocals channeled as an animal growl and a pop-rhythm section so simple and catchy, it would be a crime to
    bury it beneath all of that feedback-- if in the end it wasn't such a beautiful statement of artistic freedom to do so.  ""E.E."" is further evidence of the group's pop mastery, as
    the track exemplifies in forty-five seconds what Man...or Astroman? have been attempting to accomplish for the past four years-- an Elvis Presley beach-song
    characteristically played by the heavy machinery of a high-rise construction crew.
    The track exists in stark contrast to the veritable jam sessions of ""Anna Mae Wong"" and ""Reduction"", both of which surpass the seven-minute mark during the unraveling of
    their respective sound.  In the former, the group uses the moments between starts and stops to develop a suspenseful tension that eventually becomes a pattern of
    instrumental call-and-response bringing to mind comparisons with the early improvisation of jazz and the blues.  The latter track further builds upon this, but instead of a
    silent backdrop for the voices to argue against ""Reduction"" provides a sobering cadence, a beat that sputters out modestly in a manner befitting a composition that is showy
    only in its lack of pretense.
    A difficult album to take in, one should not disregard Absolutes based on a single listen, or even three or four.  Like the outline diagrammed on the cover for the production
    of sweet-corn hooch, the rewards of the disc increase exponentially with repeated listens and time.  Not the sound of something new, but merely the sound of something
    done right, Sightings has hit upon an extraordinary groove, one they will hopefully ride out to its pure and uncomplicated end."
7244	14821	"In his 2004 memoir, Chronicles, Volume One, Bob Dylan writes of encountering Mike Seeger in the early 1960s in Greenwich Village, and being left spellbound by the effortless mastery the folk legend exhibited in his interpretations of a dizzying array of traditional American song forms. ""He played these songs as good as it was possible to play them,"" Dylan writes, adding that, ""What I had to work at, Mike already had in his genes, in his genetic makeup... The thought occurred to me that maybe I'd have to write my own folk songs.""The 47 songs collected on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 allow us to witness how Dylan went about doing just that. Representing the fruits of his first two publishing contracts (with Leeds Music and with M. Witmark & Sons), the set reveals a much subtler and more fascinating journey than the popular shorthand myth of Dylan's shifting cleanly from folk apprentice to political firebrand to poetic rock'n'roller. For starters, a great many of the songs to which Dylan first affixed his name as writer were simply his own original lyrics atop traditional folk melodies. Not all of these words excoriated social injustice either-- far from it. Even from the beginning, there were love songs and outlaw songs, moodily poetic songs and broad jokes. Still, The Witmark Demos does demonstrate an evolution in songwriting genius, and one that took place in a frighteningly short period of a time by a young man who'd yet to turn 24 when the last of these recordings were made. On this set, you can hear Dylan moving past the bedrock melodies of folk and crafting indelible ones of his own (""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right""). You can hear him perfecting the protest song (""Blowin' in the Wind"", ""Masters of War""). And you can hear him falling in love with the music of words and beginning to invent a new vocabulary for pop music (a scratchy, nascent piano-only take of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"").Only 15 of the set's 47 songs are unheard in any incarnation on a previous Dylan release (more on them later). The other 32 are split fairly evenly between germinal takes on songs from early-60s Dylan albums and alternate rough cuts of tunes that appear in equally embryonic states on the first Bootleg Series issue, 1991's Volumes 1-3. You might think auxiliary efforts would be of interest only to Dylan obsessives-- and in some cases these readings scarcely differ from others in his catalogue. Still, there are revelations: The oft-covered ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" has appeared previously only in live form on Dylan's second greatest hits compilation, and the version here is far richer, the guitar playing lovely and sublime. The classic protest song ""Oxford Town"" may be less immaculate here, but it's more bracing and insistent. The readings of ""Mama, You've Been on My Mind"" and ""I'll Keep It with Mine"" are especially pained and plaintive, while the bitingly satirical ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" and ""Rambling, Gambling Willie"" are looser and more ebullient here than anywhere else they've appeared before.As for the 15 ""new"" songs, a few are mere fragments and a few others are fairly boilerplate, but again there are real treasures. ""Farewell"" haunts with its melody while ""The Death of Emmett Till"" haunts with its words, yet both are outshone by the bitterly ironic tour de force ""Long Ago, Far Away"", where Dylan enumerates social injustices ostensibly relegated to the distant past that were in fact still occuring in his own time, witheringly spitting the refrain, ""Those things don't happen no more nowadays."" ""I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day"" and ""All Over You"" further display comic sides, and then there's ""Long Time Gone"", which shows us an initial flowering of the unflappably cool mythical icon Dylan would fully become in the mid-60s. The song's refrain offers a perfect summation of how this set reveals the historical depth of Dylan's musical education as well as the lengths to which he would eclipse it. ""I'm a long time a-comin',"" Dylan sings, ""and I'll be a long time gone."""
201	22547	Joe Budden has defined himself as an intensely emotional tough guy who has never stopped putting everything out there, but the New Jersey rapper’s best music has frequently cut inward. Throughout his Mood Muzik mixtape-series-turned-brand, Budden has picked at and peeled away his depression, addiction, and the many embarrassments he’s collected as an eager public figure. When he’s down, he opens up. In many ways Budden is an under-acknowledged trailblazer of hip-hop’s 21st century relationship with the Internet, ahead of his time in living for and through the web as much as alongside it. He nurtured his online fans before it was an obvious play, earning and grooming a cult following of lyric-obsessed hip-hop heads, some of whom prize his legitimate emo leanings, and some who just love bars.On his new album, Rage & the Machine, Budden’s music is less moody but as densely lyrical as ever. His raps have long leaned on the preferred devices of the competitive lyricism he exemplifies: puns, metaphors, clever topicality. “I used to drive around the tunnel in a Lexus with a snub/Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club,” he raps on “Uncle Joe,” a track that plays on his preferred trope of bitter contempt for the current state of hip-hop.The record is produced almost entirely by the Providence beatmaker AraabMUZIK, a 27-year-old whose pyrotechnic pad-smashing earned him viral YouTube fame as an MPC whiz. AraabMUZIK, whose given name is Abraham Orellana, has been generously collaborative and experimental, producing for the Diplomats and many others in a meandering career. Unfortunately, Rage & the Machine skips over Orellana’s most interesting inclinations—forward-looking fusions of electronic, dance, and street hip-hop—in favor of his most traditional ones, an unfortunate fit for Budden’s reductionist New York rap nostalgia.AraabMUZIK isn’t the type to dwell on a beat, and has established a formula of programming drums that is both finicky and mechanical. On a song like “Flex,” a conspicuous lead single that features Fabolous and Tory Lanez, he piles drum sounds onto each other expertly before haphazardly triggering a sample atop. With a breathless, high-word-count approach to lyricism, Budden benefits from the boxed-in nature of AraabMUZIK percussion, which give him a wall to push against. “Forget” is one of the best bits of matchmaking, a short, verse-only ramble on a boom bap 2.0 beat that lets both artists play to their talents. “I Gotta Ask” is a committed Jay Z homage; instead of an Annie number, !llmind flips a Sondheim stage song into similarly whimsical territory. Budden adopts Jay’s cadence to run down his preferred list of boasts and persistent complaints. Elsewhere, some songs arrive a little late to the party in borrowed clothes. “I Wanna Know” samples a Manhattans loop which was also the thrust of a standout Madlib beat on Freddie Gibbs’ 2014 breakout album Pinata. Sample recycling might not be the faux pas it once was in hip-hop—Madlib himself wasn’t the first to pull this record—but AraabMUZIK’s simple chop and pitch-up make it feel like a blatant beatjack. On a separate song, a separate infraction: “Time for Work” has a hook sung by Emanny that he must have written while listening to Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em,” because the melody is all but the same. More generally, Budden has struggled with making catchy songs and this album carries a couple clunkers with gawky hooks. To the rapper’s credit, Rage & the Machine is one of his more accessible records, less emotionally insular than usual, but perhaps a little cold for that reason. It’s not a redesign as much as a measured refinement. There’s a fan service aspect to Budden’s music by now that hinges on his fixed audience. “What you expecting from me?/Why else you checking for me?,” the singer Jazzy wonders on a track called “By Law.” If you’re listening to a Joe Budden album in 2016, you probably already know what you’re in for.
14188	7604	"Could this be the end of our intrepid heroes?
    More than a decade after these blissfully genre-bending Welsh popsters
    burst through a rip in the space-time continuum with all the
    self-assured ambition of five guys in a (soon literal) armored tank,
    Super Furry Animals are presenting symptoms of a band about to
    re-enter the ether: a suddenly human album, 2003's Phantom
    Power; a solo project, singer Gruff Rhys's just-released Yr
    Atal Genhedlaeth; and now a career-spanning singles compilation.
    Marrying a Japanese avant-garde artist can't be far off.
    For those of you just joining us: Super Furry Animals were the most
    life-affirming British pop group of the late 1990s, retaining their
    yen for sunny melodies even as Radiohead perfected gloomy computer-age
    ennui and Blur's buoyant choruses sank into heartbreakingly dissonant
    sad bastard music. Since landing on this watery, sun-scorched planet,
    SFA have gleefully mish-mashed influences that include the Beach Boys, the
    Beatles, David Bowie, and Chemical Brothers. With 2001's Rings
    Around the World came 70s soul and widespread acclaim. Even
    Phantom Power added a touch of Byrdsian country-rock.
Songbook spans all those sounds and more, cramming 21
    perception-twisting singles on one disc. Yes, that means the band's
    plentiful instrumentals are absent, as are some of keyboardist Cian
    Ciárán's electronic contributions. But while Songbook contains
    a few sops to obscurity-seekers (the non-album gem ""Ice Hockey Hair""
    and ""Blerwytirhwng"", from the band's pre-Creation debut EP), the disc
    aims more toward awing neophytes with the group's unbridled pop
    prowess than sating completists. The management is not responsible for
    hats, purses, or hipster poses lost during the ride.
    My sources assure me that Wales is a real place, but I prefer to think
    of it as an imaginary kingdom, like Oz or Narnia or a sovereign Iraq.
    Its national anthem would be this album's irrepressible opener, 1996's
    ""Something 4 the Weekend"", which somersaults down puffy cloudscapes
    like ""Mr. Blue Sky"" for the eclectic decade. ""The Man Don't Give a
    Fuck"" is Supergrass's ""Pumpin' on Your Stereo"" armed with 52 f-bombs,
    a Steely Dan sample,and leftist politics; the proggy quasi-Britpop of
    ""Do or Die"" very nearly cops its guitar line from the Allman Brothers'
    ""Jessica"". Quoting ""Juxtapozed With U"" might not get the girl from
    Poli Sci class out of that halter top, but its goofy vocoder come-ons
    will give you something to smile about as you stumble home wearing her
    Long Island iced tea.
    As with 1998 b-sides and rarities compilation Outspaced,
    Songbook is built like an album, not a retrospective. In other
    words, forget anything resembling chronological order. Thus the
    voluptuous bombast of 2002's ""It's Not the End of the World"" (which,
    to confuse matters further, wouldn't sound out of place on Blur's
    The Great Escape) fades into the ""Deadweight""-era Beck
    tropicalia of ""Northern Lites"", from 1999's Guerilla.
    Fortunately, the art-punky ""Hermann Loves Pauline"" and flange-laden
    ""Play It Cool""-- two of the most weirdly inventive songs from 1997's
    Radiator-- show up consecutively, albeit in reverse order from
    their original appearance. Wales has ways of making you think.
    Yeah, Super Furry Animals sure were a great band. Maybe you can catch
    them in 10 years when they go on their reunion cash-in tour and get
    the hype they deserve. Wait, what's that? You say the title is
    portentously denoted Volume One? That the Super Furries have
    already recorded much of their next album, due for release later this
    year? Shit, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. TO
    BE CONTINUED..."
4215	18165	"The current Black Sabbath reunion has been star-crossed almost from the start. Original members Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward staged a splashy press conference in November 2011 to announce a tour and a Rick Rubin-produced album, but the mood quickly soured. Subsequent months brought a lymphoma diagnosis for guitarist and sole consistent member Iommi, a contract dispute involving drummer Ward, high-profile gigs with a fill-in behind the kit, and, finally, the eyebrow-raising news that the comeback LP-- the first full studio record to involve more than two members of Sabbath 1.0 since 1983's Ozzy-less Born Again-- would feature Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk. The peanut gallery snarked; fans despaired.That 13 isn't an out-of-touch embarrassment is a surprise. That it's cohesive, engaging, and even fun is a near-shock. As with most Rubin ventures, the goal from the outset was to help the band recapture their original mojo, the chemistry that made their initial 1970-78 run so brilliant. Does 13 measure up to classics such as Paranoid and Vol. 4? Of course not. No amount of good intention could recapture the black magic of the band's narcotically enhanced glory days, and while Wilk's performance is sturdy enough, no sub could eclipse Ward, one of the most distinctive rock drummers of the last 40 years and the engine behind Sabbath's signature sludge-blues cadences. But 13 does offer many of the primal joys that helped immortalize Sabbath in the first place, while documenting the spark that still unites Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler, all three of whom sound about as vital here as anyone could've hoped.The record's greatest strength is how well it captures the apocalyptic trudge that Sabbath nailed from the very first downbeat of their 1970 debut. The doomy passages in the first two tracks, ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", sound stupendously heavy. This isn't just a result of 13's raw production values; it's also that the band is clearly grasping for the same dire emotions (soul-deep malaise, reaper-fearing horror) that fueled their early work, emotions that from the mid-'80s on-- as Iommi carried on under the Sabbath banner with a Wiki-nightmare's worth of collaborators-- have shared album space with less weighty, more pedestrian hard rock. As Iommi, Butler, and Wilk lurch through the titanic riff of ""End of the Beginning"", with Ozzy sneering, ""Reeeeeee-animation of the sequence,"" it's clear that a legacy is being reclaimed. Osbourne, for one, may have squandered any remaining mystique when he opted for reality-TV stardom, but he proves here that he still wields an eerie power at the mic.The album doesn't fixate on crawling gloom. Early Sabbath is often portrayed as monolithic, but the band's 1970-78 discography was as eclectic in its way as the canons of the Beatles or Zeppelin. On 13, the band salutes fans with obvious allusions to some of their early outside-the-box classics: sassy midtempo groover ""Loner"" and the faintly cheesy yet improbably moving ballad ""Zeitgeist"" recall ""N.I.B."" and ""Planet Caravan"", respectively. And the sliding-panel, multi-movement structures of ""Age of Reason"" and ""End of the Beginning"" serve as a reminder that the original Sabbath explored their own outlandish brand of progressive rock on later LPs such as 1975's Sabotage. Aside from ""God Is Dead?"", with its plodding, laborious verses, the album's many long tracks feel brisk and hooky.As sturdy as 13's songs are, the album's signature feature might be its pervasive jamminess. Sabbath were never much for the drawn-out grandstanding of Zeppelin, but they did begin life as a blues band on the nightly grind. The group flaunts those roots constantly on 13, in the process spotlighting the partnership that's always been Sabbath's heart and soul: the Iommi/Butler tandem. During triumphant instrumental breakdowns in ""End of the Beginning"" and ""God Is Dead?"", the guitarist and bassist braid together like a heavy-metal Garcia and Lesh, forming a single mercurial mass. Iommi indulges in his share of well-deserved guitar-heroism throughout the record-- most notably on the exuberantly bluesy ""Damaged Soul""-- but with Butler shadowing him, these so-called solos feel more like hive-mind communions. It doesn't hurt that the bass tone on 13 is extraordinary-- one of the fattest and most gut-churning that Butler has achieved on record.Offsetting that blood-brother harmony is the odd man out behind the kit. The stiff unaccompanied drum intro to ""Age of Reason"" is just one of many reminders here that Wilk comes from an entirely different school, not to mention generation, than his collaborators. While Rage Against the Machine owed Iommi a significant debt in the riff department, that band's rhythmic orientation had far more to do with crisp funk than blues-based hard rock. (To find a truly sympathetic sub for 13, Rubin and the band might have looked to the contemporary doom-metal demimonde, home of drummers like Eyehategod's Joey LaCaze, who specialize in the grimy ooze that powered early Sabbath.) Often, as on the triplet-feel verse section of ""Live Forever"", Wilk sounds like he's trying hard not to mess up. And he doesn't, exactly, but something is lost in the effort. Bill Ward's genius was that he never seemed to care about meeting an objective standard of precision. The early Sabbath drum tracks are riddled with what could technically be described as flubs; they also feature some of the most exhilaratingly earthy percussion rock'n'roll has ever seen.To be fair, Wilk's appearance was always framed as a sideman gig. (The press materials for 13 diplomatically state that the band were ""joined at the sessions"" by the drummer.) And there are moments, such as on the sinister strut that opens ""Dear Father"", where Wilk achieves a real chemistry with his elders. Details aside, though, Ward's absence from 13 shouldn't be glossed over. His shaggy, intuitive swing may have been less commanding than the brontosaurus whomp of John Bonham, but it was no less integral to his band's signature sound. Sabbath has at times weathered their countless personnel shifts gracefully; for example, the lineup featuring late vocal great Ronnie James Dio, eventually billed under the name Heaven & Hell, attained its own special brand of dark majesty. Yet the fact that a full-on original-members reunion was promised and then retracted lends 13 a whiff of the consolation prize. In the end, 13 isn't what every Sabbath die-hard dreamed it might be: a true pick-up-where-they-left-off comeback for the group's founding quartet. But the record does belong in the view of every metalhead-- not just because such a seminal band still deserves obligatory props, but because, imperfections aside, the record embodies the kernel of the original Sabbath idea. That chilling crawl, that low-slung death-blues groove that seemed to come out of nowhere back in 1970, persists here in all its ominous potency, sounding out like an admonition of a genre that's grown increasingly overcalculated and gridlike during the ensuing 40 years, trading tortured humanity for robotic precision. Though fans may resent Black Sabbath for not resolving their personal differences more gracefully, one can't deny the pull of that existential outcry as channeled into what we now know as heavy metal. Their frames might be rusted, but these iron men still walk."
17262	3847	"If you were in your late teens and lived near Chicago between 1996 and 1999,
    chances are, you were a Braid fan.  Too young to have caught Smashing Pumpkins
    before they mutated into arena-rock dinosaurs, and too rambunctious to chin-stroke
    along with McEntire and O'Rourke, the angst-filled masses turned to Braid.  You
    could count on the Champaign foursome to play through the area once every month
    or two, filling up the Metro or the Fireside Bowl with bobbing heads and squinty
    rock-out faces.  Melodramatic lyrics, Fugazi-esque start/stops, time signature
    chaos, and an excellent balance of hardcore mentality and catchy melodicism--
    what more could a Midwestern eighteen year-old ask for?

    I know because I was there, pumping my fist to ""First Day Back"" with the rest of
    you.  And that's why I can't decide whether I'm disappointed or just plain angry
    about the vanilla ice-cream blandness of Everynight Fire Works.  See, Hey
    Mercedes is 75% of what once was Braid-- their answer to ""Saved by the Bell: The
    College Years,"" if you will.  When Braid broke up in early 2000, I took comfort
    in the fact that three-quarters of the band would continue on under a new moniker,
    without the services of guitarist/screamy-guy Chris Broach.  Their first,
    self-titled EP was an unimpressive effort, but live shows featured a number of
    unrecorded songs with potential.

    Then Hey Mercedes broke from Polyvinyl Records, the home of such respectable
    Midwesterners as AM/FM and Aloha, for Vagrant Records, the home of critically
    acclaimed artists like... hmmm... help me out here... Snapcase?  Well, anyway,
    given Vagrant's habit of churning out slick pop-punk product for chain-wallet
    accessorisors that just came down off a bad Blink-182 bender, the warning flags
    were raised.

    And indeed, these warning flags proved accurate upon the release of Everynight
    Fire Works.  Under the increasingly commercial-minded guidance of J. Robbins,
    every rough edge is polished up to a shimmering, radio-friendly gleam.  Close your
    eyes, and you can imagine most of these songs on MTV, maybe with the band in funny
    wigs and playing to a house full of underwear-clad teenagers.

    Still, Robbins helmed the boards on Braid's final and finest full-length, Frame
    and Canvas, so the blame cannot rest solely with him.  Frontman Bob Nanna
    seems determined to dumb down his songs to reach a wider audience, trading in the
    polyrhythms and unusual dynamics of old for power chords, power chords, power
    chords.  Sure, there's a few stutter-steps in tracks like ""A-List Actress"" and
    ""The Frowning of a Lifetime,"" but more common are songs like ""Our Weekend Starts
    on Wednesday"" and ""What You're Up Against,"" which roll along with little variation
    in tempo or volume.

    The one-dimensional nature of the album leads me to say words I never thought I'd
    utter: I miss Chris Broach.  While his contributions to Braid albums often seemed
    limited to emphatically yelling ""yeah!"" every once in a while, Hey Mercedes is
    sorely lacking the hard vocal counterpoint Broach would play to Nanna's sensitive
    guy act.  Also absent is the intricate instrumental interplay between Broach and
    Nanna, as guitarist Mark Dawursk adds little to indicate that Hey Mercedes even
    needs two six-strings.

    Frustratingly, a couple songs still manage to strike direct hits on my old
    Braid-lovin' soul.  ""Every Turn"" features the kind of acrobatically catchy vocal
    Nanna used to specialize in writing, with a great, crunchy chorus tailor-made for
    the at-home rockout.  Album closer ""Let's Go Blue"" layers a tiny little riff over
    a chugging chord progression, and works well until resorting to that most tired
    of devices, the bass and drums breakdown.

    81.8% of Everynight Fire Works, however, inspires nothing more than a yawn
    and bittersweet nostalgia.  The mediocrity reaches its apex with ""Quit,"" five
    minutes so lacking in hooks and creativity that it feels ten times as long, even
    before the textbook false-ending and buildup coda.

    Of course, it's completely possible that I've just outgrown the target audience
    for Nanna & Co.  Somewhere in Suburbia, I'm guessing there's a fifteen year-old
    kid just now discovering Hey Mercedes and thinking they're the greatest thing
    ever.  More power to little Ricky-- he could be listening to a lot worse.  And
    maybe my dissatisfaction means I'm actually disappointed and angry with myself,
    for outgrowing that rockin' inner teenager and becoming a crotchety old foge.

    No, wait, that's not right.  I'm disappointed and angry about Hey Mercedes'
    impossibly middling debut album.  Sorry, don't know what got into me there."
7492	14555	"After spending an entire North American tour supporting Broken Social Scene after the release of debut Some Are Lakes, you'd think that Land of Talk would be be eager to dial back the Canadian Indie Power Pop Bombast a little. Indeed, after the group translated some of the raw energy of its breakout EP Applause Cheer Boo Hiss into the more graceful, delicately arranged pieces found on Lakes, it seemed as if Land of Talk were destined to slip into the recesses of comfortable, regal indie rock. But with their follow-up Cloak and Cipher-- a fevered, grandiose record that's both denser and more technically proficient than its predecessor-- the Montreal trio take every opportunity to make their former tourmates proud with this batch of swoon-worthy, anthemic songs.If there's one thing the band does right on Cloak and Cipher, it's nail these big, star-bursted choruses. Powell, who acts as both the voice and chief songwriter of Land of Talk, has clearly allowed some of her time working with BSS to rub off on the material found here. While it might be a little dangerous to nick ideas from your new employer, the songs on Cloak and Cipher that sound the most like BSS tunes are the best ones here. Riff-slathered single ""Swift Coin"" sounds a lot like ""7/4 (Shoreline)"", while standout ""Quarry Hymns"" marries some familiar balladry with salted air and sunset-warmed guitars lifted from some late-70s FM station. It's a high-water mark, and one that best captures the band's intent to never allow the emotive moments to get the best of the blustery ones, and vice versa.Throughout, Powell remains a transfixing voice, and Land of Talk gives her the space she needs to try a variety of approaches. On an otherwise sad but endearing sounding little ballad, ""Color Me Badd"" (yep, like the ""I Wanna Sex You Up"" guys) finds Powell's softly spun vocal boiling-over with a controlled kind of lovesick frustration that locates a complex hurt. But most of the time, she doesn't need to rely on anything as dramatic, channelling a humbler, late-era Stevie Nicks on ""Playita"" or doing a less-precious Feist on ""Hamburg, Noon"".Cloak and Cipher wisely enlists and array of heavy-hitters, with guests from Arcade Fire and Stars pitching in where needed. While these helping hands provide added oomph, their reputations for drawn-out tracks and LPs has also seemingly rubbed off on Land of Talk. Those great choruses? Still great, but not when songs are dragged out this long and the payoff arrives right on schedule, about four times a song. It's indulgent, but it's hard to make songs sound this big. Fortunately, it won't be enough to wring-out the magic found in a great many of these songs, and surely won't be able to stall Land of Talk who, with Cloak and Cipher, are progressing quite nicely."
2434	20050	"This past January, Mary J. Blige appeared on a remix of Disclosure’s ""F For You""—an unexpected but instantly natural pairing that at the time seemed merely like a coronation of sorts for the legendary R&B singer. Instead it was a harbinger for both the individuals involved and the scenes they represent. As 2014 played out, the Lawrence brothers would see their breakthrough hit ""Latch"" become a surprise staple on rap and R&B radio stations, while Blige used her turn on ""F For You"" as the launching pad for a complete career digression—if not an overall reinvention.Her new album The London Sessions features primary collaborations with Disclosure as well as fellow British pop superstars Sam Smith, Naughty Boy and ""Latch"" songwriter Jimmy Napes. That it stands as one of the final major releases of the calendar year is fitting as a summation of R&B in 2014. As the sound of pop mutated into dance music a few years back, R&B lost its footing in the American mainstream, leaving even its established superstars in the lurch. But R&B clawed back some of its relevance this year thanks to danceable, appealing songs that didn’t immolate the genre at the altar of pop radio. Chris Brown’s ""Loyal"", for instance, was a massive hit, but more instructive in the context of Blige’s new album were Kid Ink’s ""Show Me"" and Jeremih’s ""Don’t Tell 'Em"", two hugely popular DJ Mustard-produced songs that showed a younger generation how R&B could fuse with house beats in a way that feels completely natural.All of this—from Mustard’s wizardry to R&B playlists finding room for ""Latch"" and Smith’s ""Stay With Me""—has helped provide a soft landing spot for Blige, whose career has been floating aimlessly for a few years now. Blige is nothing less than a titan of R&B music, but she had fallen into a trap familiar to many popular musicians two decades into a career: by trying to cling to the zeitgeist she was making music that felt stale. Blige’s albums since 2007’s Growing Pains have been patchy, and she hasn’t had a true hit single since that album’s ""Just Fine"".No single from The London Sessions has yet changed that latter issue, but as an album it certainly doesn’t feel stale. Instead, it’s a seamless and occasionally thrilling listen that establishes a fact many could have predicted: Blige’s throaty vocals, as passionate and emotional as ever, are an ideal fit for house music. Nonetheless the album doesn’t exactly play out how you might expect.For instance, it opens with a quartet of ballads, only one of which—a classic Blige self-help anthem called ""Doubt"", co-written with Naughty Boy collaborator Sam Romans—rises to the level of the album’s better, later songs. Despite Blige stoking the album’s narrative with its name and by listing six songwriters on its cover, we are eased into the album slowly, as if we are wading into cold water. It’s like Blige couldn’t bear for her core fanbase to immediately hear a four-on-the-floor beat. The real meat of the album comes after these opening tracks—the album opens with a few wobbly steps, making the sequencing curious at best.Then there is the matter of the big name collaborators. Disclosure and Sam Smith are the starry names here peeking out from behind the curtains, though they even get their moments in the spotlight in the form of spoken word interludes in which they gush openly about Blige. The thing is that, although these three might have been the inspiration for The London Sessions, their contributions don’t exactly stand out.""Right Now"", a Disclosure production with a Smith co-writing credit that was the first song released off the album, is not only one of the album’s most forgettable tracks, but it’s also so bland that it seems like Disclosure and Smith (along with Napes) were almost afraid to disturb Blige. Their reverence is clear in the clipped interludes—""To me she was this untouchable goddess,"" Smith says in one of them—but that too often translates to a sort of distance. ""Follow"", the other Disclosure track (though this time without Smith), is better, but with its simple skipping garage drums and rubbery bassline it still feels like a Disclosure starter kit.The Lawrence brothers are actually shown up by a few old heads. The album’s best track is ""My Loving"", which was produced and co-written along with Blige and Romans by R&B god Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins. The track is a pure '90s house throwback, and it’s the first song on the album that really seems to electrify Blige. ""I’m in heaven, every time you lay your body next to me,"" she sings early in the track, letting her vocals run just slightly. Blige is channeling dozens of great, and often anonymous, house divas here, and naturally she fits in their lineage perfectly.That song kicks off a run of tracks that really stabilizes the album. ""Long Hard Look"", which sounds like a take on Sampha’s broken keyboard confessionals, is the album’s best slow number. It’s followed up by ""Whole Damn Year"", another vintage Blige ballad that features quietly arresting vocals: ""It took a whole damn year to repair my body/ It’s been about five years."" Following that is the second instance in which the young kids get taught old tricks: ""Nobody But You"", the album’s second-best uptempo track, allows Blige to really belt a devotional house chorus, and she delivers. It was produced by UK garage forefather MJ Cole, who shows Disclosure how to stay out of Blige’s way with some clicking drums and piano chords while still giving her a song she can really sink her teeth into.The album ends with another ballad, one that suspends Blige’s voice over pounding, chunky piano chords and a blush of strings. It is a final reminder that even if the surroundings change, Blige can wring emotion out of her voice like very few people on Earth. That, 20-something years on, she found a new way of showcasing this is why she is who she is."
3298	19157	"Ire for the Seattle rapper Macklemore has obscured the thrift shopper’s pedigree. Before Macklemore was the poster boy for mainstream rap’s identity crisis, he was just another inoffensive, independent rapper, with a facile flow, a pleasant attitude and a real love for the genre of music he had chosen to work within. But give the guy a couple of catchy beats and suddenly he’s sprung to life as the vanilla oppressor of rap’s traditionalists, too approachable by half and more than willing to lecture hip-hop on everything it’s doing wrong. Those irritated by Macklemore will probably not think any better of his fellow Seattle resident Grieves, the cosmetic similarities between the two former collaborators actually doing a disservice to the former’s skills as a rapper. Both artists do share a jones for sentimental subject matter, rhyming with a down-to-earth demeanor that can border on self-congratulatory. Grieves, born Benjamin Laub, also sings his own hooks, and the piano-heavy beats he’s particular to place him somewhere between Slug and Jason Mraz on the musical spectrum.Winter and the Wolves is Grieves’ fourth album, promoted, like a kind of musical companion to the Liam Neeson movie The Gray, as being “about the instinctual fight for survival.” That struggle mostly makes itself known through reflective songs about the rapper’s life, including a batch concerned with the events of childhood and a now-defunct relationship. Laub is an intensely honest songwriter and the album is shot through with raw emotion, even when the subject in question seems innocuous. Grieves has a gift for melody and his best songs rise above their subject matter with catchy hooks and amiable, keyboard and guitar-laden production courtesy of San Jose’s B. Lewis.  “Astronauts"", a song about the losses that come with maturity, has a very sticky chorus. “Kidding Me"", while it has many of the self-pitying qualities that hurt Laub’s songs about relationships, has a soulful beat and a syrupy Mayer Hawthorne-esque hook.  But both songs are plagued by the unshakeable self-importance that dogs the record, with lines like “you don’t have to be a kid to believe or see potential in a pile of leaves.” There’s no doubt that Grieves believes in the things that he’s rapping about; the problem is that he doesn’t seem to have any kind of self-awareness or sense of humor in doing so.What is it about earnestness that can seem so irksome? To start, in a genre built on coded language and slang, the relative approachability of Grieves’ music feels facile, his lyrics and production simple in a genre that has historically prized complexity.  Add that to the fact that Grieves is a passable technical rapper, rather than a particularly compelling one, prone to rattling off lines like “I’ve been a bad seed ever since the ovaries” and you’re not left with much to sink your teeth into. The album is straightforward, but often so much so that it can seem as if there’s nothing below the surface.Grieves can be tough to bear when he’s cheerful, but he’s far worse when upset.  The break-up song “Over You” is the prototypical lament of the nice guy done wrong. I couldn’t help but compare the song to Fiona Apple’s “Werewolf"", a track that also uses a series of metaphors to explore a break-up; each comparison Apple makes seems representative of the actual complexity of a real relationship. By contrast, Laub’s most interesting move is the final line, “I just don’t know how to get over you,” presented like a Shyamalan twist, as if we weren’t expected to recognize the bitterness that the song is basted in.  The blandness of the subject matter with which Grieves works makes his songs broadly relatable: it’s easy to imagine listeners identifying with the feelings he expresses on Winter and the Wolves, especially given that a large percentage of the songs are legitimately catchy. Rap like this has always existed and, again, it's largely inoffensive—but when it becomes popular, it threatens to dislodge more complicated music. Macklemore’s success sets a precedent: it will not be shocking if one of Grieves’ new songs makes it to radio playlists. Hip-hop has traditionally been a forward-thinking space, where either lyricists or producers can explore difficult musical territory. The success of music that does not make use of the genre in this way, threatens rap’s progressive identity above anything else."

    though this is not to be equated under any circumstances with nothing.
    Logh work thereby, build on it.
    Google's built-in translator explains: Dirge, slow, ice falling rock
    shelves. But, global warming is imminent. America on Glacier National
    Park will no longer, you know. The hills across the valley of Logh
    were long and white.
    I say: On this, their third plate (oops, Babelfish again), Logh have
    created yet another sparse, precise slowcore epic with colossally
    imbecilic Swedish-into-English lyrics. On ""Destinymanifesto"" (yes, one
    word), singer/guitarist Mattias Friberg whispers, emo-wise,
    ""Destiny's dead/ I cut its head off."" On ""The Big Sleep"" (nothing
    like Chandler's L.A.!) he adds, ""Beauty hides in your eyes"" and ""I'm
    heavier than a broken heart."" No, really. On aptly titled ""Bring on
    the Ether"": ""Time is the enemy,"" which was my 12th-grade mantra thanks
    to MxPx. On ""Asymmetric Twins"": ""I wrote a letter to the king and
    queen"" and ""I set sail for the mystery in life"" and the glockenspiel
    goes do, do, do. Shall I compare thee to a winter's day in the land of
    the morning sun?
    There is a song-- notable because it's a song and not one average
    guitar lick repeated over and over and turned into an instrumental,
    like the album's opening and closing tracks-- called ""Trace Back the
    Particle"", which goes nuclear over the album's frosty, wind-chapped
    landscape. It's something to wake you up, at least.
    The album comes with a DVD of the band recording the album (live),
    complete with 5.1 surround. Watch the ice caps melt! With a Dolby
    sound system! What fun! Remember Sigur Rós? OK, of course you do.
    Remember Appleseed Cast? Well, maybe, yeah, fine. Remember Waxwing?
    Exactly. On second thought, good thing it snowed in Manhattan last
    night, turning my little apartment building into a Nordic ziggurat, or
    else I might have graded this Scandinavian paint-by-numbers too
    harshly."
12924	5675	"I'm still searching for the best way to drop the phrase ""spoken-word"" without sending potential readers running, because this collaborative mini-album between photographer-cum-poet Gerry Mitchell and the band Little Sparta dodges any stigma the tag might carry. For one, Little Sparta-- who craft a quaint rustic-yet-dark feel from acoustic guitar, violin, harmonium, drums, and enough minor-key preciousness to soundtrack a stop-motion Tim Burton feature-- would have no trouble carrying a record by themselves.  In some instances here they hint at what a Little Sparta record would sound like: Mitchell's muttered, cryptic rhymes and can barely be heard above the opener ""Scalpel Slice"", and he's not present on two instrumentals, ""Ruins"" or ""I See Life"", where the band digs deepest into its capabilities for melody and atmosphere.
    But yes, this can't be called speak-singing, just talk-talking; Mitchell is reciting full-blown poetry over Little Sparta's instrumentals. It would make for an odd reading unaccompanied, though. Listen to ""Mocking Mirror"", where his genial, welcoming voice turns into a convulsion as he barely spits out the words the word ""moon,"" then starts over from the beginning, like a fireside chat from an infirmed uncle or a beguiling old stranger in a hostel or a café. It's a strange touch that would only work on an album, creating the feeling of narration without any real narrative, just a few repeated lines in a thick Scottish accent and thicker tones of regret.
    Things start to shift with ""Skyscraper Housebound"". The band plays more repetitive figures, and Mitchell's placement of the words becomes conscious of the music, waiting his turn for the harmonium to finish its brief interjection before chiming in. It feels like an informal gathering of quick learners, trading off one another and slowly giving each other the proper space. On ""Carefully Constructed Ruin"", the band steps back into almost total ambience, a terse, wheezing drone behind Mitchell's most emotional moment on the record.
    The track with the greatest symbiosis is also the strangest. ""Even the Saints"" has Mitchell shouting just one syllable with every slow, staccato downbeat: he shouts, Eve!...En!...The!...Saints!...Don't!...Like!...It!... Here...!"" (you get the idea) until, finally, he ends the track by restating, in the flattest tone possible, ""No, really; It seems to be seems broken, or at least all fucked up, and I'm embarrassed by my efforts to survive here."" That last line may deflate the track's tension, but it also underlines the bittersweet and unpretentious territory they explore.
    Even if they're only truly together on the final track, these collaborators feed off of each other in strange ways, with an edge that keeps this from just poetry set to music. Neither Mitchell nor Little Sparta wants the limelight, and the record is better for it."
2443	19744	"""Guess what, assholes,"" began a Facebook post from the sporadic metal supergroup Old Man Gloom in early November, five days before the release of what was presumed to be their sixth record. ""The Ape Of God is two entirely different albums. If you downloaded some leaked shit, you don’t have either.""Working in cahoots with their new label, Profound Lore Records, Old Man Gloom had circulated an eight-track, 46-minute promotional download called The Ape of God, portraying it as their second release since ending an eight-year hiatus two years earlier. Reviews appeared, followed, as the band predicted, by back-channel leaks. That’s when Old Man Gloom announced that the version many might have swiped was a carefully edited combination of two albums sharing one name. The bait had been stripped of essential interludes and lengthier pieces. Both records, the band said, would arrive on their proper release date. ""The interweb has sucked all the fun out of releasing records and we wanted people to be fucking surprised by something again,"" Aaron Turner subsequently told The Quietus. ""At least we tried.""In one rather isolated online corner, a flood of vitriol, kudos, and schadenfreude began. Some fans praised the ruse’s ingenious simplicity. Others called Old Man Gloom ""douchebags,"" ""fascist pricks,"" and ""clowns,"" or pointed out that bogus promos meant to hoodwink critics and pirates weren’t as novel as the band might have hoped. Reviewers who had already invested time in the album’s early edition complained, somewhat legitimately, that they’d been cheated of their time while trying to do their jobs—that is, many suffered for the sins of a few. But the duplicitous release should have come as, at worst, only a slight shock; after all, what have Old Man Gloom done for the last 15 years but try to troll would-be fans? From the way they delivered The Ape of God to the fastidious and belligerent mess the dual albums themselves deliver, these 12 tracks are the most perfectly provocative Old Man Gloom have ever been.When they’ve existed at all, Old Man Gloom have thrived in a state of concrete fluidity. Each of their albums has been its own gyre of heavy elements, tumbling d-beat and doom, harsh noise and hardcore, stoner rock and psychedelic rock into exuberant if sometimes uneven anti-patterns. A mix of audacity and devil-may-care enthusiasm powered their earlier records; during the first three tracks of 2004’s Christmas, for instance, they moved from a near-collage of Neurosis and Pink Floyd to a grindcore outburst to an alien instrumental reverie that suggested a punk rocker’s take on the early tape works of Gordon Mumma. Somehow, it worked. It’s as if the parents of the members—Turner, Converge’s Nate Newton, Cave In’s Caleb Scofield, versatile drummer Santos Mantano—told the kids they could be anything they wanted to be when they grew up, and that the quartet continues to hold that assurance as safe as scripture. Old Man Gloom’s boastful inability to make up their collective mind about what kind of band they are makes them incredibly divisive. They are either adored or reviled. That seems to be the way they prefer it, anyway.The Ape of God thrills with that indecision, amplifying it through two albums that act as clashing, fraternal twins. The first set is the most streamlined Old Man Gloom effort to date, as the band moves through eight songs in 43 minutes. Hardcore bruiser ""Fist of Fury"" is aggression couched in antiphony, with the band bounding into straightforward pounce only to stop in perfect time for screams barked over beds of near-silence. ""Never Enter"" delivers the kind of jubilant, anthemic agitation that served as Fucked Up’s early calling card, while opener ""Eden’s Gates"" peaks in a fists-up, sludge-metal sing-along that seems to have crept north from the same bayou as Eyehategod or Down. But even the straightest bits here are demented and warped. That pummel of ""Fist of Fury"" arrives over an organ-and-guitar drone that only grows louder. And the two minutes of radical, mean post-punk that form the core of ""The Lash"" follow nearly five minutes of full-band improvisation, where Old Man Gloom seem to be fighting the symptoms of dying equipment. Its din emerges from the end of ""Simia Die"", a wordless anthem that condenses the power and poignancy of post-metal into a tune that takes a third of the time Pelican or Turner’s old Isis would need to reach such heights. They do that by suspending the motion of a burly riff, walloping beat and celestial choir until one definitive, romantic crescendo arrives. It’s perhaps Old Man Gloom’s best-ever rendezvous of impact and economy, a union generally not favored by such indulgent explorers.That’s the side of Old Man Gloom that arrives unfettered for the second set. The bulk of the disc was omitted from the more concise promotional tease; perhaps not coincidentally, it’s the half that renders The Ape of God essential. Everything that’s ever made Old Man Gloom captivating collides in these four tracks and 47 minutes. ""A Hideous Nightmare Lie Upon the World"" moves from a whirlpool of distortion and disembodied vocals into a tide of turgid doom. Scofield’s bass line is a menace, rebelling against Montano’s drumset like an angry stepchild; Newton and Turner’s guitars twist in and out of feedback-and-effects tangles, flipping between militant riffs and anarchist bedlam. Both ""Predators"" and ""Arrows to Our Hearts"" find Old Man Gloom playing hide-and-seek with the cores of their own songs, dividing the action between blown-out instrumental tangents and delightful detours. All Old Man Gloom albums have functioned in much that same way, but here, they mete the misdirection with new momentum. That is, though some of these songs last 14 minutes, they lag very little between start and finish.There’s no better example, and no better moment on any Old Man Gloom album, than ""Burden"", which opens set two. At large, it’s a punishing doom march, an unafraid parade toward an ever-widening abyss. But the quartet takes its time getting into formation, tinkering first with punishing feedback, static bursts, and riffs that seem to lampoon what’s coming next. For a work that lasts as long as many major motion pictures, The Ape of God mostly avoids monoliths, a consequence of Old Man Gloom’s varied interests. ""Burden"" is their one concession to the colossal. Extrapolated brilliantly for a quarter-hour, it’s a coup of force and focus.Old Man Gloom revel in the disorienting. As early as their debut, they spotted unseen through-lines between disparate musical realms and raced along them. That very approach has made them a hard sale, because quantifying, categorizing, or controlling what they hoped to achieve seemed so difficult. But the context for their brand of ruthless patchwork has increased in recent years, as the borders of once-obdurate niches and subgenres have been bled. Old Man Gloom sound a little less outlandish than they once did, then, less like separatists in a stronghold of one than early adopters in a land of intrigue and opportunity. Following the band’s 2012 return with the fine but slight NO, The Ape of God—in all its two-volume, high-volume upheaval—reasserts their eminence in that field. And guess what, assholes? They didn’t need two albums to do it, but it’s hard to resent such brittle riches."

    What an opportune time for a Fucking Champs release.
    Seems every Joe Indie's been losing their shit over some record with guitars
    that sound like they're playing violin parts, employing homophony, polyphony,
    counterpoint, and all those other concepts taught in any high school's
    state-mandated music appreciation class. Artists ranging from Mastodon to
    Ratatat to Marnie Stern have whetted the indie audience's appetite for tight-yet-intricate axe compositions, and the veteran Champs, composed of two
    indie-metal lifers and ex-Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green, make a case
    for the old guard on VI.
    In the past, this portion of a Fucking Champs review
    would be reserved for prog-rock apologies/pleas aimed at indie fans repulsed
    by shifting time signatures, modes, and advanced guitar playing techniques.
    However, with the number of ambitious, technically adroit albums released and
    praised today (c.f. Ys, Welcome to the
    Black Parade, Friend and Foe, etc.), you'd possess a lot of gall to
    dismiss the Champs as pretentious or esoteric. VI strips down the prog
    to an ingestible 2-guitar/drums setup, forgoing many of the spacey,
    Yes-influenced synths and flare of previous releases and instead narrowing its
    focus on more immediate hooks and transitions.
    ""The Loge"" kicks the album off on an
    accessible note, stomping through a series of melodic patterns not inherent to
    metal guitar but pretty ass-kicking all the same. Whereas a lot of math rock
    tries to obscure its nerdiness with stygian minor modes and excess distortion,
    this opener contains equal parts pomp and fist-pump, even during its palm-muted
    grinder of a bridge. The wistful ""Spring Break"" boasts its share of
    metal emasculating as well, bookending its middle rawk-out section with an airy
    guitar opening and carefree closing solo. The brief transitional tracks
    particularly flash a lot of nuanced ideas, such as the stately ""Abide With
    Me"" or ""Champs Fanfare"", both potential national anthems for
    countries that don't yet exist, or the eerily calm ""Insomnia"", one of
    the few instances of synths on the album.

    Of course, the threat of novelty still haunts the
    Fucking Champs, and with the recent explosion of Nintendo-core bands, that
    threat feels more real than ever. The intro of ""Fozzy Goes to Africa""
    sounds like the soundtrack for a pixelated, 8-bit kid embarking on his first
    RPG journey, while the remainder of the song stagnates on a seemingly
    never-ending meat-and-potatoes AOR riff. This prosaic plug-and-chug songwriting
    pops up in several other tracks, hardly tempered by the baroque King Crimson
    knockoff ""Dolores Park"" or the band's best stab at Xanaxed Madchester,
    ""That Crystal Behind You? (Are You Channeling)"". Still, VI serves as a fun changeup
    both to today's more doomsday prog-metal and hipster-approved electroclash
    fugues. The album, while technically proficient, packs enough surprises and raw
    energy to avoid rote Yngwie Malmsteen-esque ""songwriting"" tropes.
    Don't be surprised if this heady offering leaves you less eager to fire up your
    lighter and crowd surf as it does to fire up your TI-83 and take the math
    portion of the SATs.

6772	15313	"Whenever a groundbreaking post-punk band reforms to release new material, there's the inevitable tendency to compare it to their earliest, trailblazing efforts. In the best-case scenario-- say, Mission of Burma or Wire-- we may marvel that artists in their fifties muster the same intensity as their twentysomething selves. But for the recently reunited Feelies, such considerations don't apply. The Feelies' 1980 debut, Crazy Rhythms, is undoubtedly their most revered record, but it's also the outlier in their discography, a singular and still exhilarating blur of minimalist guitar jabbing and percussive propulsion that the band would never try to recapture again. When Crazy Rhythms' follow-up, The Good Earth, appeared six long years later, the Feelies were a very different band both in terms of personnel and purpose. By then, they'd swapped out their rhythm section and tempered their debut's hypno-rock clatter into a more relaxed, jangly groove that they would ride out for two more albums before disbanding in 1991.It's this second-wave iteration of the Feelies that resurfaced in 2008. And though the band acknowledged Crazy Rhythms' 30th anniversary by reissuing the album and performing it in its entirety at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, the experience has had little rub-off effect on Here Before. Rather than try to reconnect with their formative inspirations, the Feelies sound remarkably comfortable in the middle-aged skin on Here Before, which exudes the casual grace of old friends who greatly enjoy playing together and have long stopped caring about proving themselves to anyone. Here, the Feelies simply dig up The Good Earth's pastoral, post-Velvets power-pop-- a sound that ruled college radio airwaves in the mid-80s but which boasts few notable contemporary adherents-- and blissfully strum away as if they were performing in hammocks. And there's good reason to believe that, if we were to pay them a visit in another 20 years, they'd still be doing the exact same thing.Despite the myriad, knowing references to ""start[ing] again"" and ""do[ing] it some more,"" there's little sense of a band striving to make the most of a new opportunity to be heard, or trying to prove their relevance to a younger generation. The nerviest track here, ""Time Is Right"", seems to mock this very idea, with Glenn Mercer sardonically declaring, ""Gotta do something/ Get in with the crowd."" But even if the Feelies aren't exactly challenging themselves on Here Before, they still prove themselves masters of arrangement, strategically positioning key elements to give these seemingly simple songs a greater dynamic impact. Examples include the glorious guitar solo that pushes the accelerator on ""Should Be Gone"", the stop/start snare-drum triggers on ""Later On"", or the strange, swirling static in ""When You Know"" that marks a rare moment of discord in these otherwise serene surroundings. Perhaps the most sublime turn on the entire album comes deep into the deceptively downcast title track, which blossoms suddenly into a swooning chorus at the 2:40 mark and venerates the moment by featuring it only once. And in that instance you realize why the Feelies are still necessary in totally wired 2011: to reassert the virtue of patience."
17810	2429	"You know, we music journalists have to contend with a myriad of internal
    voices while reviewing. There's the simple, straightforward, credulous
    voice of the listener, who takes bands, songs and packages at face value.
    As a counter check, there's a savvier, hipper voice that considers music
    a constructed, made-up thing, sold to us by bands and manufacturers through
    advertising, press buzz and the ever-enticing promise of press photos.
    And, finally, there's a purely contrarian voice that plays devil's advocate,
    finding the easy path and countering it at every turn.
 This kind of intrapersonal debating occurs with every release, but rages
    almost uncontrollably in the instance of a talked-up offering. Because in
    such a case, it becomes so important to keep oneself from being swept up
    in embarrassing critical groundswell without dismissing a record that might
    be good just because someone else likes it. Case in point: Doves'

  Lost
    Souls

 , an album currently coasting on tons of buzz. Follow us as we
    take a look at three different approaches to reviewing the record, while
    revealing the secret tricks of the reviewer's game:


   Step One: Snappy, Superficial Introduction




  Straightforward:

 While, in the United States, electronic music is
    considered a new, arty, futuristic medium, it's been a part of the European
    palette for years. While Underworld seem spacy and abstract on these shores,
    they're a legit commercial force for our friends across the sea. What's more,
    techno's such a known quantity across the Atlantic that it's become strictly
    pro forma for any self-respecting rock band to incorporate a little 808 thud
    into their rock and roll mix.


  Cynical:

 After the ""electronica"" ""boom"" rose and fell like Keith Flint's
    spiky haircut, all the big fancy record companies-- and the attendant
    faux-raver acts to whom they'd promised the world-- had to find a way to
    shore up their losses. Thus, the awkward shotgun marriage of rock to drum
    machines, resulting in efforts ranging from lovely (Radiohead) to dull
    (Smash Mouth) to bizarre (Rolling Stones produced by the Dust Brothers).
    All in all, the experiment can be deemed a bust.


  Contrarian:

 Techno? Techno-rock fusion? Fuck that!



   Step Two: Introduce the Band




  Straightforward:

 A good, if somewhat surprising, example of the Euro
    tech-rock fusion is the debut LP from Doves,

  Lost Souls

 . Where
    most of the fusing has gone on in the rock camp as aging amp-powered
    dinos struggled for relevance, Doves' effort provides a rare example
    of techno-schooled musicians digging in the crates for inspiration.
    Having made their first splash as a straight-ahead club act called Sub
    Sub, this trio of blokes woodshedded for a long time, started playing
    anachronistic instruments you strummed, plucked and hit, and ended up
    with a collection of damn-near-normal rock songs. Of course, the
    tincture of their throbbing house-kid past lurks in the shadows all
    the same.


  Cynical:

 The latest group of cred-hungry beat monsters to cross
    this writer's desk are Doves, a frustratingly non-capitalized or articled
    threesome from the UK. Their record's got everything written in lowercase,
    there's a lot of noiry photos of a boxer, and the damn thing is called

  Lost Souls

 , all of which reeks of art (or, perhaps more aptly,
    ""ahhht""). Scowling in front of a cityscape, clad in flannel, and sporting
    ridiculous stubblefields on their faces, Doves look like they're running
    as hard as they can from their bow as Sub Sub.  There's a reason the single
    they released under that moniker never made it stateside, and I'm sure it
    had everything to do with the description ""M People-esque,"" which appeared
    in the press kit.


  Contrarian:

 Hairy, serious-looking songwriter types from England? Fuck
    that!



   Step Three: Flailingly Desperate Attempt to Describe the Record




  Straightforward:


  Lost Souls

 is nothing if not a sprawling,
    ambitious effort. Padded for U.S. arrival with three bonus tracks, the disc
    stretches out to more than 72 minutes, and I'll be damned if it isn't a solid,
    engaging effort throughout. Where the increased running time of a CD is
    usually more beast than beauty, the breathing room allows Doves to stretch
    out. Few of these tracks weigh in under the five-minute mark, and most of
    their durations are given over to jangling acoustic guitars and mid-tempo
    rhythms that, in places, resemble Mogwai's moments of plaintive contemplation.

 Tonally,

  Lost Souls

 reflects the after-after-midnight hours, as if
    the boys felt the need to document the hung over and blissed-out aftermath
    of the dancing-hours frenzy their Sub Sub days offered listeners years ago.
    That rarest of animals, a singing drummer named Andy Williams, wails
    discontentedly and virtually wordlessly over swelling and receding musical
    themes, while atmospheric keyboards and ominous samplework provide texture
    the barebones acoustic arrangements wouldn't achieve on their own.


  Cynical:

 The heart of the problem on

  Lost Souls

 is its
    overreaching ambition. Naming the first track-- the virtually instrumental
    ""Firesuite""-- after the famous four-song suite from the Beach Boys'

  Smile

 sessions gives it away instantly. Doves are, in both their tilting and endlessly
    sculpted sounds, after the same instrumental evocations Brian Wilson made and
    destroyed at the peak of his compositional powers. In most principle respects,
    this album is straight, rockist Brit-pop.  But the samples and keyboards serve
    only to dress up fairly conventional songs, as if to conceal their pedestrian
    nature.


  Contrarian:

 More Brian Wilson name-checking? Fuck that!



   Step Four: Track-by-Track Highlights and Lowlights




  Straightforward:


  Lost Souls

 , despite its reach and ambition,
    works best in its most conventionally melodic moments. The aptly named
    ""Melody Calls"" juxtaposes a typically languid vocal against an
    uncharacteristically jaunty guitar riff, and the result is a little
    radio-ready wonder.  Similarly, the title cut's deep, throbbing chords
    work as this melancholy work's catalytic center, distilling the band's
    mixture of atmosphere and song down to a kind of essence.

 Among the more adventurous tracks, ""Firesuite"" and ""Break Me Gently"" work
    best because of their carefully planned development and the skillful use
    of heavily effected vocals, which flesh out what could have been almost Dave
    Matthews-sized swaths of dull 'jamming.' But the stately ballad at the end
    of the album proper, ""A House,"" accentuates the songiness of this effort.
    These boys are interested in beauty, power, emotion and feeling. Not idle
    wanking.


  Cynical:

 Hey! He stole my stuff! Punk.


  Contrarian:

 Emotion and feeling?! Fuck that!



   Step Five: Summation




  Straightforward:

 Despite its excesses,

  Lost Souls

 offers a
    novel twist on the electronics-plus-rock-equals-fun-for-trainspotters
    equation. The tech-rock fusion isn't dead in the water yet.


  Cynical:

 Okay, fine. Even Brits can do something decent from time
    to time.


  Contrarian:

 Fuck England!

 Rating




  Straightforward:

 7.3


  Cynical:

 6.2


  Contrarian:

 Fuck numbers!

16895	7204	"A friend of mine manages a coffeeshop in Arlington, Virginia. About a
    month before I ever heard The Six Parts Seven's latest LP, the band
    played a rock and roll show there, opening for Denison Witmer.
    ""They were good kids, I liked their music"" she would later comment,
    ""but they need a singer.""

    Although not exactly among the indie-cognoscenti, I took my friend's
    comment as a critique of post-rock more generally. The genre has
    seemingly become the catch-all term to describe rock without words
    (excepting, of course, bands like Gastr del Sol). But when one
    pigeonholing buzz word manages to rope both Don Caballero and Sam
    Prekop, its descriptive utility is obviously suspect.  Avoiding a
    general critique of post-rock, though, allow me simply to pare it
    down a bit: The Six Parts Seven play delicate, subdued post-rock
    a la Rachel's or the Album Leaf. There-- is that better?

    Unlike many who have traveled the same course, The Six Parts Seven
    avoid the dreaded curse of droning boredom, executing their craft
    with a surprising and beautiful depth.  Compositions are generally
    guitar-based, formed from simple hooks and patterns repeated
    hypnotically.  On most tracks, the guitar hooks manage to sidestep
    at some point, allowing for variation in a bridge or interlude,
    or perhaps reprieve with a piano melody (as on ""Sleeping Diagonally""
    and""Where Are the Timpani Heartbeats?""). The guitar driving the melody
    is accompanied by a second axe playing background counterpoint.  The
    band also makes tasteful use of samples, as on ""Spaces Between Days
    (Part 4),"" where something that sounds like a bagpipe in reverse
    occupies the guitar's usual drone, repeating the same six-note patterns
    throughout.

    The compositions on Things Shaped in Passing are uniformly
    tender, reflective, and soothing-- the sort of record to soundtrack a
    Sunday slumber, or induce the same.  There's something very personal
    about the music, something evocative in the simplicity that invites
    closeness. It's really quite stunning.

    Yet, although the parts are strong, the album as a whole still comes
    up somewhat short since each track approximates the tempo and mood of
    its immediate predecessor.  It's as if The Six Parts Seven decided to
    write an absolutely perfect song for one occasion, then recorded
    slight variations on its theme eight times.  As a result, I'd recommend
    you either take Things Shaped in Passing in small bites, or
    listen for a few tracks and let it dissolve into the background.  Still,
    I'll contend that they do just fine without a singer, and that they've
    managed to create a pretty solid outing considering the current
    post-post-rock climate of independent music."
4303	17980	Sadgiqacea make no bones about their love for all things trippy and psychedelic, and those leanings color many of the spacey, serpentine riffs that make up the bulk of False Prism. The raw, crackling energy of their live show bleeds through, thanks to Chris Grigg’s hands-off recording technique and the album’s warm, breathable mix. Album opener “False Segments” starts off strong, zig-zagging into a churning neckbreaker of a riff. The next eight minutes unfold slowly and deliberately, channeling the best moments of early Baroness and elemental fury of Neurosis without parroting either. The weeping violin at the end is a nice touch, and ripples smoothly into “False Cross”, with its spare, tribal drums and lurching sludge riff. It’s one of the longest tracks on False Prism, clocking nearly 11 minutes, but also its most engaging; it ebbs and flows in waves of distortion, and both members share vocal duties, alternating between a litany of hoarse shouts, painful rasps, and mellow, almost chanted clean singing. It’s an epic and a funeral dirge, at once grandiose and terribly sad. The title track feels tame in comparison, with its muted chords, blastbeats, and cold black metal overtones. Even with its mid-song break into downtuned, downtrodden doom, it’s the most straightforward song on here, and the most unexpected for those who’ve not yet learned that Sadgiqacea aren’t much in the habit of playing things straight.
7522	14530	"For as closely tied as they were early on, it's strange how far apart indie rock and hardcore punk have grown. Early indie and art-rockers took plenty from hardcore in the late 1980s and early 90s, especially bands on labels like Touch and Go and Dischord. Coliseum's third album, House With a Curse, nods to that not-so-distant past. Since its last LP, 2007's No Salvation, the band has recruited a new drummer and found a new label, moving from metal-mongers Relapse to the post-rocking Temporary Residence. They use every opportunity on House With a Curse to give tribute to the turn-of-the-90s bands that helped to shape their sound, often by inviting the members of those bands to perform on the album.J. Robbins (Jawbox, Burning Airlines) mixed the album and even adds backing vocals on ""Blind in One Eye""-- and a hell of a track it is, surging in ways you rarely hear in indie while still toying with quiet-loud dynamics and unpredictable rhythms. The guitars throughout the album crackle with distortion, yet the melodies are always straightforward and clear, and Patterson's lyrics are discernible no matter how he sputters and yowls. He does go for nuance in his singing on ""Cloaked in Red"" and ""Perimeter Man"", but subtlety isn't what's remarkable about his voice. Instead, it's his guttural, gravel-gargling roar that would make John Brannon (Negative Approach, Laughing Hyenas) proud. The power of his voice makes a pretty decent nod to some underappreciated bands into something more forceful and emotionally resonant. Some more instrumental variety would have been nice, though-- after the high of the first few tracks wears off and the formula grows more apparent, change-ups like the long, tense intro on ""Man Was Never Meant to Fly"" turn out to be the bright spots of the album's second side.Trying to bridge the gap between modern and more aggressive early indie doesn't always work. The more earnest nods to indie and art rock, for example, seem like window dressing compared to the force of songs like ""Blind in One Eye"" and ""Crime and the City"". While Will Oldham is a man beholden to no genre or label, his contribution to the bridge of ""Skeleton Smile"" struggles to be heard over the jagged guitar leads and double-time rhythm of the bass and drums, and spotting guests like Jason Noble (Rodan, Shipping News) or Peter Searcy (Squirrel Bait) is a Where's-Waldo hunt without the aid of the liner notes. House With a Curse seems like a conspicuous move from metal to indie, but whether Coliseum reach new fans or not, indie rock at large benefits from the band's injection of energy."
16177	4060	"Around the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out, it seemed as if the members of the titular
    troupe could do no wrong and that the well of comedic genius might very well flow to the end of time. A
    string of diminishing films and the demise of Monty Python itself disappointed quite a few, but since its
    participants were still alive and kicking, so were the hopes of their fans. Eric Idle, along with John
    Cleese, stood out particularly, and Idle's work on the TV special, The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash,
    showed that there were enough good ideas left in his head to keep the faithful tuning in.

    Idle then pulled a John Lennon, appearing brilliant in group work, and briefly so after going solo only to
    punish diehards with an unbroken stream of mediocrity thereafter-- not least of which came during his
    short-lived stint on the U.S. sitcoms Nearly Departed and Suddenly Susan.  Now he's added
    another dubious chapter to his legacy with the album, The Rutland Isles.

    Posing as a brief excerpt
    from host Nigel Spasm's 168-part documentary on the namesake islands, Rutland Isles also seems to
    pose as something related to The Rutles, which it is not. In actuality, it's a rather tepid music-and-comedy
    record from a man who stands shamelessly beside Steve Martin and Robin Williams in the Love-Me-Because-I-Used-To-Be-Funny
    Club.  Merrie Olde national treasure though he may be, Idle never comes close to justifying his continuing
    existence with The Rutland Isles.  Worse: he traces that sadly familiar line washed-up comedians can't
    seem to avoid.

    Though this album isn't as bad as hearing a formerly respectable comedian like Robert Klein tell flaccid jokes
    about O.J. and John Bobbitt years after they were deemed exhausted by the lowliest nightclub hack, it does
    reveal Idle's regression into some terribly cheap humor. See if you can spot the gag in the following track
    titles: ""Penis Fish"", ""Gay Animal Song"", ""Muff Diving"", and ""Homo Semi-Erectus"". Give up? Here's a hint:
    they're about sex, and they're as obvious as can be, with ""Gay Animal Song"" sticking out like a tasteless,
    derivative thumb. It's not too hard to understand why Idle resorted to such reliable topics, though. Not
    much else makes a decent stab for attention.

    On the island of Paranoia, says our host, people are prone to
    saying, ""Look out behind you,"" though certainly not so often or so expectantly as Idle. Another gem is found
    in ""Killing for God"", a song that bravely breaks comedy's long silence on the hypocrisy of religion. Yet
    even if the contents frequently fall short of anything that could safely be called a mark, the crumbling
    legend behind The Rutland Isles should be given credit for one thing: spoofing those pompous BBC
    documentaries. It's just what this world needs."
6761	15306	"Lately, there have been a number of acts making variations on house music, loosely speaking, using acoustic instruments and ensemble techniques. Brandt Brauer Frick is probably the best known in dance circles, performing thumping, techno-inspired grooves with lineup of harp, strings, mallets, and other acoustic instruments (as well as the requisite laptop and 808 handclap). But there are also Nicolas Jaar, Wareika, dOP, and Kadebostan, among others; Elektro Guzzi, signed to Stefan Goldmann's Macro imprint, splits the difference between minimal techno and math rock with just drums, electric guitar, and effects. Hauschka's Salon des Amateurs is the latest addition to the canon. It has been made primarily with prepared piano, with understated contributions from múm drummer Samuli Kosminen and Calexico's John Convertino and Joe Burns.It might seem like a bold move coming from Hauschka (Volker Bertelmann), a musician who's best known for intimate, classically inspired recordings for chamber ensemble or prepared piano-- hushed, pretty, and sometimes bordering on precious. The point hasn't been lost on Hauschka himself, who spells out his status as an interloper in the self-effacing title. (It also refers to a club in the artist's native Düsseldorf where he presents an annual piano festival.) But he needn't have: Salon des Amateurs is an inspired reverse engineering of house and techno's fundamentals, replacing the music's familiar circuitry with steel wire and felt pads.By design, it's not really house music: There's no rhythmic quantization or bottom-heavy kick drum to appease club DJs. Compositionally, too, these songs are more ambitious than most club tracks, given to the kinds of harmonic changes that don't lend themselves to DJ tools. But it's not not house music, either. Despite varied rhythms and tempos across the album, steady 4/4 grooves are the norm. All the songs share dance music's fondness for
There are two main instruments here, Hauschka's piano and his computer. (Occasional percussion, horns, accordion, and bass synthesizer add color.) The piano he prepares, in the tradition of John Cage, with any number of small objects-- paper clips, clothespins, a packet of Tic-Tacs-- inserted between strings or laid across them in way that provokes strange, tinny timbres and harmonics. (You can watch him prepare his piano in a fascinating series of videos on NPR.org.) Thus the piano, or a few notes of it, anyway, can come to imitate growling synthesizer bass, congas, and spluttering ride cymbals.The computer is used as a multitrack recorder, allowing him to build each song in a succession of parallel lines. There is very little evidence of digital post-processing; it sounds, for the most part, like he has played each part in full in real time, rather than cutting and pasting phrases and fragments into a post-hoc collage. (For anyone interested in a really close examination of his method, you can download all 20 multi-track parts to ""Ping"" from Juno.) It sounds, for lack of a better word, organic. I don't mean that in a loaded way; some great electronic dance music is radically inorganic, fit together out of tiny snippets of isolated sound in such a way that emphasizes disjuncture. But this album, in contrast, feels natural, artless. There are no evident seams.The preparations give Hauschka an enormous range of timbres to work with, lending the music a wonderful sense of depth and texture, and tugging it closer to sounds normally thought possible only from electronic instruments. He also makes a good case for the piano as a percussive instrument, layering parts in short, repetitive bursts, indebted both to electronic music's syncopations and to the ""pulse"" minimalism of the 1960s and 70s. The influence of Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians and Terry Riley's In C is all over Salon des Amateurs, particularly in Hauschka's method of daubing on tone color, even if his sense of structure owes more to popular music.Ultimately, the album succeeds not in imitation, but interpretation, borrowing house music's rudiments and riffing on them until it takes the music somewhere else. Piano house is in vogue right now, but the vast majority of it sticks to a single sampled chord. This is something else. It isn't so much that it's a facsimile of house, with downbeats here and staggered chords there, but a way of assuming its voice, of learning its vocabulary and grammar, stumblingly, and embellishing along the way with ideas borrowed from jazz and pop and classical music. It's gleefully polyglot, confident even in its own clumsiness-- awed by the scope of its subject and humbled by its own limitations, but still bright-eyed and unstoppable. If you've ever, while learning a language, passed through a phase where every new discovery felt like a giddy eureka moment, you'll know what I'm talking about. Curious, constantly in motion, full of puzzle-like counterpoints and arresting chord changes, it's a joy to listen to, and one of the brightest, most invigorating records I've heard all year."
6786	15289	"Hanna is a film about a ""badass survivalist girl""; the Chemical Brothers have never seemed particularly badass, but it's fair to count them as survivalist, both because last year's Further was their best record in ages and they're the only act from the late-90s electronica boom making music anyone would want to listen to. The Chems are known for welding techno beats to a distinctly rock aesthetic, and for much of the past 10 years they have functioned exactly like a rock band: standard album-tour-relax schedule, few collaborations, monster festival-headliner gigs. (And they can refer to themselves as ""superstar DJs"" all they like, but their last widely available DJ mix came out in 1998.) For fans of the Brothers, Hanna represents the shockingly rare opportunity to hear a work by the duo whose intentions fall outside their longtime M.O. of making techno for rock fans.I haven't seen Hanna; it appears to be a thriller set in Eastern Europe with a young female protagonist-- gifted in the art of action-- who eludes a ruthless intelligence operative. Digitized techno mysticism has been a go-to soundtrack of choice for this genre ever since The Bourne Identity rubber-stamped Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" as the perfect mix of heady paranoia, Euro style, and kicking things. The Chems-- with their widescreen sound, relentless bravado, and sturdy belief in entertainment-as-art-- are well suited for this kind of work.Hanna sounds a lot like a standard Chemical Brothers album--
The soundtrack offers some of the hard-charging thrills the Chems avoided on Further, and it does so in an environment in which the onus of excitement isn't placed solely on the duo. This results in some terribly limp interstitial ""atmospheres""-- the Chems have never had the stomach for this kind of track; they sometimes seem bored (I am)-- but they add welcome contrast to their car-chase songs. Hanna aims for mystery and portent, a slight but welcome tonal shift from the band's urban, galactic edginess. The louche grooves of ""Car Chase (Arp Worship)"" are a bad fit for the steadily gaining tension they refer to, but its beefy synthesizer roundhouse is the album's most head-nodding moment. They can't help but pepper ""The Devil Is in the Beats"" with the type of goofily serious vocal nonsense (""Rock the beat!"") they've always traded in.Hanna mostly wins in the sea of Hollywood action soundtracks, but it's marginal as a Chemical Brothers album (I prefer it to their dry, overstuffed mid-decade works). The Chems have rarely acknowledged anything outside their own blinding neon aesthetic, which is to say that not only would the Chems never know they were in a creative rut, they would be unlikely to believe in ruts. Hanna doesn't represent anything more than a slight change-up from a group used to throwing fastballs."
6732	15350	"Earlier this month, the two men of Bass Drum of Death stopped by the Fuel TV studios in L.A. to shoot a pair of performances. One of those tapings made its way to every corner of the nerdisphere within the 24 hours that followed, while the other more or less disappeared into the void that is the Internet. Though their run through GB City jam ""Get Found"" was perfectly pugnacious, the other stint was backing exactly the kind of guys you want to back if web exposure's what you want right now: Odd Future bash bros and Fat Possum labelmates MellowHype.Overall, it was a relatively staid, unorthodox showing on Bass Drum's part. While Hodgy Beats and Left Brain shared all sorts of voodoo, Colin (first names only) kept time and John kept his eyes glued to his guitar, hair completely obscuring his face, never to be flipped or tossed. That spooky riff he burrowed into was just right, though. While the attention was clearly drawn to their one-time, insanely magnetic bandmates, Bass Drum of Death find themselves blending into an increasingly crowded field of neo-classicist rock bands specializing in fuzzy assault. Their own label even released a few of their more immediate forebears.One is Wavves' Nathan Williams, whose initial mixture of blown-out grunge nods and 1960s doo-wop melodies became the first in a slew of young, beach-obsessed artists hiding similar vocal hooks and rhythms in swamps of pedal-driven effects. But Bass Drum of Death's smashmouth approach also saddles them with easy comparisons to an even larger group of garage-rock kin. While they do dabble with the same arsenal of ooooohs and aaaaahs, ooooweeooooh's and shooby doo's that Williams has, this Oxford, Mississippi, duo sounds far more effective when whipping up an evil frenzy much like those of Ty Segall. These guys don't showcase a similarly thorough ear for songwriting, but as far as rock'n'roll feats of strength go, GB City, their debut, registers quickly.Its first half in particular is exactly what you want to throw yourself into at a show. ""Nerve Jamming"" opens shop with a set of puckered power chord shifts every bit as stomach-churning as those in the titular track that follows. The aforementioned ""Get Found"" has snarl to spare here, while ""Velvet Itch"" features a devil-horned, almost industrial rumble to it in which John's vocal performance catches fire. ""I talk to Elvis, I talk to Elvis in my sleep,"" he scowls. ""He said I'm cracked out/ Oh yeah, I'm cracked out/ But at leeeeeast, I got no-where to be."" While GB City's B-Side feels flimsy and empty by comparison, it also features the album's biggest hook (that of ""Young Pros"") and a song that feels like it could be this band's calling card: ""Spare Room"". It ganks that diamond-coated Phil Spector drumbeat we all know and slows it down to a hopeless crawl. They start tying it up in ropes of guitar and then-- low-end arrives in the form of a nasty, ridiculously feral five-note bass run that cracks the song open. What's inside is nothing but squall and darkness, not unlike everything their name suggests but only occasionally delivers."
12869	4007	"Hank's debut album, How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years, was one of those DIY surprises we're afforded a couple of times every year: A manic, scattershot pile of tunes salvaged from an alternate universe pop landfill, released in a limited edition that gave each copy its own unique artwork. It was a chaotic mess, but it was charming in its way, not to mention insidiously catchy.

    The follow-up, Ackrill/Venning '91 doesn't exude the same amount of curio charm that elevated its predecessor. It has its moments of inspired lunacy, but at 10 songs in less than 19 minutes, it doesn't have time to get its hooks in you, and the misfires loom all the larger. When you have a song that lasts all of 1:36 and consists of nothing but a woman singing, ""I do not not not not not/ Like getting fucked over by my friends"" over a couple of pretty basic garage band beats, it begs for context, but as it is, ""Getting Fucked Over By Your Friends"" is just pretty annoying. And amateurish vocals can be great, but there's a definable line between unstudied and just horrendously off-key, which is what the singing on the over-distorted ""Avoid the Docks"" is.

    It's not all bad, of course. At their best, Hank fit in pretty comfortably
    between Swell Maps and the Go! Team. The prophetically titled ""Danes in
    Peril!"" is a great opener, with a call-and-response between what sounds like a couple of cheerleaders and an old English wino over a sturdy acoustic guitar riff and New Wave drums. ""Lakeshore Report Diluted: Sources"" has a sort of mutant Northern Soul rhythm track and comes off like a Motown song after ten generations of enthusiastic in-breeding. Two slower songs are strangely ingratiating: ""Dark Country"" is a nice creepy crawler with some amusing spoken-word bits, a good bass part and simulated steel guitar, with the great refrain ""I dedicate this to all my dead friends,"" while ""He Forgot My Name"" overcomes its weird, childlike female vocals (not quite on pitch at any point) to create an oddly haunting atmosphere.

    Even with these peaks, though, there's a sense when the album comes to a
    close with the pinched fuzz-rock of ""My Non-Fights"" that something's
    missing, and the album isn't really satisfying. And anyway, this is music
    that most people will either love for its exuberant lack of discipline or
    hate for the very same reason, and something makes me suspect the former
    camp will leave wishing for a bigger dose."
11372	10248	"Ever since the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"", guitar groups have set out to capture the teenage melodrama of 60s girl groups. Most     recently, Britons the Pipettes broke hearts in matching costumes,     while El Perro del Mar cried Swedish tears into orchestrally fluffed pillows.     And don't forget Johnny Boy's ""You Are the Generation That Bought More     Shoes and You Get What You Deserve"". Some bands add the Velvet Underground     to the formula, whether in the sweet noise squall of the Jesus and Mary Chain     or the Concretes' misty Mazzy Starscapes.When I first encountered Lucky Soul, on last year's chic indie pop     comp The Kids at the Club, all I     could hear was the past. The London     sextet's thrillingly overwrought girl-group glamor is completely     unmediated by hipster weirdness; you'll find no Wes Anderson postmodernism on their debut     album, The Great Unwanted, so you can     leave your ironic T-shirts at home. The syrupy orchestration of ""My     Brittle Heart"", the group's first single, takes from Phil Spector's     ""Wall of Sound"" not the overly familiar drum patterns, but the grand,     open-hearted directness, as huge and as potentially embarrassing as first love. ""Liberty is wasted on     me,"" sings frontwoman Ali Howard, cribbing a line from 1991 Morrissey B-side     ""I've Changed My Plea to Guilty"". Another Lucky Soul single,     ""Lips Are Unhappy"" remembers the Motown lesson on amplifying emotion by     seeming to suppress it, as Howard calls for us to ""shake, shake, shimmy,     shimmy"" (for sure!) over sunny-day tambourine and velveteen harmonies.     ""I'm tired of keeping composure when I'm not supposed to feel sad,""     she sings on ""One Kiss Don't Make a Summer"". The tracks of her tears     are easy to trace.Still, The Great     Unwanted isn't the kind of album that leaves you walking out humming     ""Be My Baby"". Guitarist, primary songwriter, and arranger Andrew Laidlaw     pays more attention to composition than to homage, and Howard has an unshowy,     girlish voice that's nevertheless more polished than usual in indie pop, with     shades of Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw, and Petula Clark. She can cast a     spell over upbeat Northern Soul floorshakers like ""Getta Outta     Town!"" and bouncy     third single ""Add Your Light to Mine, Baby"". But she's just as     at home on decorous torch songs like guitar waltz ""Baby I'm     Broke"", aching finale ""The Last Song"" (with its reviewer-ready     ""the penultimate beat of the drum"") and the smoldering ""My     Darling, Anything"", which pours sugar in the singer's wounds with musical     puns about missed beats and a heart that goes ""skip-skip-skip""     like a scratched-up CD. It's the type of sumptuous bubblegum that made an     impressive showing on Pitchfork's ""The     200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s"" but rarely places on year-end     album lists.On ""The Great Unwanted"", Lucky Soul decisively align themselves with the uncool, a not uncommon move that rings true mostly due to the music's non-appetite for winks.     ""Look for us, we were the casualties/ Forever paying the price for a life     less boring,"" Howard proclaims. Elsewhere on the album, the toweringly     embellished title track from recent EP Ain't     Never Been Cool once again sides with the unfairly unloved. Which on one hand     could be viewed as commercially astute; the latest girl-group revival can't     last forever. Then again, that's where things get really poignant. Howard     has chosen whole-broken-heartedly to     stand among the pop-besotted, lonely souls to whom the Smiths addressed another     B-side, 1985's ""Rubber Ring""-- the huddled masses whose lives were once saved by a song. If we don't love her, who will?"
4954	17258	"Patrick Stickles announced Titus Andronicus' upcoming North American tour by proclaiming ""PUNK IS BACK."" I suppose it's only fair to point out this is a guy whose last record ended with a 15-minute epic based on a Civil War naval battle. (It also had a bagpipe solo.) But while ""The Battle of Hampton Roads"" and many other Titus Andronicus songs lack the structural qualities of punk rock proper, they more than compensate with a spirit of all-in commitment. This was music made without any sort of Plan B.It's understandable that Stickles would be flying the banner of punk for Local Business since Titus Andronicus couldn't possibly top The Monitor by going bigger. But while Local Business is no less ambitious than its predecessors, it's ambitious in a way that's more meaningful for the band as a working unit. This is the first time the lineup touring the record is the same one that made it, and you get the feeling their intent was to make a one-take road dog album. At that they've succeeded. But Local Business also marks the first time the band seems like it's holding something back-- like there is a Plan B.At the outset, you get an idea of how it might've been drawn up. The first three songs on Local Business are by far the strongest and perhaps coincidentally the most familiar-- a medley of opening duo ""Ecce Homo"" and ""Still Life With Hot Deuce on Silver Platter"" has been a staple of their live sets for some time, while ""Upon Viewing Oregon's Landscape With the Flood of Detritus"" was premiered as part of an anticipatory mixtape. Together, they align with the mission of Local Business by sounding more plug-in-and-play than even the rawest parts of The Airing of Grievances, something that could be knocked out immediately by five guys in a room and captured on tape without the need for narration, a brass section, or multiple tempo changes.These opening tracks still bear many of the characteristics of classic Titus Andronicus songs, with rhythms to beat out on your steering wheel, triumphant classic rock guitars, and Stickles showing off his underrated sense of tunefulness. Once he grabs a hold of a melody, he crams it with in-jokes and self-reference: ""Feeling like we live on a Diarrhea Planet"" is a classic Stickles-ism if you don't know he's namedropping his friend's band. In a rare event, Stickles actually repeats lines, and you can easily hear those key phrases being echoed by a room full of true believers. That sense of populism is crucial as the band juggles nihilism, existentialism, and misanthropy.The opening section is a promising glimpse of a more aerodynamic and blue-collar Titus Andronicus, but by ""My Eating Disorder"", their new attitude has begun to clash with old habits. As is his style, Stickles has been candid about his struggles with Selective Eating Disorder, and as a confessional, ""My Eating Disorder"" is admirable, enlightening, and incredibly brave. But as a piece of music, it doesn't pack nearly enough ideas to support its grand framework.""My Eating Disorder"" isn't really part of a narrative arc, but as the literal and figurative center of Local Business, it opens a fissure and everything else crumbles around it. The one-minute instrumental ""Food Fight!"" and the one-line rant of ""Titus Andronicus vs. the Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)"" are the type of songs that carried weight in the context of Titus' prior concepts, but here they add nothing. ""(I Am the) Electric Man"" was a lark when it was released online following Stickles' bizarre electrocution accident, and outfitted with glitzy showtune vocals, it's a welcome respite in between the autopilot angst of ""In a Small Body"" and ""Tried to Quit Smoking""'s agonizing blooze crawl.Most important, for a record whose title and purpose is to celebrate punk, DIY, and local scenes, there's little sense of their previous fun or community uplift. During ""In a Big City"", Stickles screams ""Now I'm a drop in deluge of hipsters,"" connecting with a sentiment on ""Still Life"": ""It's just me, lonely me/ and the other relevant dudes/ arrogant enough to believe this is developing news."" These are representative of Local Business' pervasive attitude, rife with the sort of sarcasm, gossip, and double meaning that dominates discourse in indie rock and its Twitter parallel universe.Cynicism is both healthy and necessary in this realm, and Stickles' bullshit detector is off the charts throughout much of Local Business. But as he wonders about his complicity or how this kind of social schematic has benefited him, the album becomes stifling rather than illuminating. Even he's not sure how much he has to add to the conversation, as so much of Local Business struggles with coming up with something new to say: ""Don't tell me that I was born free/ that joke's been old since high school,"" ""By now I think we've established/ that everything is inherently worthless,"" ""Yes, it's 'us against them' again."" As such, a record meant to solidify Titus Andronicus after the past six years of personnel churn ultimately sounds transitional. This could possibly work in favor of Local Business in the long run, and after two stone-cold knockouts in The Airing of Grievances and The Monitor, it's not unexpected for them to stumble a bit. But are they on the right track? The battle lines of ""us against them"" aren't as clearly drawn this time, and for once, Titus Andronicus sound unsure of where they stand."
12693	6910	"The late Arthur Russell's reputation still largely rests on his work as a producer of disco singles in the late 1970s and early 80s. There's nothing wrong with that. Russell rewrote disco in handwriting so fluid and personal that his stature would be assured even if that were all ever he did. But of course it wasn't. I think with time Russell's lyrical work-- one hesitates to use the phrase ""singer-songwriter""-- will only grow in stature, until it stands alongside his disco records in listeners' minds. But before his famed visit to Nicky Siano's Gallery club, and just before he formed his country (not country) band the Flying Hearts, Russell was on a modern composer's track, performing his (for the sake of ease, let's call it) minimalist music at downtown New York venues like the Kitchen.First Thought, Best Thought is the first example of Russell's instrumental work to be reissued by Audika Records, whose Steve Knutson has taken up the challenge of sorting through hundreds of hours of unreleased tapes. Like Audika's other Russell reissues, it features gorgeous sleeve design-- including a heartbreaking portrait of a forlorn-looking Russell, eyes sunken in shadow and cheeks mottled with acne scars-- and liner notes from Russell and the musicians he worked with at the time, in this case Ernie Brooks of the Modern Lovers. Unlike the other reissues, it features music that is both more and less compelling than the Russell listeners have come to know.The first disc contains the two-part ""Instrumentals"", which was planned to be a 48-hour continuous performance but was only ever played live in bits and pieces. The previously unreleased ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is a masterpiece, up there with ""In the Light of the Miracle"" and World of Echo as Russell's greatest achievements. It melts the bustle of urbanity into the ebb and flow of a Midwestern lake. (Russell was obsessed with bodies of water growing up in Iowa, the way only a landlocked boy can be.) Minimalist only in its repetition, which weaves more than it cycles, ""Instrumentals Volume One"" is not what immediately springs to mind when you think of experimental music from the 1970s. It's beautiful, for one thing. And it sounds like it was made by someone who switched the radio on every now and again. In it, you can hear the gentle lope, twanging guitar ostinatos, and sweeping strings of 70s soul, the crosstown yearning of someone like Bobby Womack. You can also hear the ghosts of Ives, Copeland, and all the American composers who located the soul of the country in the fields, the canyons, and the frontier spaces. Russell wanted to gently dissolve the distinctions between high and low, catching hell for bringing the specter of popular music into New York's avant-garde. But he also dissolved geography. The space across 110th Street became as wide as a wheat field.""Instrumentals Volume 1"" is worth the price of First Thought, Best Thought all on its own. Nothing else on these two discs is quite so beguiling, but the other pieces continue to reveal other sides of Arthur Russell. ""Instrumentals Volume 2"" flows out from ""Volume 1"", slowly stripping away the drums until the instruments melt into each other like the wax of multi-colored candles collecting in a pool. ""Reach One"" is a very early composition from 1973 which plays two Fender Rhodes electric pianos off each other with meandering results. (It's not necessarily an insult to call this juvenilia.) ""Tower of Meaning"", on the other hand, is an orchestral work of great refinement that cycles through slow, deliberate, not unpretty chords. It's the most traditionally classical piece on First Thought, though as always with Russell words like ""traditional"" and ""classical"" are relative terms. The set is rounded out by ""Sketch for the Face of Helen"", a rumbling bit of oily musique concrète that features a bleating tugboat.Audika's reissue program is an act of devoted, some might say obsessive, scholarship and curatorship that deserves every bit of acclaim it's received. Five years ago, the availability of Russell's work was limited to a handful of songs on the first Disco (Not Disco) compilation. With the unearthing of material that never left Russell's apartment and the careful repackaging of records out-of-print for years, it now encompasses a broader view of Russell's genius than even those there at the time could have known. The most amazing thing of all is that a huge iceberg of still-unreleased music lurks under the receding, placid waters of Russell's anonymity. Give Steve Knutson a knighthood or something already."
17475	2199	"Miles had a new girl.  Her name was Betty, and she told him all about what the
    kids were listening to.  Being a singer herself, she had some connection to the
    inside world of pop and soul, but mostly, she was just a lot younger than him,
    and was probably instinctively more drawn to that music than Miles was.  It's
    not as if Miles was completely out of touch with popular trends, but on tour and
    in the studio as frequently as he was, one could hardly blame him for receiving
    information second-hand.
    Betty told him all about Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and the Fifth Dimension
    (hopefully in that order), and he was keen to investigate the new sounds.  Years
    later he would brag about being able to put together a rock band that would blow
    all the others away, but he approached the idiom cautiously and methodically at
    first.  Additionally, Miles was getting insider info from his drummer, Tony
    Williams.  Tony was younger even than Betty Mabry, and although he'd come of age
    deep inside one of the most popular bands in jazz (even if jazz's popularity
    wasn't what it had been ten years previous), he had his finger very much on the
    pulse of hip new music.  Tony had especially enjoyed the new funk from James
    Brown and the boogaloo grooves being played by Jimmy McGriff and Richard ""Groove""
    Holmes' bands.  Betty and Tony were playing a key role for Miles Davis in the
    late 60s, even beyond their personal and performing ones.
The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions release details a six-month stretch
    in 1968-69 when the various advisors in Miles' life would see their seeds sprout
    into fauna so full of life and outrageous fertility that the face of his idiom
    would be forever changed.  Of course, the final product of all this investigation
    and experimentation has been the subject of countless essays on Miles' genius,
    but it bears closer inspection to reveal that the trumpeter didn't just up and
    create this music out of thin air.  He spent months in the studio rehearsing on
    tape, midwifing his ideas.  In late '68, Miles was a painter using one canvas to
    try and retry his masterpiece, continually repainting over areas where, though
    the ideas were fresh and the colors vibrant, the concept was yet immature.
    As a palette, Miles chose only the best primaries from two continents.  At the
    time, Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock were mainstays from his
    second great quintet.  Bassist Ron Carter had become so busy with sessions in
    New York that Miles had to find a replacement.  In between gigs in England, he
    saw Dave Holland's band opening for Bill Evans.  Miles was immediately struck by
    the young bassist, and sent word via Philly Jo Jones and his manager (Miles had
    the best connections) that he wanted Dave.  Elsewhere, when it became apparent
    Hancock was going to have trouble making a recording date, Williams recommended
    the young Boston native Chick Corea as a replacement.  This quintet (Davis,
    Shorter, Williams, Holland and Corea) produced the first tunes on this release
    in September 1968.
    ""Mademoiselle Mabry"" is a sprawling ode to both Miles' new girl and Hendrix's
    ""The Wind Cries Mary.""  Miles had started using electric keyboards in the studio
    almost exclusively by that time, and Corea's relatively conservative figures
    (when they aren't directly quoting the Hendrix tune), are the dominant timbre
    in this piece at first.  He hadn't picked up the Fender Rhodes piano that would
    color almost every tune Miles performed thereafter, and the primitive sounds
    produced here betray the band's uncertainty about where the tune (or their sound)
    was going.  Davis takes the first solo, similar to his exploratory efforts on
    Miles in the Sky earlier that year, over a non-groove from Williams' toms
    and Holland's steady, if rather static, low-end line.  One of the reasons sets
    like this are great is that you really get a feeling for the musicians' progress
    during that time, and if this tune is any indication, things had only just begun
    to get interesting.
    ""Frelon Brun"" gives a much better idea of the revolutionary sounds ahead.
    Williams wastes no time in hammering out a hard funk break from the kit, and
    Corea had apparently already learned the importance of the repetitive chordal
    vamp to this music.  Davis takes a short solo, as if testing the waters, which
    is followed by Shorter's seemingly more confident strides in funky acid soul.
    The music actually ends up closer to what the band played after Bitches Brew
    than anything on In a Silent Way.
    Two months later, Miles reconvened with the same musicians, adding Herbie Hancock
    on Rhodes to form a sextet, to begin the next phase of the trip.  The band played
    music closer to Miles' vision on ""Two Faced"": mystical, impressionistic
    soundscapes courtesy of the two-keyboard attack, subtle, though insistent
    drumming from Williams, and a by-then typically moaning, weary head covered by
    Davis and Shorter.  The band was also not afraid of stretching the tunes out to
    10, 15, or 20 minutes if it meant they'd find something useful along the way.
    Miles (with the help of producer Teo Macero) had discovered tape edits from
    progressive pop records of the time (Sgt. Pepper being a chief influence),
    and this tune, similar to ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's About That
    Time,"" was constructed from several stop/start fragments.
    Later the same month, Miles found yet another missing ingredient in keyboardist
    (and über-influence on the sound of all resulting jazz-rock fusion) Joe Zawinul.
    The two men had known each other for several years prior to these sessions, but
    Miles could only admire the Austrian's playing from afar.  Zawinul had made great
    strides in uniting jazz and soul with Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley's band in the
    mid-60s, even scoring a pop hit with ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.""  He also brought an
    earthy sense of melody and classicism to the mix, and would ultimately become a
    major architect for the sound of Miles' band.
    ""Splashdown,"" a previously unreleased piece of tense, Rhodes-led jazz-funk,
    was recorded with the first three-keyboard version of the band.  However,
    Zawinul's influence wasn't really apparent until sessions from a couple of days
    later, when the band played two of his compositions: ""Ascent"" and the subsequent
    concert staple, ""Directions.""  The former seemingly caught the band in transition,
    with its theretofore-unprecedented use of tonal clusters and rootless ""comping""
    from the keyboards, and an absence of any drum pattern at all, save an odd
    tambourine pulse.  ""Directions"" was another story altogether, as the band busts
    out of the peaceful into the wild.  This was the most ""rock"" Miles Davis had
    sounded like up to that point, and the two versions of the tune on this set are
    very similar to what Miles' concerts would sound like from '69 through the early
    70s.  Also of note on this session is that drummer Jack DeJohnette made his first
    appearance with a Miles Davis band in the studio, lending his distinct,
    high-energy stomp to the proceedings.
    The band went on the road for a few months after that, and returned to the studio
    in February 1969.  More changes: John McLaughlin had been recruited on guitar
    (another Tony Williams recommendation), and Williams had returned on drums.
    This time around, Miles was looking for what he called a ""groove album.""  The
    strategy was that the band would play a tune (on this session, ""Shhh/Peaceful""
    and ""In a Silent Way""), based on charts, but were free to explore what regions
    the performance yielded to them.  Afterwards, Miles and Teo would evaluate the
    pieces, and form the ""groove"" in Miles' head from whatever was on tape.
    The original, previously unreleased version of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" from that session
    will shock most people accustomed to the legendary In a Silent Way version.
    First of all, there's an exposition and melodic theme that was completely
    discarded in the proper version.  Also, the famous robotic hi-hat pattern doesn't
    even begin until almost five minutes in.  One of the surprises (some might even
    say disappointments) of this set is the realization that this music wasn't just
    the product of Miles' muse; there were hours of sessions and rehearsals before
    the band, Miles and Teo discovered what it was they were looking for.  The humble
    beginnings of this tune still have much in common with straight jazz, though with
    a markedly progressive bent.
    The same session yielded two versions of ""In a Silent Way.""  The first is very
    different to what ended up on the album, with a faux-bossanova beat and Holland's
    light-footed bassline supporting the classic melody line.  The second version is
    the version that was used on the album, with McLaughlin's heavenly solo statement
    of the main theme, and Miles' delicate answer.  The band also performed ""It's
    About That Time"" (definitely a fruitful afternoon) in what was essentially the
    final version, complete with tape edits and loops compiled by Teo.
    Two days later, Miles was back in the studio.  He had a couple of new pieces,
    ""The Ghetto Walk"" and ""Early Minor,"" neither of which ended up on In a Silent
    Way.  The first tune is a hard funk almost-blues featuring Joe Chambers
    laying down a slinky groove on drums, while McLaughlin, Shorter and Miles give
    up equally subversive solos.  Most interesting is the middle section trip-down,
    wherein the ghost of the session two days prior sneaks in with a little
    atmospheric feather float.  ""Early Minor"" is another Zawinul original that's
    indicative of the kind of hyper-impressionism he would play (with Shorter) with
    Weather Report shortly after making Bitches Brew with Miles.  It's also
    confusing as to just why this didn't make the cut for the original In a Silent
    Way release, because it features similar cascading Rhodes figures, and very
    nice, gentle pulse keeping by Chambers.
    The set ends with the LP versions of ""Shhh/Peaceful"" and ""In a Silent Way/It's
    About That Time.""  Miles fans didn't get to hear everything that came in between
    this album and its predecessor, so the sessions documented on this collection
    will make the leap from the cautious dabbling in rock textures of Miles in
    the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro to the full-blown jazz-opera of
    Bitches Brew.  These recordings seem a lot more logically arranged and
    planned.  This is good and bad: while few people would doubt the genius of Miles
    Davis as a player, composer and bandleader, it's evident that he was running on
    blind faith more than once during that time, and that he was learning on the go
    as much as his sidemen were.
    Part of the mystique surrounding this album, for
    me, has always been that it seemed to come out of nowhere, like a beacon of
    uncanny originality and visionary foresight.  Apparently, it did have roots, and
    while the music will always be some of my favorite from Miles, I can't honestly
    say that seeing the blueprints for his magic translates to the same sheer joy as
    did the end results.  But, it's still magic music, and it's still Miles.  The
    worst thing you could ever say about a set like this is that it's almost too
    educational, and of course, that's not really a criticism, is it?"
2629	19806	"""All those brash young studs/ They have no idea what it’s like up here,"" Danish punk Elias Bender Rønnenfelt moans over a rolling midtempo drag on the title track to Iceage’s brilliant third album, Plowing Into the Field of Love. The line first scans as a refined upgrade of the band’s usual alienation—a dark basement swapped for an ivory tower. But it also has the same sardonic self-awareness that coats the instantly iconic video for Plowing’s first single, ""The Lord’s Favorite"", which featured the really, really, really ridiculously good-looking Rønnenfelt and his youthful comrades smearing lipstick on themselves, taking champagne baths, and enjoying cocktails with (d)ice in their glasses. ""Part of me wants to hurt you/ Tear in your hair/ But I don’t do that now,"" the singer admits, staring into the camera and lighting a cigarette as the band takes on tricky cowpunk shapes underneath his voice; it is, at the least, a unique approach to acknowledging newfound maturity.Indeed, Plowing Into the Field of Love finds Iceage growing up on their own terms. Up to this point, they’ve developed incrementally, taking a knife to the rough-around-the-edges teenage fury of the 2011 debut LP New Brigade and cutting fresh, sharp ribbons of flesh on last year’s refined sophomore effort You’re Nothing. Essentially a bolder, somewhat brighter update of what came before, You’re Nothing contained few hints of the baroque terrain that Iceage are traversing now. But the dense lockstep drone that closed out that record’s ""Morals"" suggested that Iceage could slow things down without losing their dead-eyed sense of passion.On Plowing, Iceage make a radical shift away from their hack-and-slash past and towards what is, for them, unexplored territory—morose piano balladeering, sprightly country-rock figures, distinctly Irish-sounding drinking anthems. Their journey mirrors the transformation that the punks of the '80s underwent when devising the perfect alchemy of hardcore’s youthful burn and Americana’s weary shuffle (see Mekons, X, Meat Puppets). So Iceage aren’t exploring new sounds on Plowing, culturally speaking, but nothing they’ve done in the past five years suggested that they were capable of such a transformation. Despite the new approach, Iceage still sound like themselves, so when Asger Valentin’s mournful trumpet cuts through the rolling stomp of ""Glassy Eyed, Dormant and Veiled"", the most surprising thing about the instrument isn’t its mere presence, but how at-home it sounds amidst the band’s newly considered arrangements.A sense of steadiness, a measured approach to abandon, marks Iceage’s transformation from a very good band to a Great Band on Plowing. While New Brigade contained bursts of unexpected melodic sweetness, the gruesome You’re Nothing often sounded like it was held together with little more than congealed blood and matted hair. On Plowing, the band swings to the opposite pole, sounding threateningly tight even when walking the edge of full collapse, similar to '80s-era Sonic Youth’s balance of control and dissonance. Dark piano chords serve as an anchor for ""How Many""'s buzzsaw guitars, embracing a half-time tempo change at the song’s midsection that crashes through the burning scenery; ""Cimmerian Shade"" kicks off with a hollow pound courtesy of drummer Dan Kjær Nielsen, accented by guitars both brawny and thin-sounding that abrasively scrape against each other. Album centerpiece ""Stay"" somewhat hilariously opens as a waltz in 3/4 time, speeding up uncontrollably at the command of Rønnenfelt’s most operative, visually arresting lyrical aside on Plowing (""Hands/ Become thundering hooves"") before building to a furious burn that stands as Iceage’s finest moment of feral aggression. Plowing’s strangest moment, then, comes in the form of its most straightforward tune: ""Abundant Living"", the record’s only sub-three-minute song that one could reasonably listen to while skipping down a sidewalk. Jakob Tvilling Pless wields a jaunty mandolin figure over the band’s besotted sway, which takes on a Gaelic punk resemblance as Rønnenfelt promises in a miserable cadence, ""I’ll bring it all down here with me/ Soaked in alcohol.""Rønnenfelt’s lyrics are front and center throughout Plowing—partially a result of his improved English, as he told Pitchfork recently—and they paint the type of self-portrait you’d expect from a punkish youth in his twenties: fatalistic, ferociously inquisitive, drunk on the promise of tomorrow and even drunker on whatever’s flowing from the tap at this very moment. Images of absent fathers, prison cells, and drowning are evoked, and the album’s parting line—""I am plowing into the field of love/ They will place me in a hearse""—reads as poetically grim as the limited perspective of youth allows. ""I have a sense of utopia/ Of what I truly ought to do,"" Rønnenfelt proclaims in the middle of ""How Many"", and that sense of gritted-teeth naïveté comes to define Plowing Into the Field of Love as a whole. This is the sound of Iceage finding a balance between getting older and seeking immortality by way of leaping into an abandoned-lot fire head-first. It’s beautiful and ugly at the same time and, for now, Iceage have found their own unstable sense of peace."
6812	15242	"There's a sense of unfinished business surrounding Subtle, the Doseone-fronted collective who dabbled in high concept pop/rap crossovers that always seemed to fall agonizingly short of the wider audience they deserved. Their final record together, ExitingARM, felt like an overt push toward accessibility, mainly due to its adherence to finely honed song structures that were executed with zipped-up brevity. Subtle called it quits in 2009 shortly after ExitingARM failed to reach beyond their immediate fanbase, but one of its founder members, Jordan Dalrymple, has continued to develop various threads from that record with this first album under his Antonionian guise. It's short, with a combined runtime of just over 30 minutes, and works around the same catholic mash-up of pop, rock, funk, R&B, and hip-hop influences that his prior band thrived upon.The slightly clumsy moniker Dalrymple has chosen to adopt is a nod to the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, the Italian filmmaker who was prone to dabble in abstraction, despondency, and societal and personal dysfunction. If Dalrymple shares one aspect with his almost-namesake, it's in his partiality for the metaphysical, which is strung out across the opaque lyrics that are voiced throughout most of these recordings. This is an album that's all about feeling, of conjuring up a particular mood, where the words are an additional splash of color for the listener to decipher. Those song-based tracks are spliced up by two scene-setting pieces-- the opening ""The Desert"", which sets a baleful tone via compacted beats and great washes of treated harmonies; and ""The Desert Pt. 2"", the penultimate track that's about as close as Dalrymple gets to straight-out rock, with its fuzzy guitar and manically chanted vocal incantations.The wide stylistic gap between those two songs indicates the general direction of Antonionian, which ultimately fragments into different junctures with every new turn it takes. The vocal tone, pushed high into a falsetto range for the most part, works as an anchor of sorts, giving the album its only common motif, although it's difficult to feel grounded in an Antonionian ""sound"" at any particular moment. A case in point: ""My Mind's I"" is a jittery pop track that matches an aching lyric from Dalrymple with furious acoustic strumming and a sea of choral voices. This is followed by ""Vanquished"", a downcast ballad full of melodramatic cries, which in turn gives way to ""The Ride"", a light mid-range number that marries the soft-focus pop of Air with the quirky impulses of Bruce Haack.It might sound like a messy conglomeration of styles-- and it certainly takes more than a few listens to becomes fully acquainted with the Antonionian world-- but Dalrymple is a meticulous arranger who just about knows how to slot all the pieces together. Occasionally he'll plunge too close to outright homage; ""Into the Night"" is one-part Ladytron synth snarl and one-part Prince-circa-Parade airiness, while the following ""Fate's Not Particular"" is a disappointingly played-straight diversion into shrill indie rock. That taste for diversity is partly what made Subtle tick, but what's lacking here is the overriding edge that made that project work. In short, Doesone could conjure up whole worlds of possibility through a series of carefully obfuscated lyrics, but Dalrymple can't quite pull off the same trick despite adhering to similar methodology. There's a sense that he's meandering with no particular destination in mind here, which is fine if that's his only intent, but his prior work suggested he's capable of so much more."
13770	4599	"Feted label Ghostly International declared that this album has Kill Memory Crash ""ushering in a new era of industrial music with a calculated assault on the post-Warp electronic scene."" Superb, a call to arms for the factory unions to overthrow the petty, bourgeois pencilnecks who stare at their laptops during concert to emit neutered, pasteurized, and deracinated versions of glories past from the Warp Records Internationale of Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, and Plaid. What is the manifesto, my comrade? Simple: Pretend that the last 15-odd years of industrial dance music didn't happen and concoct music accordingly-- that is dance like it is 1990.
    True, the ""post-Warp"" zeitgeist could use a smack upside the head as it is still locked into the point where faster and more convoluted rhythms and harmonics are demanded. But I doubt that Kill Memory Crash's second release on a label that is sometimes guilty of being ""post-Warp"" will stamp an impact, as they play fairly generic, club-filler Electronic Body Music (EBM)-- the descendent of Skinny Puppy, Front 242, and Nitzer Ebb, translating industrial's mechanical rhythms and metal guitar grind into disco for sulking, malnourished vampires
    Kill Memory Crash are vets from Chicago's industrial/EBM underground who've sporadically released a few singles since the mid-90s. American Automatic  shows that their work could assist a Hollywood producer searching for the right background music for scenes when the hero cop marches into an ""underground club"" full of bikers, sneering dominatrixes, and hackers bent on world domination. The death disco strut of ""Demento"" marches along with fuzzed-out serial killer murmurings, clich?d computer garbling, and bass drops. Kill Memory Crash also kick in obligatory nods to metal with synthesized guitar riffs, although on the auto-piloted ""Battery"" they lack the belt-sanding friction of Ministry and KMFDM.
    To its credit, the group has a good ear for synth programming, as exemplified by ""Doorway Nine""'s flickering electro-funk melodies. Elsewhere, the duo adds murmuring deadpan vocals to a few tracks, disrupting those drones with DSP misfiring that snaps the listener awake. In all, it's like the band itself woke up from 15 years of sleep and picked up where industrial left off."
1800	20773	"Nothing about Ezra Furman holds still. He loads his albums with frantic energy and watches them burn down to embers. Unlike the wiry, anxious music his brother Jonah writes with the Massachusetts band Krill, Furman's music hides little behind metaphor or enigma. He'd rather spit out all his problems than wrap them up into something oblique. He's kind of a projectile singer, firing off barb after barb as soon as they come to him.A playful, hefty romp through folk, blues, and plain old rock'n'roll, Perpetual Motion People marks Furman's first release with London imprint Bella Union. It's his third solo LP, but it matches tempos more closely with Mysterious Power, his 2011 release with his old band the Harpoons. Throughout his catalog, Furman has penned plenty of songs about his struggles with mental illness and self-destruction, and Perpetual Motion People continues that theme with tracks like ""Haunted Head"" and ""Can I Sleep in Your Brain?"". It also breaches identity and politics and love and loneliness, and the inherent instability of each.Furman indulges a couple saloon-ready crooners, like the loose piano jam ""Hour of Deepest Need"", but Perpetual Motion People shines when it's at its most kinetic. On ""Lousy Connection"", Furman bemoans the emotional vacancy of a life that moves at lightspeed over doo-wop backing vocals and swinging saxophones; he promises his ""undying affection"" to whoever will listen, though he's worried that the whole world is caught up in ""a game of worldwide karaoke"". But Furman is a clever enough lyricist to hit home that paradoxical feeling of manic isolation in just a few words: ""There's nothing happening, it's happening too fast.""More than anything else, Perpetual Motion People feels like a rallying cry against boredom. ""I'm sick of this record already,"" he sings on ""Ordinary Life"". ""Let's wreck all the preconceived notions we bring to it."" Furman, who publicly identifies as queer and genderfluid, sets ablaze traditional Americana frameworks with a yearning to be seen and heard the same way he feels. The friction between his sources and the direction in which he points them sets sparks flying throughout the album. He calls out for bodily autonomy and self-love on ""Body Was Made"", while on ""Tip of a Match"" he barks about never admitting defeat, even in the face of a long overdue apocalypse.Perpetual Motion People can never sit right in its own skin, and that's largely where its charm comes from. Furman is the kind of singer who seems to have crammed so many ideas into his head he can hardly decide which ones should fly out of his mouth first. While he's deeply indebted to traditional sounds and familiar structures, he comes alive most when he's sewing fissures into the forms he knows so well. Perpetual Motion People comes with its share of misbehavior, but there's still more room left for Furman to thrash."
5363	16800	"Opening your first album in nearly 20 years with a song called ""That Time Is Gone"" is either bracingly honest or immensely foolhardy-- or possibly both. On Falling Off the Sky, the dB's invoke their long-ago heyday and acknowledge that they'll never be young again. ""Better wake up, wake up, wake up, that time is gone!"" Peter Holsapple exhorts the listener over a modified Nuggets garage groove. Despite that disclaimer, there's a familiar depth to the guitars, which don't jangle so much as they slice and pop and rumble. It's both a fitting reminder that they were always more at home in the studio than on stage, where they could tweak and refine their sound endlessly, and a nod to that long-gone time, the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the dB's were the best North Carolina band in New York, sprouting from the ashes of Sneakers and moonlighting in Alex Chilton's band and R.E.M. The dB's' first records-- 1981's Stands for DeciBels and 1982's Repercussion-- mixed paisley-strewn mod rock with prickly postpunk, sunny West Coast harmonies, Big Star pop romanticism, and the jittery jangle that was then becoming a signature of Southern college bands.After a handful of fine albums in the 1980s and one more in 1994, all of which were recorded under different lineups, the dB's went mostly silent, as the original quartet focused on various side projects and production gigs. In 2012, Chilton has passed and R.E.M. have broken up, but most of their peers, including the Feelies and Mission of Burma, have actually reunited. Rather than simply reliving past glories, the dB's are trying to create new ones on Falling Off the Sky. These songs may contain familiar nods to the past-- the members' tastes have remained constant well into their careers-- but they're approaching those influences from new angles and assembling them into new shapes. This is, naturally, their most grown-up album. The dB's capably make the case that these sounds can speak to middle-age contentment just as they once conveyed youthful discontent.The transition is smooth, so they're not embarrassing themselves. But in the case of the dB's, the happiness of men in their 50s turns out to be less compelling than the angst of men in their 20s. Lyrically ""The Wonder of Love"" and ""Before We Were Born"" tend toward the settled and the saccharine, and musically ""Far Away and Long Ago"" sounds like something you'd hear in an Athens elevator, at least until the drums come in and distract from the chintzy strings and staid classical guitar. Among so many mushy sentiments, Will Rigby's ""Write Back"" is a pleasantly surprising standout. He pairs a clever epistolary concept with a playful sense of self-deprecation, and his strange, mewling vocal turns the repetitive chorus into the album's liveliest hook: ""I'll never reply to your reply to my reply to your reply to my letter."" It's the sound of a man out of touch with technology, but also out of his depth in even the most casual exchanges, yet he conveys the romantic alienation with a sly humor.Perhaps more than any other song on Falling Off the Sky, ""Write Back"" hints at why we care that a band has reunited so long after its glory days: At their best, albums like this one have the potential to define a new perspective from which to view the world, one that can throw a band's older material into sharp relief. But the dB's don't redefine themselves as defiantly as they once did, so the best moments are the most specific ones, like when they sing about listening to Delany & Bonnie on ""Collide-oOo-Scope"" or lament a friend's failing health on ""She Won't Drive in the Rain Anymore"". But there's never quite enough of the everyday on these songs, which they almost admit on ""Send Me Something Real"". After making the title plea, however, Holsapple undercuts the yearning with too much self-seriousness: ""because I don't remember how it feels to be free and pure."" That angst-- experienced by musicians and listeners who've been consigned to the reunion circuit or the Collector's Edition treatment-- could be a compelling topic for a comeback album, but Falling Off the Sky misses the opportunity to explore that fear of obsolescence too deeply. Which is a shame. These songs are loud enough, but they need more dB's."

    the opposable thumb of rock and roll.  Now all the other bands can do is watch from the ground
    and be eaten by lions while Juno swings and climbs through the branches, making fists, building
    tools to evolve, and occasionally throwing feces at all those who oppose them.  With three
    guitars Juno has volume, and I don't mean in the decibel sense.  Although just to rub
    it in, they have that, too.

    Let's see what other bands have three guitars these days, shall we?  Radiohead.  They're doing
    pretty well for themselves.  Critics love to erroneously throw around the shallow moniker of
    ""the American Radiohead""-- a title that holds less water than a Saharan Bedouin's bladder on a
    steady diet of potato chips.   But with all sincerity, I'm here to tell you that Juno are the
    Radiohead of punk rock.
This is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes opens with a somnambulist's tired mumble over
    flumes of swirling guitar and typewriter percussion that brings to mind Rodan slo-mo crashing
    into My Bloody Valentine in bubbling, soft explosions.  Things excellerate quickly on ""Rodeo
    Programmers,"" a searing rocker that stabs hot guitars at your chest as Arlie Carstens sneers
    great lines like, ""I've got a time- bomb lost inside my chest"" as if he has two little Bob
    Moulds shoved up his nostrils.  ""Leave A Clean Camp and a Dead Fire"" begins in a crescendoing
    Cure-ish swell before blowing the dam open.  Similarly, ""January Arms"" floats on chiming,
    cherubic melodies before a jagged riff brings in the Saturn 5- sized rock.

    Dangerous and beautiful like Liz Hurley sitting on an A-Bomb during a La Jolla sunset, Juno
    swoop down on angel's wings before ripping them off and hurling them at your throat.  As you
    can tell by the number of times I've used the words ""guitar"" in this review, this album will
    take off a layer of skin before caressing you in lotion.  Guitar."
542	22177	“Seven years later and I got the same friends,” Lil Yachty croaks on “All In,” an enjoyable posse cut near the end of Summer Songs 2. Seven years ago I was 20, two years older than Yachty is now, and I remain friends with only about 25 percent of my social circle from back then—where does the time go? While Yachty is rapping about coming up to the top with his team intact, the line invites personal interpretation: What were you doing seven years ago? What was your life like at 18?Age plays a huge part in enjoying (or not enjoying) Yachty’s music. He shouts “We are the youth!” on the mixtape’s very first track; he calls himself the “king of the teens” on another song that sounds like superhero theme music. The Atlanta rapper has made some uncomfortable appearances on New York radio shows like “The Breakfast Club” and “Ebro in the Morning,” where he was prodded and treated with a whiff of condescension—the weird kid in class with red dreads who embodies a new movement that strikes fear in older people. It all seems like an unfair burden put upon a teenager who doesn’t really deserve such high-strung generational introspection and skepticism. While Summer Songs 2 is better than Lil Boat, his breakthrough release from earlier this year, the music is still too flimsy to garner such “what is wrong with these kids?” hand-wringing. That said, of his current burgeoning peers—guys like Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti, 21 Savage, and Kodak Black—Yachty is looking like the one most poised for crossover success. His dominant feature on the D.R.A.M. song “Broccoli” sits at #34 on the Billboard Hot 100, and his light-hearted persona often shines on songs that are loose and feature less rapping. Which is fine. He gets in trouble, though, when gunning for some kind of respectability in traditional hip-hop circles. “For Hot 97” mostly falls flat, because Yachty simply can’t keep up with the beat. He doesn’t command a verse as strongly as most of the guests on the tape, like Chicago’s G Herbo, who flattens “Up Next 3,” and Offset, who offers a silky verse on the woozy banger “DipSet.” In contrast, Yachty frequently falls off-tempo—it can be unpleasant to listen to. His high-pitched voice works in his favor on slower cuts but doesn’t blend well when he’s shouting and lagging behind the track. It’s a bit discomfiting—you want to root for the kid, but it’s frustrating to hear him undermining his strengths so frequently.Summer Songs 2 clicks into focus on spacey, weirder songs like the slow-blooming “IDK,” where Yachty grapples with sudden fame, and the despondent breakup jam “Yeah Yeah,” which features the oddly memorable passage: “Dick so good turn that ho to George/That mean she get curious.” Yachty cops to being a student of Soulja Boy and Lil B (see the #based philosophy of “Life Goes On”) but he’s also got a Tyler, the Creator sense of humor, from his irreverent videos to opening the album by impersonating his “uncle,” Darnell Boat, who sounds like a character from the “Loiter Squad” cutting-room floor. And something about the tape’s late run of songs, when things slow down and the beats wilt, reminds me of chillwave’s idyllic vision of the West Coast, all beaches and girls and sun-soaked afternoons—potent, dreamy stuff that appeals directly to the sensibilities of teens and college loafers. Yachty is delivering an aesthetic, which is catnip to some (mostly those 25 and under) and repellent to others. But if you’re locked in, Summer Songs 2 can be a lot of fun.On closer “So Many People,” after playing a series of wide-eyed, wistful testimonials to his music, Yachty lowers his voice to a near whisper while a simple, forceful drum pattern kicks—a startling moment of vulnerability, even when he boasts, “I just put both of my feet in the door/I did it two times faster than these other niggas.” It’s the kind of pathos you get from young adults—the confidence is there, but the insecurity and uncertainty of teenagedom still looms. If Summer Songs 2 buckles under the weight of an Apple Music imprimatur and deafening hype, try to think about being 18 again, when you only wanted to listen to yourself.
2911	19553	Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson, the Sheffield duo who record as Slow Club, have a knack for patient, confident evolution. Their debut, 2009's Yeah So, was a collection of peppy, straightforward folk-pop that earned the band comparisons to pairs from the White Stripes to the Fiery Furnaces; by 2011, they had moved on to a richer, more tonally diverse sound, one captured by their strong sophomore effort Paradise. The band's new record, Complete Surrender, continues their developmental trend: Taylor and Watson have taken a large, proud step into the world of soul.The transformation is comprehensive: arrangements move and swing, newfound emphasis is placed on rhythm, blooming horn sections hold court, and Taylor taps into a reservation of emotion and sheer vocal power that was kept hidden on the band's earlier records. But even as Slow Club moves from sound to sound with each new full-length, the core of their appeal—their unique relationship and vocal interplay—remains uncompromised. Taylor and Watson spend a lot of time singing about love and how it's won and lost, but they shy away from playing a couple or suggesting some unresolved romantic drama. Instead, they usually end up sounding like two old friends who share a powerful, purely platonic love, and have spent years singing together and for each other. That interpretation of their dynamic is complemented by their vocal strategy: they frequently sing in unison, eschewing harmony save for situations where special emphasis is required. 
16863	341	"Although us critics would lead you to believe that we are all independent, objective thinkers,
    the truth is that we're often very predictable marketing tools who can be easily manipulated
    by using a proper set of variables. And God Loves Ugly is chock full of critic yumminess:
    ""emotionally resonant"" lyrics that ""betray an inner-vulnerability""; ""minimalist"" old-school
    beats that ""shimmer"" with an ""understated grace""; the requisite indie record label that is
    surely a ""breeding ground for unearthed genius""-- you get the picture.  But a funny thing
    happened on the way to Atmosphere's coronation; instead of effortlessly wearing the crown
    of critic's darling, God Loves Ugly is a whiny, heavily affected mess that tries oh
    so hard, yet ultimately seems as empty and manipulative as the latest Ruff Ryders or Bad Boy
    album.

    For those of you unfamiliar with the Atmosphere plotline, Slug (born Sean Daley) is the sort
    of self-depreciating, slacker anti-hero that we've all come to love over the years.  Shit,
    slap a flannel on him, give him a guitar, and he could easily pass for a grunge god (MC
    Vedder, perhaps?). His resume includes a Midwestern upbringing that left him both disaffected
    and rootless, a failed romance that he endlessly obsesses over (a la Eminem's ""Kim""), and a
    streak of self-depreciation that both preempts any potential criticism and conveys a veneer
    of detachment and apathy (a modern hipster must).  Together with producer Ant and MC Spawn
    (who has since departed), Slug released one brilliant but underappreciated gem (1999's
    Overcast) and a string of widely heralded but rarely purchased EPs that were collected
    on last year's widely revered Lucy Ford.  After constant touring, Atmosphere silently
    became the 'next big thing' in underground hip-hop, a particularly impressive achievement
    considering the bi-coastal regionalism of the genre.  Their recent show at San Francisco's
    Slim's drew one of the largest hip-hop crowds the place had ever seen. What's more surprising
    is that a majority of them were the under-21 suburbanite crowd that has made Eminem so popular.

    So the expectations for God Loves Ugly have been very, very high.  And it doesn't always
    disappoint: ""Blamegame"" boasts some of the dopest dub on the mainland; ""Hair"" is an amusing
    enough account of an initial foray into groupie-land; and Slug injects the album with some
    great lines. On ""A Song About a Friend"" he raps, ""It'll all be so simple if I were rich, but
    I'm not/ So I compensate with thought/ I got a lot of nothing that you need to know.""  And the
    moments of pseudo-philosophical, backpacker-attracting navel-giving are still there. On ""Loveline""
    he ponders: ""A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell/ The border in between is full of everything
    you felt.../ Everytime I look within I recognize the darkness/ Familiar to the image of the artist.""
    Deep, yo.

    Really, all the elements that made Lucy Ford and Overcast so hot are still present.
    But whereas those two albums sounded like the intellectually complex basement revelations of an
    emotionally exhausted yet stubbornly resilient young man-of-the-world, God Loves Ugly has
    a forced and formulaic undercurrent that, despite how hard I tried to look past it, was unmistakable
    and pervasive.  No longer are we hearing the confessions of Sean Daley. Those sweet, innocent days
    have been replaced by a more violent malaise seemingly calculated to resemble a certain white rap
    phenomenon who melts in your mouth and not in your hands.  Instead of Slug, we have the caricature
    of Slug: a deeply disaffected young man who, in ""The Bass and the Movement,"" even makes a somewhat
    tepid attempt to flex, threatening those who don't feel him to ""stuff them full of dick 'till the
    hole rips."" Good fucking God! That's almost as nice as Tyson telling a reporter that he was going
    to ""fuck [him] up the ass 'till [he's] not a faggot anymore.""

    Aside from the album's faux-aggression,
    I can't help feel that Slug has dumbed down some of his sentiments for the sake of accessibility.
    ""The Modern Man's Hustle"" may be Atmosphere's most popular song to date, but it's also their most
    easily disposable. Even Ant's beats have lost their charm. Instead of being delicate, lo-fi
    constructions, they now sound monolithic, commercial, and just plain boring. ""Flesh"" even resembles
    a bouncier D12!

    I really hope that I'm wrong about all of this.  I hope that what I'm hearing on this album's just
    growing pains-- the transition from the private to the public and the self-consciousness and
    uncertainty that goes along with that. I still have much love for Atmosphere and will be quick to
    pick up their next effort.  They have mad talent, no doubt.  And although I'm sure that God Loves
    Ugly will be their best-selling album (maybe even allowing them The Big Crossover), artistically
    speaking, this is Atmosphere at its damndest."
4324	17989	"Whether they were dismantling the divide between rock n’ roll and acid house, or simply regressing into Rolling Stones role-play, the Primal Scream that broke overground in the early 90s had little use for politics, their ideology no more developed than the Spinal Tap-ian maxim of “have a good time, all the time.” It would take the death of Lady Diana, of all things, to bring frontman Bobby Gillespie’s working-class roots and proletariat sympathies to the fore. In the wake of the fatal car crash that claimed the former Princess of Wales, concerts across a grieving U.K. were cancelled en masse-- including a handful of Primal Scream dates in London, the promoter of which claimed the band were kiboshing “out of a mark of respect for Diana.” This came as news to the band, who issued a reactionary retort claiming, “We wanted to play... We have no respect whatsoever for Diana Spencer or any member of the English Royal Family. We are totally opposed to the monarchy.” Accordingly, the band’s next album, 2000’s XTRMNTR, was Primal Scream's most angry, aggressive work to date, a brutalizing assault on ruling-class privilege and right-wing ruthlessness fought with industrial-strength, big-beat ballast and nuclear-grade distortion. (The latter came courtesy of auxiliary member Kevin Shields, whose earwax-melting mixes of “Accelerator” and “MBV Arkestra (If They Move Kill ‘Em)” made the decades-long wait for mbv a little easier to endure.)But rather than signal a change in the band’s consciousness, XTRMNTR’s politicized fervor proved to be as much of a passing phase as the Sticky Fingers-licking of 1994’s Give Out But Don’t Give Up. While XTRMNTR’s primary concerns (war, greed, inequality) would dominate newstickers over the ensuing decade, Primal Scream’s albums over that stretch found them aesthetically adrift, shirking topicality for white-lined electro decadence (2002’s Evil Heat), refried roots-rock (2006’s Riot City Blues), and day-glo pop gloss (2008’s Beautiful Future). And where the band had heralded each of the previous two decades with a game-changing tour de force, they spent the turn of the 2010s restaging 1991’s rave-rock masterwork Screamadelica to sold-out crowds across the U.K. So when Gillespie sings, “What happened to the voices of dissent/ Getting rich, I guess?” on More Light’s epic opener “2013”, he could very well be singing to himself.Coincidentally enough, Primal Scream’s political reawakening immediately follows the death of another notorious British figurehead, Margaret Thatcher. But while the Iron Lady is derisively name-dropped a handful of times on More Light, her passing didn’t exactly inspire Gillespie to lead a chorus of “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead” through the streets of Glasgow. Notwithstanding the shameless rehash of “Movin’ On Up” that is current single “It’s Alright, It’s OK”, it appears the most tangible effect that the recent Screamadelica remount had on More Light was in reinforcing the dispiriting sense of how little the political landscape has changed since the former was first released.The result is Primal Scream’s most impassioned, holistic, and ambitious album since XTRMNTR, though this time they’re not so much interested in toppling oppressive institutions as devising the psychic survival strategies required to withstand them. Tapping the heady, cinematic sensibility of producer David Holmes, and compensating for the exodus of long-time bassist Mani back to the Stone Roses, More Light presents Primal Scream at their most lustrous and expansive, foregrounding acoustic elements-- unplugged guitars, saxophone, string-section flourishes-- but shaping them into swirls of sound every bit as dense and disorienting as their more electronically focused, dubwise efforts.“2013” may import its dystopian “21st-century slave” mindset and Kevin Shields-supplied screech from the XTRMNTR playbook, but it forsakes camouflage gear for kaftans and keffiyehs, with a snake-charmer horn refrain and a sand-swept, acoustic-guitar groove that alternately surges and dissolves over the course of its nine mesmerizing minutes. Holmes’ wide-screened influence is most perceptible on the album’s long tracks, over which the Scream carefully set the scene before deviously destabilizing it: “River of Pain” is a hushed, Beta Band-style psych folk workout that gradually drifts into the path of an orchestral free jazz tornado; “Relativity” is a raging-raga attack on complacency (“You’re fucking next!/ Condemned to repeat!”) that gets detoured into a moonlit Midnight Cowboy sway. And to the producer’s great credit, even the songs that most flagrantly dip into the blues-- always a danger zone for this band-- retain an absorbing atmosphere and gritty edge, like the empty-bottle-kicking, back-alley strut of “Tenement Kid” and the grey-scaled gospel of “Elimination Blues”, the latter coloured by some lemon-squeezing “uh huhs” from guest Robert Plant.If these subdued songs channel XTRMNTR's agitated spirit in more oblique ways, other tracks make the connection more explicit: The spectacular, sax-scrambled “Hit Void” is the sequel to ""Shoot Speed Kill Light” we’ve been waiting 13 years for, inheriting the latter’s Autobahn-bound rhythm but stomping on the accelerator and scraping the guard rail until the sparks fly; the hypnotic stomp of ""Sideman"", meanwhile, chisels a proper song out of the jazz funk haze of ""Bloody Money"". However, “Culturecide” would be a more credible civil-disobedient counterpart to “Exterminator” if it didn’t have a title and hysterical chorus cry (courtesy of the Pop Group’s Mark Stewart) that sounded like it was cribbed from an Atari Teenage Riot record. And the upbeat 80s-Stones glitz of “Invisible City” sounds as out of place here as the band’s rollicking cover of Hawkwind’s “Motorhead” did on Vanishing Point, ranking it a distant second in the pantheon of city-themed Gillespie/Holmes collaborations. But More Light’s sprawl is ultimately its greatest virtue, its fusion of dreamy acoustic psychedelia and white-knuckled krautrock propulsion serving as the connective tissue between the blissed-out and bludgeoning extremes of this band’s unwieldy discography. With the Screamadelica nostalgia out of their systems, More Light primes the Scream for their fourth decade in the best possible way, serving as a summary of everything they’ve done before, yet sounding nothing like it."
3748	18629	Doomriders are largely known as the rockier side project of Converge bassist Nate Newton, who handles guitars and lead vocals in this quartet. Compared to the Massachusetts hardcore institution's compelling, tightly packed explosives, anything else would seem “relaxed,” but carrying over Converge's focused barrage to Doomriders works against Newton on this latest release for Deathwish, Grand Blood. Across these 11 songs, Newton doesn't allow himself or the band to loosen up enough to let the material breathe, and this is the kind of stuff that really does want to let go and rock. Really, the collection has the potential to appeal a number of different audiences—Converge die-hards, Motörhead speedfreaks, Southern Lord hardcore kids—but partially on account of its stuffiness, falls short of those marks.The first full song, “New Pyramids”, feels like an outtake from an All Pigs Must Die session. In Doomriders' defense, they don't seem to take themselves quite as seriously as APMD, but the intensity still isn't there. Despite their reputation as a “rocking” band, they don't really go for a “rock song” until the third track, “Mankind”. It's not a terrible song by any means, though it would be best used as music played over the PA while Red Fang sets up. Doomriders have been described as “death 'n' roll” in some circles, but there isn't a whole lot of “death” in the equation. A feral touch wouldn't hurt. “Death in Heat” sees the band going into doomier realms, and if the production was a bit nastier, it'd make a great closing to a Nails album.On the subject of Nails, Blood was produced by Newton's Converge bandmate Kurt Ballou. It's not as thick as his other productions, and if there's anything positive to say about the album, at least it's not a smattering wall of indiscernible riff-noise. The most egregious offense is “Gone to Hell”, which sounds like a ploy to go for Baroness loftiness without fully committing. Say what you will about Baroness, they have their niche carved out, and Doomriders can't say that because of Blood's unevenness. Even the intro feels like a waste of half a minute. (If you're looking for an intro done well in hardcore, Pharmakon's work on Hoax's latest album is the place.) What's the use of going several different directions if you don't hit the goddamn dirt on the road?In 2007, Doomriders released Long Hair and Tights, a split with Japanese experimental metal trio Boris. Boris are a group that's waded in many different sounds, and pulled them off successfully most of the time. Ambient drone, Stooges-like primal rock, riffy J-pop, and noisy hardcore—that worked well enough to ward off detractors.Doomriders could have learned a lot from them, and Grand Blood could have been the rare record to go broad by not giving a fuck. Instead, it's the dude who has a lot of tattoos that conceal the fact that he's as boring as the rest of us, eating at chain restaurants and watching ABC comedies.
9438	12549	"I have no idea how much effort Neil Halstead puts into writing his songs; for all I know, he's secretly slaving over every chord change. But across a few decades and three projects, he's made it sound remarkably easy, like these tunes just drop out of his sleeves on slow afternoons. That's the common thread running through his work, from Slowdive (the dreamy English shoegaze act he started with) to Mojave 3 (a brand of dreamy Americana) to his solo records (on which he barely seems to have changed out of his pajamas)-- he writes sleepy, graceful pop songs like there's no higher calling on earth, and all signs suggest it comes naturally. A guitar, a handful of chords, and a lilting mumble, and he always provides something that works.Oh! Mighty Engine is his second solo record, following 2002's well-liked Sleeping on Roads. That first album's name seemed apt: Halstead's music is good company for travel and sleep both. This new album's name isn't so apt, though, either in its old-folkie implications or the suggestion that there's any kind of internal combustion involved here, any aspiration toward the ""mighty"". This record comes to us via Brushfire, Jack Johnson's Hawaii-based label, and the fit's a surprisingly good one: Years away from those stylish shoegazer days, Halstead passes awfully well as a beardy beach-bound slacker, standing contentedly in Californian sun instead of English rain, a guitar on the passenger seat and a surfboard on the roof.And this record, I'm guessing, sounds a lot better if you live someplace where you can drive barefoot, interact with natural bodies of water, own multiple large dogs, or see stars at night. Mostly it's just Halstead and a nylon-stringed guitar, recorded with warmth and space to spare, cooing about fireflies and seeing the good in people. You might think it was an insult if I said I'm occasionally put in mind of Jackson Browne, but I'm betting Halstead wouldn't; after all, Jackson Browne wrote Nico's ""These Days"", and I suspect Halstead's trying to do something similar with ""Sometimes the Wheels"". Shakers, light drumming, pedal steel, and a few keyboards swoop through, but none of them are looking to mess with the heavy lidded vibe of Halstead's songs and harmonies, whether it's the lush, sunny ones or the starker, darker, Nick Drake-style numbers. These sounds fill up a space beautifully, it's true, hushing all other noise in a way that's hard not to feel contented by-- and decent melodies still seem to be dropping out of Halstead's sleeves as reliably as ever. Put some of these songs on, and you can nearly feel yourself standing in a big empty house on a warm evening, can nearly smell the tea lights.Only... where oh where's the ""mighty""? Even if you haven't been following Halstead down these lines for a while, you might find yourself annoyed by that contentedness, or by the laid-back commonplaces of the lyrics. This is the problem with the beach bum as artist, after all: You get a lot of vague reassurances concerning what life's like (and stabs at bemused charm like ""Baby, I Grew You a Beard""), but never do you get anything in the way of fire, of fear, of desolation, of crisis, or of real human detail. Oh! Mighty Engine is endlessly pleasant but oddly faceless, a record strangely free of feeling. Maybe grand gestures just aren't what Halstead's selling with his solo work, sure; there's nothing wrong with soundtracking people's breezy nights this well, especially as a sort of side project. But think back on the records like this that really stick with you, and it's always the ones with a face, a strangeness, an ineffable quality that sets them apart. There are times when Halstead really has that, but this isn't quite one of them."
4768	17417	"There's no need to have been alive in the 70s to be very familiar with 70s hard rock. The music has lived on with enough ubiquity that even if you've never gone near classic rock radio, you've probably heard it over the credits of a TV show, or playing in the supermarket, or on the car stereo of a teenager born in 1996. It's the top-level stuff you'll hear, of course: Zeppelin, Free, Cream, Deep Purple, Van Halen... those bands sold millions of records, but trailing in their wake were hundreds more that would have been happy to sell out a private pressing of 500. Enterprising reissue labels and so-called sharity bloggers have done much to shed light on this music in the last 10 or so years, and it feels as if we'll never run out.Once you fall into that world, the pull of the rabbit hole seems to increase exponentially. This is an effect surely felt by Andy Votel and Doug Shipton, the compilers of Man Chest Hair, a set whose cheeky title references the English city of Manchester, host to a thriving hard rock scene during the 70s. The two collectors have brought together a rough assortment of tracks documenting the era here, focusing entirely on rock bands of low-to-no commercial fortune. One of the joys of exploring this old music is discovering the incredible diversity of sounds that can exist under a single generic umbrella like hard rock. The groups here range from straightforward boogie outfits to heavy prog, proto-metal, almost-punk, glam, and down-the-middle pop rock acts, with hints of folk and blues as well.Certainly, the Man Chest Hair title is worth more than a bad pun: nearly every musician heard here was male (JC Heavy's vocalist is the lone exception), and this stuff was recorded during the wild, shirtless heyday of loud rock and roll, before punk taught people to be ashamed of ambition, or to at least act ashamed of it. No, these bands were aiming for the cheap seats in venues where every seat was cheap, or there were no seats at all. Oscar, a band that also played under the name Royal Variety Show, open the disc with ""Good Lovin' Woman"", which was likely selected to go first because it sounds like some sort of cosmic mean of 70s hard rock. It's got a bit of funk in its step, a lot of crunch in its guitars, ample cowbell, lusty vocals, and free-spirited attitude that roll together almost every quality that put this music on the top of the heap in its original moment.The biggest highlight for me is ""King Dick II"", by the Way We Live. The song has a great, cycling riff, kicked along by busy but ruthlessly effective drumming, and the lyrics encouraging you to ""practice witchcraft with your friends"" are a pretty hilarious send-up of both hippie ideals and the panicked reaction to them. This band changed its name to Tractor, released a great album, and then settled into the festival circuit, which makes them one of the longer-lived acts on the compilation. By comparison, So On and So Forth hasn't even received the honor of a Rate Your Music entry, though their cover of Cream's ""Sweet Wine"" is quite a bit better than the original. Same goes for the excellently named Urbane Gorilla, whose buzzy sax/guitar riffs on ""Ten Days Gone"" help compensate for the amateurish vocal and turn the song into a thrashing stomper.Not every song is a winner. Stackwaddy, one of the better-known bands included here, turns in a lumbering, momentumless plodder on ""Hunt the Stag"", and the demo-level quality of other songs doesn't serve the big sounds these groups were aiming for particularly well. These are more than balanced out by the presence of unearthed gems like Grisby Dyke's ""Nebula"", which veers wildly from heavy prog instrumental passages topped by flute, and folk-y, waltz time verses. Likewise, Slipped Disc switches things up a bit with their funky, harmony-flecked ""Come On In"", a song that was clearly pointed toward the charts, even if it stood little chance of hitting them. (Their vocalist also sounds ever so slightly like Robert Wyatt.)Man Chest Hair occasionally drags, and can't boast more than a handful of tracks that will flip anyone's lid outside of 70s rock enthusiast circles. One does wonder if there were more fully realized gems that got passed over in favor of more obscure, unissued material when this set was being assembled. I'll extend the benefit of the doubt to the compilers and suppose that they picked what they thought best told the story of a city alive with rock and roll during the brief window in which hard rock truly ruled the world, and the upstart bands that trailed in the wake of Led Zeppelin thought they might be able to secure just a bit of that power for themselves."
13337	6256	"Now this is a terrible Liz Phair record. Somebody's Miracle is mostly generic pap that any number of next-big-has-beens
    could have cranked out, a useless piece of plastic poking a pointy heel in the eye of the carcass of the artist Liz once was.

    Sound familiar?

    I know I may be in the minority 'round these parts, but I actually like Liz's 2003 self-titled trainwreck.  Yes, it's desperate and
    confused and comes on to you like the mom in American Pie.  For all of those reasons, I find it quite fascinating and
    entertaining, not to mention provocative.  I mean, we're still talking about it, aren't we?  When was the last time you got into
    an argument over Stephan Mathieu & Ekkehard Ehlers' Heroin, which Pitchfork reviewed the same day as Liz Phair,
    and gave an 8.6?  Isn't that why we fell in love with Liz in the first place, because she made us angry and uncomfortable?

    In hindsight, the 0.0 bomb was wasted on that album, because it's much better than Somebody's Miracle.  The chief complaint
    about Liz Phair seemed to be that its rockers were sticky-sweet Matrix-pop at its best-- cheesy, tacky, glamorous, and yes, radio- and
    MTV-friendly.  People complain that ""Extraordinary"" and ""Why Can't I"" are Avril rip-offs, but now that we all agree ""Since U Been Gone"" is a masterpiece, maybe a few more people should rip off Avril.

    Rather than weather the storm and stick to her guns, Phair eschews her pop fix completely for Somebody's Miracle, an album
    that is ""adult"" in the worst sense  of the word-- the sense that gets ""-alternative"" or ""-contemporary"" tacked onto it by radio
    programmers.  It's not so much ""mature"" as is it safe, nice, settled down.  These songs are perfectly content to get up every
    morning, go to work, come home, eat dinner, watch the news, have 10-minute missionary-position sex, and then fall asleep.

    Opener ""Leap of Innocence"" swaddles the chorus melody of Liz's own ""Polyester Bride"" (from her underrated 1998 album whitechocolatespaceegg)
    in wide, bright heartland-rock chords, as Liz moons over The One That Got Away.  Blah, whatever!  And why does it sound so weird?
    The disconnect between her flat voice (the pitch corrector has clearly been set aside-- she's completely off-key) and the shiny
    production gives the song the feel of an unfinished overdub, something to be scrapped or cleaned up later.  Although, at least it's
    not boring, which is more than can be said for most of the 13 songs that follow.  The title track, ""Count on My Love"", and lead
    single ""Everything to Me"" soak up Sheryl Crow's sun, get lost in John Mayer's wonderland, and oh, how they remind me of Nickelback.
    In fact, so do most of the tracks stinking up the back end of this tedious, over-long calamity.

    Of course, not everything on Somebody's Miracle sucks like Maroon 5; a few songs suck in other ways.  ""Wind and the Mountain""
    starts out promising, with appealingly vulnerable verses about, appropriately, not living up to expectations, but by the chorus it's
    a self-help serenade, all we're-gonna-get-you-through-this Dr. Phil crap.  ""Stars and Planets"" seems to be making some sort of
    statement about the Big, Bad Music Industry, but the Teletubbies-happy chorus (""We all shine! Shine! Shine! We all shine! Shine!
    Shine!"") and overzealous bounciness of the rhythm make it the kind of earworm that sends people screaming to Wolf Eyes.  ""Table
    for One"" is a trite, oversimplified acoustic lament from the perspective of a doomed alcoholic.  Only someone armed with the pipes
    of Trisha Yearwood and an artillery of Nashville session musicians could save it.

    There are two decent songs on Somebody's Miracle, and that's why you aren't staring at double zeros once again.  On ""Got My
    Own Thing"", Liz purrs in her best tomboy about how she don't need no stinking true love, since the guy she's got is doing just fine
    for now.  ""Why I Lie"", meanwhile, reaches back to Phair's old slippery sense of melody and penchant for self-deprecation. ""And if
    you ask me why I hurt you/ I don't understand it/ I can't help myself/ It's a special combination/ Of predatory instinct/ And simple
    ill will,"" she sings over a clip-clopping beat and Stones riff, sounding not the least bit apologetic but, frankly, kinda bored.
    Ahh, there's the Liz we know and love.

    Just as naysayers were quick to blame the Matrix for Liz Phair, it would be all too easy to point fingers at Phair's
    collaborators on Somebody's Miracle-- namely producers John Alagia and John Shanks.  Between them, they've twiddled knobs
    for the Dave Matthews Band, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Michelle Branch, and Celine Dion, which explains pretty much everything.
    On the other hand, Shanks has worked with Hilary Duff, Pink, Ashlee Simpson, and Kelly Clarkson, and co-wrote ""Come Clean"", ""Pieces
    of Me"", and ""La La"", so Phair could certainly have chosen to continue experimenting with teen-pop.  Either way, she took the helm,
    and as such, the successes and failures of Somebody's Miracle fall squarely on her shoulders.  Would she really want it any
    other way?"

    The good news for Iceland's Múm is that they sound noticeably different on Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy, their first album following the departure of founding member and vocalist Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir. Earlier this year, we heard her one-of-a-kind voice moving backwards in collaboration with her husband, Avey Tare of Animal Collective, on the tape-direction experiment Pullhair Rubeye. Now her former band returns, with several members of the now seven-strong band pitching in vocals, including male leads for the first time. The bad news is that, despite some encouraging changes, the band seems to be struggling to find a fresh point of view to go with their new line-up.
    Múm still have a way with texture. The 95-second confection ""Rhuubarbidoo"" nicely blends horns and melodica with synthesized music box sounds. Strings and harp give ""Marmalade Fires"" a regal cast. ""Winter (What We Never Were After All)"" is close to Enya-style ethereality, with a small chorus of vocals singing wordlessly over a steady throb of distortion and light-streaked drone. To those who have followed the band's career from the beginning, Go Go continues to explore their distinctive sound world and finds (somewhat) interesting ways to integrate traditional instruments with electronics.
    The best example of this comes with ""Dancing Behind My Eyelids"", released as a single earlier this year, which opens with a subtle synth pattern that combines percolating, underwater-sounding bass tones with a slight twinkle of bells. It's an instantly effective set-up reminiscent of their first album Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Was OK, on which they managed to evoke a tangible sense of place on almost every track. When percussion and accordion fall in and the tempo increases, we find ourselves inside what is probably the best ""pop tune"" (though only of a sort) the band has written. The song has an appealingly dramatic sweep and delivers on the electronic folk ambitions they've hinted at from the beginning-- and best of all, the vocals even exist in service of the track.

    ""They Made Frogs Smoke 'Til They Exploded"" is another effective hybrid, with its intentionally awkward, tumbling drum programming, blasts of harmonica, wordless kiddie vocals, and bright, 8-bit synths. Elsewhere, we hear bits of the currently fashionable Eastern European influence, perhaps carried over from the Storsveit Nix Noltes project, an Icelandic collective paying tribute to the music of Bulgaria that includes members of Múm.

    Unfortunately, the advance songs we heard from Go Go are probably the two best tracks here. But while this is certainly not a great record, it probably has broader appeal. The last two Múm full-lengths seemed bent on a return to the womb through cloying titles (""The Island of Children's Children"", ""Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes Closed"") and Valtýsdóttir's baby-like coo. The band didn't just reference the concerns of early childhood, they longed to inhabit them, to make the music sound like it came from that pre-pubescent place. While the lyrical concerns haven't really changed here, they come at them with an appealing sense of distance, allowing an easier ""in,"" for whatever that's worth.

3021	19447	"Chrissie Hynde has been making records for over three decades, but until now she’s never released a proper “solo” record. Under the guise of the Pretenders, Hynde operated as the leader of a constantly evolving gang, a dynamic that always seemed of paramount importance to her. The power of the Pretenders hinged explicitly on Hynde's personality and musical force, but she always made clear that the Pretenders were a band, and that she was no solo act—so Stockholm, the first album Hynde's released under her own name, represents a left turn for her career. Stockholm was recorded in the album’s titular city with Peter Bjorn and John's Björn Yttling, who also co-wrote most of the songs and contributed guitar; the record also features contributions from Neil Young, the Caesars’ Joakin Åhlund, and—most inexplicably—tennis legend John McEnroe. Despite its wily pedigree, though, Stockholm is a relatively staid affair. Hynde’s voice remains one of the most distinctively emotive in all of rock music and, to his credit, Yttling has the good sense to always place it high in the mix. Still, Hynde’s vibrato is too often matched with bland lyrics and production that's overly glossy.Hynde is at her best when delivering withering, offhand indictments, so “Dark Sunglasses” is one of the album's treats. Dismissing those who have traded their integrity for the cache of coolness—“A kind of glamour you can lend yourself/ Like dark sunglasses/ And you'll remember how good it tasted/ Inside the ruling classes”—the song hints at the kind of thorny, playfully acerbic persona that has made Hynde such a force to be reckoned with throughout her career. Unfortunately, on Stockholm, Hynde’s usually effortless badassery too often gets buried under forgettable tunes. There is a weird irony in hearing Hynde sing “I’ve become what I criticized” on “Down The Wrong Way”, a track tugged along by Neil Young’s blistering guitar work but dogged by a sing-songy chorus that would've barely made it as a Pretenders B-side back in the '80s. “You or No One” and “Sweet Nuthin'” are serviceable pop exercises, but they also lack any discernable bite, trading in clichés rather than revealing anything interesting about Hynde herself—a shame, since she’s arguably lived a very fascinating life. It’s only when she seems to let her guard down, as in the lovely album closer “Adding the Blue” that Hynde’s genius shines on Stockholm. A doleful, truly beautiful attempt to memorialize a past love, it’s a stunning reminder of how Hynde’s voice can make even the simplest lines truly heartrending. When she sings “I can't draw from memories or photos/ I need blood and breath, but you left me nothing,” it’s as stirring a moment as anything from her expansive back catalog; ""Adding the Blue"" also leaves one wishing that the rest of Stockholm could have been as emotionally arresting.In Stockholm’s press materials, Hynde says, “I wanted to make a power pop album you could dance to—Abba meets John Lennon.” It’s frustrating that the results don't match the aims; here, she’s made a mostly fine, overly polished adult contemporary record that feels oddly generic, especially coming from her. At this point in her career, Hynde has sold more than 25 million records, so she has certainly earned the right to do whatever the hell she wants. Still, for someone capable of crafting truly perfect pop songs like “Talk of the Town” and “Message of Love”, the treacle that shows up time and again on Stockholm is confounding. As a distilled 5-song EP, Stockholm might have served as a refreshing slap in the face—a potent reminder of what a vibrant jolt of lightning Chrissie Hynde can be—but instead, it's a rather wan listen. She remains one of rock music’s most fantastically singular talents, but with this experiment now behind her, maybe it’s time to get the old band name back together again."
6599	15471	"My Morning Jacket have always been something of a mythic outfit. Back in 1999, when the band released its debut LP, The Tennessee Fire (and again in 2001, after the release of At Dawn), its legend was whispered quietly, like a ghost story: Kentucky, grain silos, reverb, that high, liquid voice. As 2001 was the apex of a certain kind of dark, New York City cool-- with the Strokes and Interpol slouching around the Lower East Side in threadbare t-shirts and tiny ties-- My Morning Jacket were steeped in a warm, eerie other-ness that culminated, cathartically, with Jim James howling ""All your life/ Is obscene."" Well, sure.In the ensuing decade, the band became legendary for its heroic live show (in 2008, they stormed through a near-four-hour set at Bonnaroo), but its studio work has always been a little less triumphant. On record, My Morning Jacket can sometimes sound like a band struggling against its own best interests, purposefully eschewing the exact thing-- huge, ghostly, terrifying rock'n'roll-- it does so disarmingly well. Accordingly, the reigning press narrative surrounding Circuital, MMJ's sixth LP, has been focused on the band's supposed ""return to form,"" a response that feels like a direct reaction to its title (or, more likely, to 2008's falsetto-addled Evil Urges, easily the band's most divisive record).But what are they returning to, exactly? My Morning Jacket’s early discography is rooted in oddball experimentation: Despite the open-mouthed riffing, impenetrable reverb, and whipping hair, they’ve never really been a straightforward rock band, especially on record. Jim James' penchant for psychedelic soul is constantly manifesting in new ways, and while Circuital is closer, certainly, to 2005's Z than Evil Urges, it doesn’t feel like a step backwards, or even like a lateral hop.The record opens with James tooting a half-serious introductory ""horn"" riff that belies a goofy sense of humor. James has always been something of a jokester (cue the whispered ""Shaaa!"" at the end of ""Circuital"" or the line, ""They told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen/ Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison,"" from ""Outta My System""), but his voice is so naturally dramatic that even silly bits can sound like earnest proclamations. That's why-- and this is unique to MMJ-- he often sounds best when he's delivering vague platitudes.Still, anyone who's ever heard James wail in concert is likely to be frustrated by the eternal underuse of his voice in the studio, even when the songs were ostensibly recorded live. There are a few tracks here where producer Tucker Martine captures it in all its intoxicating splendor-- the acoustic lament ""Wonderful (The Way I Feel)"" especially-- but most only hint at what James is capable of delivering in person.  His falsetto (contentious since the days of ""Highly Suspicious"") comes back for ""Holdin on to Black Metal"", a bizarre bit of jam-funk that alternates between pleasantly spirited and genuinely stupid (it's a cautionary tale about not growing out of black metal fandom, and ends with a shout of ""Let's rock!""). On ""Slow Slow Tune"", James sounds remarkably vulnerable, singing to his future progeny over a barely there, bubblegum guitar figure that recalls the Everly Brothers before transitioning into a Flaming Lips-style burnout.Like nearly all of their studio albums, Circuital may not reach the heights of the band's live show-- a good MMJ concert can recalibrate your gut, it can change you-- but it’s a remarkably solid step for a band that's never stopped evolving."
12077	9539	"Fucking working out. How I hate it. How I hate stepping out the door only to come back sweaty, vaguely pissed off, and not much more in shape. It's not that I don't have the gear: running shoes, iPod, neutral tee, the wherewithal to notice girls while praying the finish line was just a little closer. However, even with an array of devices and strategies, everyone knows that working out only works if you, uh, work. In short, there's no easy way out of stretching, running for half an hour, and stretching some more. I've heard it's all about your attitude. I also read somewhere that I should ""just do it,"" but frankly, that always seemed like borderline-sarcastic taunting.
    And now that LCD Soundsystem have sold out to the greatest American shoe company ever to co-opt popular culture, I really have no excuse. Okay, ""sold out"" is harsh, especially considering Nike's advertising and marketing track record: 1987's ""Revolution"" spot by Portland-based ad tycoons Wieden & Kennedy (who'd also worked with Lou Reed for Honda), the ""Bo Knows"" campaign of the late 80s, Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon wondering how MJ put so much height into his jump (""must be the shoes"")-- at this point, they're less stealing from pop culture than contributing to it. And it doesn't hurt that these campaigns were wildly successful, so if James Murphy and company can condescend to the corporate ranks, far be it from me to cry foul.
    Put simply, ""45:33"" (would that John Cage needed to shed those unsightly post-Columbus Day lbs.) is an original workout mix by LCDS. Commissioned by Nike and available at iTunes, the piece is purportedly based on ""an arc designed for running,"" featuring new music by the band, pieced together like a DJ mix in a fashion that's apparently supposed to help me forget I'm hating life on the jogging trail. And somehow, it almost manages to do that. After taking it on a test run, I can attest that the music really does move forward similarly to my own metabolism, gradually building, holding a modest climax in the middle, and ending on a long, fluffy comedown. None of the music really qualifies as ""songs,"" as there isn't much in the way of lyrics or big hooks beyond unobtrusive chants like ""shame on you"" or ""no fun in space""-- though, as I see it, that's a plus for a running mix. There's nothing like being bogged down by music that demands too much attention while you're trying to exercise.

    Things begin slowly with an unassuming analog synth line that gradually speeds up and introduces a hyper-tasteful, jazzy house piano line. A few minutes of building morphs the tune into DFA-flavored soft disco-rock, with Murphy's pronouncements, ""You can't hide... your love away from me! Hey!"" Subtly, the track is peppered with tambourine and a little extra kickdrum, and further morphs into a section I call ""treadmill disco,"" crossing kinetic motorik and what sounds like the mechanical wheeze of exercise machines. When the bells enter with the melody, I start to wonder when this is going to be fleshed out for a new LCDS 12"". That goes double for the following section, wherein Murphy opts for mid-tempo disco-funk (a la the first part of ""Yeah""), eventually adding horns and the ""no fun in space"" refrain.

    Things really take off at about the 28:30 mark with a horn break, and fast, glittery disco-rock that **PAGING DFA PRODUCTIONS** really should be expanded into a single. The cutting bassline and relentless, stone-faced pulse are almost perfectly tailored for the most active part of a workout-- although, even if you wouldn't come within a mile of a jogging trail on a bet, the hi-NRG is tough to deny. In fact, just when you might be ready for extra oxygen and an IV, the bottom falls into the first of two (!) cool-down sections, beginning with the ""shimmering, harmonious tinkerbell cooing"" section, followed by the merely ""harmonious cooing"" part. It's debatable whether or not a mixtape should be 20% comprised of the comedown, but then again, Nike is a big company: Never underestimate the unfit nature of the American consumer. In any case, my trial run ended with me all in one piece, and a lot of this music still in my head. Nice mix.

17729	1024	"Like a masochist in a meatpacking facility, I've just got to have my hooks.
    A song can rock as hard as Keith Moon drumming with dynamite sticks at the
    peak of a coke binge, but without a hook, what are you going to remember?
    ""Yeah, dude, it rocked."" But can you hum it? Can you pick up a guitar and
    clumsily finger the melody in a matter of seconds?  No.  No, you can't.

    Of course, we all need to rock out, too.  Not paper, not scissors-- rock.  I
    mean, hooks are all well and good, but limp pop can only go so far, no matter
    how catchy it is.  What you need is that extra power chord, or maybe that
    unnecessary cymbal crash, to hammer it home.

    I've often had trouble reconciling these conflicting needs. Usually, the best
    I can do is stand in front of my CD player and rapidly alternate between
    hook-filled pop and balls-out rock 'n' roll. That, and listening to Burning
    Airlines' excellent debut album, Mission: Control! Not only did
    Mission: Control! rock as hard as anything J Robbins put out with
    Jawbox, it was crammed with unforgettable pop hooks the likes of which have
    rarely ever graced such a tight rock album.

    And oh, was the result potent. An album that was catchy enough to get stuck
    in your head, and rockin' enough to give you whiplash from the countless hours
    spent mentally replaying the album.  At least, the jaw-dropping first half of
    it was.  Aside from a few weak spots in the later innings, there was little
    fault to be found in Mission: Control!  From a technical or purely
    instinctual point of view, it was a masterfully pulled-off affair.  Sadly,
    such a perfect balance cannot be maintained forever. Ice caps melt, dodos
    become extinct, and rock overpowers the unsuspecting pop hook.  Identikit,
    the Burning Airlines' second full-length, is certainly a fine rock record.
    But with only a few exceptions, it lacks the hooks to really pull you in.

    But to break from tradition, let's look at the exceptions rather than the
    rule. ""A Song with No Words,"" with its twisted, effects-laden guitar riffage,
    lively guitar/bass interplay, and compelling vocal melody, is Burning Airlines
    at their best. While several of the lyrics to ""A Song with No Words"" (yes, it
    has lyrics), could easily be considered typical love song fare, the slithery,
    off-putting guitar part and intricate bassline give the song some deliciously
    shifty undertones. ""Outside the Aviary,"" the album's opener, utilizes a more
    traditional means to achieve a similar result; it's a fiery, intense rock song
    held together by the interplay of three expert musicians.

    Sadly, though, even these songs aren't as instant as the standouts from
    Mission: Control! It seems that when Bill Barbot left the group, so
    did the memorable riffs. New bassist and songwriting collaborator Mike Harbin
    does contribute driving, fluid basslines, and a more dissonant edge, but often,
    the dissonance seems to accomplishing very little.  When it's on the stereo,
    Identikit can be a vicious, intense listen. But unlike its predecessor,
    once the record ends, you're ready to move on."
7204	14869	"Sometimes reissues add a few demos or outtakes, sometimes they add a bonus disc with a live show or additional music, and sometimes they go so far with the bonus material they become something else entirely. The Promise, a name given to two sets based around unheard music from Bruce Springsteen dating to 1977 and 1978, when he was writing and recording the seminal Darkness on the Edge of Town, doesn't fit easily into typical reissue categories. There's a 2xCD, 3xLP set that contains 22 unreleased songs from the period, and then there's a deluxe box set that augments the unreleased material with a remastered version of Darkness and three DVDs. And the latter is housed in a faux spiral-bound notebook with facsimiles of Springsteen's handwritten studio notes from the time. Taken all together, we're talking 10 hours plus of video and audio, along with the booklet. So calling this a reissue of Darkness on the Edge of Town is not accurate. This is a trove, a vast clearinghouse from a fertile period, the product of which turned out to be one terrific album. And in addition to containing its share of treasure, The Promise ultimately confirms that Springsteen is a brilliant editor of his own material.That much is clear when listening to the album itself, which is in danger of being overshadowed by everything released around it. Where the Born to Run box from 2005 looked intently at the album proper (there were few outtakes from those sessions anyway) and portrayed what resulted as a landmark, The Promise focuses on a period of time that produced one memorable album but could have produced others. Much of the material was written when Springsteen was embroiled in a lawsuit with his former manager, and a lot has been made of the impact the legal proceedings were said to have on Springsteen's muse. He made a bleak and bombed-out album, the story goes, because he was feeling lost in the world himself, fearful that he was losing control of his career. And since the lawsuit kept him out of the studio when he wanted so badly to record, he kept piling up songs while he waited for the smoke to clear.Even more than the lawsuit, Darkness seems like Springsteen's instinctive recoil from the Born to Run hype. That's partly why he burned to cut another record-- to ""find out what he's got,"" to quote a line from ""Badlands"" that particularly appealed to him. The Promise documentary included with the box, which combines black-and-white video footage taken in the studio while the album was recorded with recent interviews, makes clear that he wanted to make an ""honest"" record that people would take seriously. He was embarrassed by the hype that had put him on the cover of Time and Newsweek simultaneously in 1975, and he didn't want to be the ""next big thing.""Indeed, it's striking just how different Darkness is from its predecessor in tone and theme. Where Born to Run was about drama, with a sense of bombast that pushed past cinematic and wound up somewhere closer to Broadway, Darkness, despite its share of rockers, is about grim acceptance and pressing on in the face of doubt. In ""Racing in the Street"", the bittersweet ballad that ranks with the best songs Springsteen has ever written, the narrator's girlfriend ""Stares off alone into the night/ With the eyes of one who hates for just being born."" But she's not going anywhere. The darkness that envelops the town keeps the characters in and the rest of the world out. Where the characters in Born to Run were racing against death, the characters here are cursed with the burden of survival. So like all Springsteen records in the early part of his career, there are many songs about cars and driving, but these people seem to be going in circles, idly moving from one place to the next. ""You can ride this road 'til dawn, without another human being in sight,"" goes a line in the richly emotional mid-tempo rocker ""Something in the Night"". With no chance of escape, you have to figure out how to deal with what's in front of you.The stark reality of the songs is reinforced by the album's production. Darkness is in its own way as sonically consistent and coherent as Born to Run; but where that album drew inspiration from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, Darkness tries to do as much as possible with a minimum of embellishment. A few tracks break from this dry and barren template. ""Candy's Room"" and ""Something in the Night"" have the tinkling piano and glockenspiel that might have helped them to fit on Born to Run, while ""Racing in the Street"" has a very particular and hugely effective atmosphere, with just the right touches of reverb and backing vocals to make it sound like an elegy. As for the remastering, I'm not hearing a lot of difference here, but Darkness always sounded good. From the opening drum fill of ""Badlands"" to the grim fade of the title track, there's not a weak song on the album and it deservedly ranks with Springsteen's classics. Which means that it ranks with rock's classic albums, full stop.And it took a long time to get it that way. The music on the 2xCD set The Promise, which was written during the Darkness sessions, shows what Springsteen had to leave behind to get the record that he wanted. That meant no big pop songs. There's ""Because the Night"", given to Patti Smith before being completed, which she then improved and turned into her biggest hit. And then ""Fire"", which Springsteen gave to the Pointer Sisters, and which went to No. 2 on Billboard. It also means no songs about easy times, hope, and escape. So ""Gotta Get That Feeling"", an appealing mid-tempo track with horns and sweet backing vocals and lines like ""We ain't got no money but we don't care"" was shelved. (In Darkness, people have no money but they do care, a lot.) And ""Save My Love"", a catchy piano-led tune, isn't going to make Darkness with lines like ""If we open up our hearts/ Love won't forsake us."" Tell that to the couple in ""Racing in the Street"".The Promise is also a good demonstration of how Springsteen mines his unused songs for material, and shows how many ways he tried to record things before figuring out how they worked best. The set kicks off with ""Racing in the Street ('78)"", a version that begins as an austere ballad but builds into a rock song. It's nowhere near as effective as what came to be on the record, but it is riveting, showing just how elastic Springsteen's melodic and thematic ideas could be. An early version of ""Candy's Room"" is here, too, and it's called ""Candy's Boy""; instead of the original's dark and explosive sensuality, here it's a clean, shuffling guitar-pop tune, charming but without a lot at stake.The tracks on The Promise CD aren't left out just because of subject matter or tone-- they also sound different. As with some songs on Tracks, some of these songs had parts added later. ""Where needed, I worked on them to bring them to fruition,"" Springsteen writes in the notes. ""Many stand as they were recorded all those years ago."" The re-touching is at its most extreme on ""Save My Love"", which was written in the 70s but cut in 2010. In other places, the vocals and music sound fundamentally different from the recordings of the era. Certainly, the arrangements are thicker than what wound up on Darkness, which makes sense since some of the songs left behind were R&B-based bar-band songs and swooning songs of love and lust. Still, despite the lack of consistency, the 22 new songs (there are 21 tracks, but ""The Way"" is a hidden bonus track at the end) are mostly very good and occasionally great. None feel like they should have been on Darkness, but almost all of them hold up to repeat plays and stand on their own as very good Springsteen-- easily on the level of mid-level stuff on The River, say.On the visual side, one DVD has a bizarre recording of Springsteen and the E Street Band playing Darkness on the Edge of Town straight through in an empty theater in Asbury Park in December 2009. I suspect that this decision was inspired in part by the notion that the album is about loneliness and open spaces, but there's something off about seeing this band, known so well for its deep connection to its audience, playing by themselves in a large room without people.More interesting on the same disc are the live odds-and-ends from rehearsals at Springsteen's rented Jersey home in the 70s. The band is packed into what looks like a small bedroom, Springsteen is shirtless, with the familiar guitar around his neck, standing before a microphone taped to a stand. And the band is running through a couple new songs in an intimate space with no sense at all of posterity. (They are so casual, Steve Van Zant isn't even wearing a hat!) Also on this disc are songs from a 1978 show in Phoenix, including the famous clip for ""Rosalita"" that got some play in the early days of MTV.  These Phoenix performances are generally superior to the three-hour set from a 1978 show in Houston included on a separate DVD. The video comes from the arena's video feed and, given the quality of video in 1978, quality could be better. But it is a multi-camera shoot with good coverage and Springsteen and the E Street band were in amazing form throughout that year. So no complaints about more live Springsteen.Which leaves the documentary, which in one sense serves as the centerpiece of the project. As with the film included with the Born to Run box, there are interesting details about the technical aspects of the album. Chuck Plotkin's theory behind his approach to mixing vocals is fascinating, and explains why this album feels so balanced. We see fragments of songs, lots of exhaustion and sitting around, and get a look at how Springsteen works as a bandleader. There's a moment in the first scene where he looks tired and frustrated and a little pissed off and you realize that it would be scary to have him mad at you. He's not always an easy guy to work for. It's refreshing to see such a simple display of humanity when the documentary obviously has very specific points that it wants to hit.Still, there's something odd about these ""making of"" documentaries about albums coming from the artist themselves. In part because they seem so intent on directing how the music is heard. Sets like this and Neil Young's Archives reflect a desire for artists to take control of their legacy and shape the narrative of their careers. It's easy to understand this impulse, and doubly so when you are talking about people as controlling as Springsteen or Neil Young. And yet it's also futile. As listeners, our stories are what will ultimately matter, and by having the music in our lives, we give it significance and form. Darkness is the kind of record you sink into, an album of power and dignity and loss and just a hint at the possibility of transcendence, which is something Springsteen's fans have known all along, even without hearing a single detail of how it is made. We'll take it all and have loads of fun exploring all the ephemera, but Springsteen carved through all this-- the pile of songs, the legal bullshit, the media image he wasn't comfortable with-- to make that one magical record, which is the most impressive part of it all."

    Few things are more dangerous to good pop than a perfectly talented artist who thinks his music isn't smart enough. It's the sort of attitude that combines the most perilous ideas a musician can have-- the urge to ignore or downplay the strengths of his past work; an underestimation of what that supposedly inadequate music actually means to fans; a presumptuous, elitist idea of what ""advancement"" involves-- and then pins an uncomfortable impetus on the longtime listener: If you're not ready to grow and expand with this new style, maybe you'd be better off bobbing your heads to that old slapdash bullshit with the rest of the safety-craving bandwagoneers.
    There was an understandably furious internet reaction to a quote from a mid-2004 allhiphop.com interview with Rjd2, where the then-in-demand indie rap producer claimed that he considered much of his hip-hop production to be ""moron music."" It was a tossed-off dismissal that implicated everything from his well-aging 2002 debut Deadringer (which boasted ""The Horror"", without question one of the most amped-up hell-yeah hip-hop instrumentals of the decade) to his rock-solid work with Soul Position to the sharp Pete Rock-caliber ""Saliva"", the best beat on Viktor Vaughn (MF Doom)'s Vaudeville Villain. And while his attempts to straighten up the quote's context were fervent-- helpfully clarifying that he didn't think all hip-hop production was dumb, he just felt mentally stunted making his own sometimes-- it's still difficult to avoid feeling as though you've been played like a sucker for investing a lot more time and interest into that music than its creator apparently did.
    It all seemed to come to a head near the release of Since We Last Spoke, released around the time of that infamous interview: As an expansion of Rjd2's post-Shadow blueprint, it was a successful effort at making a mostly-instrumental, retro-minded but current-sounding funk/rock album using hip-hop production techniques. But successive interviews and articles revealed that it also caused enough engineering headaches to lead Rj to believe that sample-hunting was a dead end, that ProTools was the enemy, and that he was really just meant to be a pop songwriter like Elliott Smith or Britt Daniel.
The Third Hand is Rjd2's Big Important Musical Statement, meant to announce his transformation from lumpenprole beat flogger to true pop (read: rock) artist: Aside from the drums, everything on the album originates from a Real Live Instrument played by Rj, which he then pieces together and warps into shape like some sort of Todd Rundgren homunculus. It sadly turns out to be an unsettling piece of evidence that he's lost without someone else's pre-existing sounds to extrapolate from and transform. He still draws from other artists' ideas-- The Third Hand is rife with flashes of indie pop touchstones like Stereolab, Syd Barrett-era Floyd, and the Zombies-- but the album resembles an overambitious Money Mark record, bloated keyboards crowding his grooves until they sound cramped and irritable. Between the quivering harps, weepy mellotrons, and delicate, pixie-dust electronics that litter the album, Rj must think  all you need to do to transmogrify into a pop genius is to imagine what the soundtrack to a Zach Braff remake of Wild Style would sound like.
    What still remains of his hip-hop backbone-- the powerful, charging drum breaks that were his stock in trade dating back to his Mhz days-- feels grossly out of place. The beats feel bullish and overbearing amidst all the lightness, giving turbocharged propulsion to songs that feel like they're better off ambling, and forcing uprock rhythms to rudely stuff paisley ascots into their Adidas track tops. ""Rules for Normal Living"" is a particularly weird attempt at a dance track, sticking the album's only semblance of an electro-style beat in the middle of the track-- almost as a punchline-- and bookending it with a wheezing plod that sounds like the fat, arthritic version of Kraftwerk's ""Tour de France"". ""Sweet Piece"" is even more baffling: The Gap Band's ""You Dropped a Bomb on Me"" funklessly gussied up, a neutered caricature of a groove that loses all its promise once you figure out that its idea of a melodic instrumental hook is a noodle-armed shrug of a synth riff that evaporates almost immediately. ""Just When"" ganks the opening beat to ""Billie Jean"" (or an incredible simulation of it) and turns its sleek, minimalist 4/4 into a cluttered, halting traffic jam.

    Much of the disappointment of The Third Hand is that of expectation, and elements that initially register as nauseating treacle can sometimes sneak up on you. The two best instrumental tracks on the record, ""Get It"" and ""The Bad Penny"", lack the bravado and heaviness of his earlier work but still feel alive and well-crafted, even as they strain for a baroque psychedelia they can't quite reach. But another reason they stand out is that Rj doesn't sing on them. Prior to this record, Since We Last Spoke's closing track, ""Through the Walls"", was his only other significant attempt at writing pop lyrics, and with his flat, non-committal voice hesitantly muttering words that sounded like power-pop fridge magnet poetry, it practically demanded that someone with a bit more presence take over on lead vocal. (Fortunately, someone hollered for Ric Ocasek to do the remix.) The other vocal number on that record-- the wispy, syrupy Labi Siffre cover ""Making Days Longer""-- is the unfortunate precedent for Rj's turn toward vocal melody, and the same halfhearted falsetto runs rampant over The Third Hand.

    Typically overdubbed into semi-coherent oblivion and grinding gears between deadpan and over-dramatic, his voice is a grating mess, creaking out non-sequitur high notes and juggling both fake-Brit (Bille Joe Armstrong sounds like Ray Davies in comparison) and fake-soul (ibid. Jamie Lidell and Teddy Pendergrass) affectations. Not that any voice could save the lyrics: Between the poorly-scanning turns of phrase (""She can get plump off of beer and meatloaf,"" from ""You Never Had It So Good""), the pointless similes (""Little princess/ With her little ways gone bad/ You should ask her/ About the dates she had/ Mr. Legend, Dr. Civic and Mr. Lexus,"" from ""Sweet Piece"") and the out-of-touch stabs at populist subject matter (""Have Mercy"" makes working a job downtown sound as harrowing as the woes in a Lightnin' Hopkins song), Pharrell can rest easy knowing that ""Her ass is a spaceship/ I want to ride"" has plummeted in ""rap producer-turned-singer writes something laughable"" standings.
    Unfortunately, The Third Hand is aptly-titled: It feels like a step below second-hand. Would it have felt any less ridiculous if it were an out-of-nowhere debut from someone we'd never heard of instead of an attempted breakthrough by one of underground hip-hop's best producers? Marginally, if that. And maybe if Rj works out the flaws and figures out his limitations, chances are he'll do what a few other writers have predicted and produce a pretty good Gorillaz record in a few years. But after reading him say that he's more interested in making records people would want to sample than sampling other peoples' records, one can only hope he's right and that some future producer can salvage something from this debacle.

5946	16151	"Last month, 2011's breakout indie rapper Danny Brown sat down with Impose magazine after being named their rapper of the year. When asked who his favorite rap act of 2011 had been, he named Bay Area duo Main Attrakionz, whose prolific output and undaunted adoption of the burgeoning ""cloud rap"" sub-genre has earned them a growing profile and a diverse collection of fans. ""They talking street shit,"" Brown explained of Squadda B and MondreM.A.N., ""but they talking it over those trippy-ass, cloudy-ass beats."" The co-sign still felt a little surprising: On one hand, anyone who has heard 808s & Dark Grapes II, the group's most notable release to date, knows how easily pleasing their half-baked creations can be. But on the other, for a guy like Brown-- whose wildman persona is often one of his great draws on record-- putting on for two guys who are often criticized for both not having a ton of personality, and sometimes being unable to think outside of their own little box, seemed somewhat incongruent.Take for instance last year's I Smoke Because I Don't Care About Death, the excellently titled but not totally memorable solo mixtape from Squadda B, which featured a smattering of awfully cloudy tracks that found a guy sounding so comfortable in his own lane, it seemed as if he'd never get over. Which is why Back $ellin' Crack, which squeaked in right before 2011's final bell rang, may provide some clues as to why we might be seeing more straightforward music coming from the Main Attrakionz camp in the new year. Just looking at that borderline-NSFW album cover above, it's clear that Back $ellin' Crack is not strictly another cloud-rap affair. Instead, Squadda has crafted a mixtape's mixtape, with strong, varied production styles that could complement any assortment of rappers. And while unsurprisingly lacking in content-rich lyricism, this center-of-left approach proves to be a step in the right direction, with Squadda's oddball tendencies and workmanlike demeanor still intact.There is a lot of personality to be found on Back $ellin' Crack, but it's helpful that, working outside of his normal routine, Squadda never appears to feel the need to play keep-up or bend to the will of a beat. ""Down"", which features barn-burning verses from MA affiliate Shady Blaze and Danny Brown himself, is probably most indicative of Squadda's focus here. Some rappers would feel hard-pressed to set off the double-time fireworks just to remain visible, but his ability to play the background and let others shine where applicable (one of the benefits of normally having to share the spotlight with another MC) is a real asset. Which isn't to say that he's using the rest of his time here most wisely: ""Rapgame"", which boasts some Supreme Clientele-grade silkiness, finds Squadda both reflective and funny (""Wonder if they think I'm lyin' about the shit I spit/ Can I at least get a chance to start lyin' about shit?""), while ""Van Halen"" opens with some weirdly appealing, atonal singsong rap. But most fun of all might be ""The Greenova Way"", with its Looney Tuned-up beat (courtesy of Squadda himself) allowing him to playfully jab at the pigeonholers: ""They call it cloud rap/ Wanna see me? Then look up!""But not all of Back $ellin' Crack is nearly as effective. The second half of the tape, which heavily features MondreM.A.N., feels too safe compared to the material that preceded it. None of it really has anything to do with Mondre's presence, nor the way Squadda and he sound on these tracks together-- in fact, stuff like ""Conversations Pt. II"" makes for a solid entry in the Main Attrakionz catalog. But in context, it's a step backward, especially considering how much effort Squadda has put into taking the duo's established sound and repurposing it for audiences more drawn to conventional approaches. By the time ""Cream Soda"" shows up-- which unfortunately finds Squadda rapping over Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" (what Frank Ocean hath wrought!)-- there's a distinct sense that Back $ellin' Crack's ambition has dried up.Stick around though, because there's still the two-part, seven-and-a-half-minute opus ""Hail Squadda"" to feast on. Combining the warped, crystalline lean-back synths of producer Marlee B's opening portion (complete with a creeped-out repurposing of the ""Hail Mary"" chorus) with Status Star's thunderous finale, Danny Brown's prediciton becomes even clearer: ""You could totally put that shit over a Lex Lugar beat and it'd be a fucking street song."" It's some seriously tough stuff, and even further proof that when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."
17384	1543	"Those choke-hazard tchotchkes Animals on Wheels no longer fascinate Andrew
    Coleman. Drill-n-bass has lost its appeal, too, over the years. Thus, Coleman has
    abandoned his former alias and style and is all the better for the switch. As
    Animals on Wheels, Coleman gave the world two albums of breakbeat encrusted noise,
    and as such, sat on the fringes of the Ninja Tune roster. Now recording for
    Thrill Jockey, Coleman finds himself comfortable, his avant-leaning precocity
    embraced by the label that also writes royalty checks for Mouse on Mars, Nobukazu
    Takemura, and Oval.

    Though trading in the frenetic energy of his Animals on Wheels' releases, Coleman
    is still pursuing juxtapositions.  Whereas Animals on Wheels' Designs and
    Mistakes, and its less frantic successor, Nuvol I Cadira, sought to
    contrast wounding shards of breakbeats with warm fuzzy melodies, Everything
    Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt looks for clashes between elegance and
    distortion.  These distortions, created with antiquated 16-bit equipment and
    soundcards, imbue Coleman's gorgeous melodies with an aliased corona that works
    in harmony with the very appropriate title that Coleman has chosen for this
    collection.

    Emerging from low frequency waves, ""Too Early By Far"" pits white noise against a
    harmonium drone and a piano melody. Despite the white noise gathering supporters
    from the clapped-out percussion synth Coleman uses, the exuberant piano melody
    excels and is greeted at the end by a honking bass clarinet. ""Pi Four"" finds
    Coleman's piano trading lines with a frazzled, piercing, possibly
    guitar-in-origin figure, while a Boards of Canada-style rhythm ensures that all
    punches are above the belt. The crazy calliope of ""Escalator Apartment"" wrestles
    with a Nuvol I Cadira-ish breakbeat clatter.

    The Bucephalus Bouncing Ball
    melody and cracked percussion of ""Plot Lost Sixteen"" take me back to agitated
    Sunday afternoons, apparently lazy, but in fact fraught with nascent nastiness.
    ""Vocational Shouter"" recalls Aphex Twin's fuzzy masterpiece, ""Tha,"" with its
    anchorless, sinewy chords grasping for just a moment's coherence. ""Hang Up
    Season"" carries on the approximation of sense begun with ""Vocational Shouter.""
    About the exerting synthline, shrill lines force their way in and out of the
    background like the angels of death from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

    During ""Wider Ignorance,"" Coleman subverts a routine downtempo drum pattern by
    sideswiping it with electronic piano chords and a melody borrowed from Salvador
    Dali's mother's musical jewelry box. Closing the album with the spacious-but-weighty
    ""Curse of Knowing"" Coleman proves one final time that he's as fascinating a
    pianist as he is a drum machine operator. With Everything Was Beautiful and
    Nothing Hurt, Andrew Coleman has accomplished the fusion of avant-garde
    electronics and poetic pianism. Coleman serenely succeeds where Richard D.
    James' Drukqs faltered: Coleman wasn't faking when he came up with his
    album title."
2213	20278	"Oren Ambarchi is usually described as a guitarist but before 1998's Stacte, his solo debut, he was a drummer. And if early records like Suspension or Reconnaissance, with Martin Ng, tended to fixate on liquid oscillations and eyedropper drones, recent releases are putting his rhythmic sensibility front and center. Ambarchi's 2012 album Sagittarian Domain was propelled by an elliptical funk groove that moved between krautrock and post-punk. ""Knots"", from 2012's Audience of One, is largely a showcase for a scorching ride-cymbal fugue played by Joe Talia, and the recently released Live Knots, featuring Tokyo and Krakow performances of the piece, is even more intensely percussive, with Talia's drumming fighting to bring order to Ambarchi's torrential feedback. And now Behold, Ambarchi's new collaboration with Jim O'Rourke, picks up the rhythmic thread of the Australian musician's recent work and finds him back behind the drums.At first, Behold sounds like a continuation of the ideas that Ambarchi and O'Rourke set out on Indeed, their 2011 debut LP as a duo. Like its predecessor, Behold is a single piece of music separated into two side-long sections. Within its 42-minute expanse, it combines multiple methods and approaches—real-time jams, electro-acoustic collage, synthesizers and guitar feedback, ambient dub and free improv—into a shape that's at once sprawling and streamlined.It's really anyone's guess who is doing what. At the core of the music, there's a battle between brushed metal and scratchy percussive sounds, on the one hand, and luminous tonal elements on the other. The music is aglow with streaks of feedback, molten oscillators, rubbed wineglass rims, and even the occasional struck or held note. With music this abstracted, this gradual, small gestures count for a lot, so that a single pair of bass notes, played several measures apart, come to seem like a major theme. And while there are no melodies, per se, the way filament-like phrases flare up in the murk is nevertheless lyrical. Somewhere in the mix, there's what sounds like an organ, and that Hammond-like flutter imbues the album with lively, trembling movements, even when the music is comparatively still. There are drones like the buzz of airplanes high overhead and a forest's canopy worth of synthetic birdcalls. Beneath the crystal-faceted edges of the sound, the blur runs deep and dense.What most separates Behold from Indeed is the new album's strong sense of groove, with Ambarchi carving deep patterns with ride cymbals and hi-hats and ultra-low, chest-caving kick drums. It feels like motorik distilled to its very essence, an IV drip of pure rhythm. Like everything else on the album, the drums come and go. For most of ""Behold A"", there's nothing more than a hint of cymbal tapped out in rolling, quarter-note pulses; for long stretches, there's not even that. Like an underground stream returning to the surface, the rippling metal pulse returns midway through ""Behold B"" and gradually gathers strength, rising in concert with squalls of guitar feedback and contrapuntal piano. After a long, slow climb, it's a quick climax; the beat dies, and the remaining sounds go sailing out into the abyss, like water over a cliff. But it's the rhythm that stays with you, long after silence has settled in. Behold is the kind of music where, depending upon the angle from which you approach it, you may perceive its overall effects in radically different ways. The music evolves so gradually, it's easy to find yourself wondering how you've wound up at a given point; there's a sense of traveling without moving, of zooming in and out between broad strokes and pinpoint details, toggling between distracted reverie and close attention."
9161	12830	"One of my favorite singles  last year was Fred Falke's remix of the Whitest Boy Alive's ""Golden  Cage"", a glossy, euphoric piece of electro-pop that mutated a gentle,  unassuming disco comedown into a late-decade bookend to Daft Punk's  ""Digital Love"". Yet despite the way Falke's remix brought out the best qualities  of his syrupy, lonesome voice, Whitest Boy (and Kings of Convenience) head Erlend Øye is most comfortable when  he's a bit subdued and quiet. And as much as massive house beats complement  his vocals, he seems most at home when his musical surroundings undergo  the same state of half-withdrawn restraint that he's in. Even in shifting  from Kings of Convenience's acoustic pastoralism to the plugged-in,  dance-friendly pop of the Whitest Boy Alive, Øye seemed like he was  aiming not for bars or nightclubs, but the headphones of people walking  down empty streets.The abandoned-dancefloor atmosphere  of 2006's Dreams made TWBA a surprising side-project debut, but  sophomore album Rules expands the mood just a little-- and, in the process, the sound gets  a little more crowded. Where its predecessor let the rhythm breathe  and gave most of the attention to Øye's sleepy murmur and his loudly  echoing, desolate-sounding guitar, Rules pushes the beats just a bit more forward and has Øye's riffs sharing  a tighter space with Daniel Nentwig's expanded, more prominent palette  of synths and keyboards. It doesn't improve things any: With that  much more emphasis placed on the backbeat and away from that bell-like  guitar sound that made the original ""Golden Cage"" (or ""Figures""  or ""Borders"" from the debut) so haunting, the relatively upbeat moments sound a  bit more like the brusque, arch Krautfunk of recent Fujiya & Miyagi.  And while it seems like it'd be a good trade-off to have a version  of Lightbulbs with a warmer-sounding vocalist and some actual  human emotion, emphasizing the groove only reveals that bassist Marcin  Oz and drummer Sebastian Maschat seem strangely hesitant about going  full disco.As catchy as much of  Rules is, that hesitancy brings about an imbalance  of mood; tracks like ""Keep a Secret"", ""Courage"", and ""1517"" (the latter of which sounds oddly like a cocktail-funk tweak of Daft  Punk's ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"") ride on grooves that  feel like they should be livelier than the subtly muffled bass and drumbeats  that propel them, leaving the guitar to pick up the rhythmic slack.  The songs frequently fall into an odd, twitchy no-man's land between  unhurried minimalism and actual funk that the previous album was too  relaxed to stumble into, though TWBA do pull themselves together enough  for the more motorik ""Dead End"" and the slow-build faux-house crescendo  of ""Island"" to step lively for real. It's more of a problem if  you're expecting a straight-up dance album than an unassuming indie pop  album, and if all you need's a warm pulse and a taut rhythm section-- and that chiming guitar, which still rings out often  enough-- those moments are more than adequate. The points where  Rules gets a little too mellow are where it goes from the vaguely  compelling to the preciously cloying, i.e., the tropical torpor of ""Intentions""  and the Ambien-fueled headswim of ""Rollercoaster Ride"", which does  less to evoke its lyrical conceit than it does a leisurely paddle-boat  excursion.At least Øye still plays to  his strengths. To be honest, a more vigorous backbeat might undermine  much of the sentiment in Rules with his plaintive presence still running things, especially since whatever  loneliness that was lost with the busier production has been compensated  for lyrically. Sure, the subject matter's familiar-- infidelity  between friends in ""Gravity"", the feeling of uncommunicative isolation  in ""Island"", the difficulty of committing (""Courage"") and of  ending that commitment (""Dead End""), but Øye sings them with  a distinctly sugary melancholy that can't be mistaken for anyone else's  voice. All that worn-down, flagging energy behind it is something that  can at least be endured-- though at least the potential remixes could  be interesting."
15825	8509	"Fronted by darkly-styled, ex-Subtonix singer-bassist-saxophonist Jesse Eva (aka photographer Jesse Trashed), San Francisco's The Vanishing is a
    guitar-less trio whose blend of Goth-inflected horror-film synthesizers, new-wave rat-a-tat drumming, murkily driving bass, and Mike Kelley-esque
    Children of the Night imagery wades rather predictably within the pools of dark-edged 80s dance music. The three raven-haired demigods have the
    Look and the Sound, but their obsessive conceptual pose-- based on stale leftovers of the Sisters of Mercy's semi-apocalyptic trope= - falters
    whenever someone opens their mouth to shout about ""scary"" stuff. On their first full-length Songs For Psychotic Children, Eva's mostly nonsensical
    tales of the macabre are redundant and overwrought, her vocal tracks approaching darkness with the subtlety of a full-body ""Bela Lugosi's Dead""
    tattoo.  Stylistically, her densely trebled vocals initially bring to mind the beloved warble of early-period Siouxsie, but instead of mixing
    restraint with the full-throttle howl, she chants through the album's five vocal tracks with relatively unchanged cadences.
    Despite the overtly gothic ministrations, Songs For Psychotic Children strikes like a treatise on memory and trauma via allegories of girls with
    barbed wire teeth, Dorian Gray mirrors, and that old Victorian standard: ballrooms of rotting fruit. Damn! Toned down a bit, these sentiments
    would be less cartoonish and all the more frightening; I prefer the moments between vocals, the portions less tightly connected to a
    psycho-ward cliché.
    On ""White Walls"" there's much obnoxiously vehement screaming about the lost traces of history buried within whitewashing, but
    ironically, the ten seconds of fascistic white noise at the end of the track are its most interesting moment, finally burying all that whining in a grave
    of foreboding feedback. ""Lost in Pictures"" continues the focus on forgotten shadows and the spaces that memories haunt: \x93Children scream through
    cellophane, a thin layer of hell/ They suffocate trapped in the last position they fell/ 'We live in the shadows on the floor where we will fall
    / No one will ever hear our voice because we are so small.'""  So, basically, my grandfather's hard candies come wrapped in a 'thin layer of hell'? That's
    fucked up.
    The instrumentals make more sense, or at least hold together better. For listeners who've grown up with a television and access to Stephen King
    books, the language of horror is firmly ingrained in our psyches and well-enough understood, even on the most corporeal, non-thinking level; we don't need
    a cheat sheet.  On the band's first instrumental (which is untitled), a synthesizer approximates pulsating wind from outside a window while another sprays atmospherics,
    humming with horror film obviousness. This track aims to evoke a particular setting; for example, an old dark house on a cold rainy night? ""Sighs on
    Pyres"" is reminiscent of a slow-as-molasses ""You Belong To The City"", but as a Gothic reinvention with choirs of Casio keyboards pre-set to the ""spooky""
    sounds. The fast-paced ""Obituary""-- the album's strongest track-- is a Vampiric dance party bringing to mind both OMD and Psychic TV.  The final piece on
    the album (also an untitled instrumental) swivels upon the same windy, sawing synthesizer as the opener, but sounds more spacious, interiority replaced
    with a sense of notes resting in the air, ungrounded, ready to fly o'er the horizon, the silent ghosts that come to terrorize you softly each night.
    One of the more interesting aspects of the less-extreme forms of ""evil"" music and the culture that follows are the slippages between the humdrum
    surroundings of daily existence and the escape into temporary transcendence, to clove-and-absinthe-scented dance clubs. When too many dark
    buttons are pushed, self-parody becomes a difficult thing to avoid: it's so much harder to fear something that makes you laugh, unless you're laughing
    nervously. All in all, for this sort of over-determined, laughable evil, I'd rather listen to Cradle of Filth; though their approach is equally schlock-y,
    they actually make me nervous."
1765	20756	"For listeners who discovered Seven Davis Jr. via his joyous 2013 single ""One"", the release of his debut album is cause for celebration. It marks the culmination of a two-year period in which we've had only teasing glimpses—an EP here, a Prince cover there—at his unorthodox take on house and funk. But for the Houston-born, Los Angeles-based musician, Universes marks the completion of a much longer process and a vindication of his methods, as well as a rebuke against those who doubted him along the way.Davis' moment has been a long time coming. He grew up in a gospel family and got his first look inside the music industry early on. He discovered house and techno while living, and dancing, in San Francisco; for a while, he ghost-produced for rappers, but his own productions, he has said, were deemed too strange. ""I made a lot of this music many years ago and other labels and artists hated on me for it,"" he recalled around the release of The Lost Tapes Vol. 1, a compendium of his early work. ""They said it was too weird, too different, sounded like drug music.""In fact, it was drug music, but at some point, he kicked his habits, and in that sense, it's possible to read Universes as a testament to the soul-cleansing power of funk. Once upon a time, negativity established the limits of his vision: ""I Don't Give a Fuck"", the opening song on The Lost Tapes Vol. 1, complained, ""You need to go find a hobby"" and ""Stop being a hater""—understandable sentiments, perhaps, but the prosaic lyrics didn't measure up to his production talents or his powerful voice. But the far more assured Universes is swept up in the power of positive thinking, both lyrically and musically. The gorgeous, introductory ""Imagination"", a dreamy nod to the sound of D'Angelo's Voodoo, gives way to ""Freedom"", an uptempo riot of stuttering drums and disco vamps that can barely contain its giddy cheer. In ""Sunday Morning"", he pares down the production and puts his voice center stage: ""Bet you never had a love like this before,"" he sings in a loop, and it's not just the lyrics that do the talking; it's his playful voice, swooping and diving, the very embodiment of joy at its most seductive.""Everybody Too Cool"", a sly romp splashed with organ and falsetto, is even more joyful, as Davis taunts, ""Mr. DJ/ Don't play this in the club/ 'Cause people don't dance no more/ Everybody too cool for school""—a clever bit of reverse psychology, because good luck standing still in the face of his loping, rolling groove. Davis' own history as a house dancer is evident in his music's wild gyrations; even when he's laying down four-to-the-floor rhythms, he imbues them with more bump and flex than most contemporary dancefloors will be used to. Case in point: ""Good Vibes"", a co-production with Julio Bashmore that loops its squelchy chords and rickety drum machine, as though 1993's Daft Punk were trying to worm their way back to Minneapolis, 1985.But there's a somber side to the album, too. In ""Fighters"", the album's emotional centerpiece, he layers his voice into a mournful, wordless mass, over which he offers a lament for America's racist violence. He keeps the details vague, but that winds up contributing to the song's depiction of fruitless violence and misspent energies, all of it summed up in the line, ""Everybody's hoping for peace but they're doing it all wrong."" It's the album's most musically adventurous song, too, skulking along in a strange, 5/4 time signature, the murk mirroring the exhaustion of the lyrics.The album perks up after that; ""Afterlife"", a wheezy keyboard sketch, finds Davis brushing the dirt off his shoulder: ""I will love, I will love, I will love/ Let 'em hate, let 'em hate, let 'em hate."" And ""No Worries"", one of the album's sprightliest jams, is a kiss-off of the most carefree kind. Throughout it all, his arrangements burst with a vitality that belies their modest construction. The sounds may be humble, not that much more hi-fi than his early demos, but their vision of funk as lifeblood is never anything less than radiant."

     If you're reading this, you probably already know the bullet points regarding this particular beat combo-- they're from Nashville, they're teenagers, one of them dropped out of high school, their parents are music industry vets, the UK loves them to death, various pop-culture publications have been on their nubile jock since Insert Live Performance Here, and Thurston Moore thinks they're the bees' knees. Some other fun facts: Their full-length debut hits American shores today, on that once-in-a-century date 6/6/06, frontwoman Jemina Pearl's actual last name is Abegg (wise stage name choice, for damn sure), and they rock. No, what BYOP does isn't exactly the most original thing in the world-- watch out for rampant Yeah Yeah Yeahs comparison-- but they do it with a flair and panache and enthusiasm that belies their youth.
      Don't expect any ""Maps""-like moments on this record, though. The  closest BYOP comes to showing a softer side is via a veiled  threat-- ""No, we're not out of ammo yet."" Be Your Own Pet piss on  everything in sight, and it's hard to not want to drop trou and join in  on the fun. From the first moment of ""Thresher's Flail"" (a fitting  title for this album's opener), the group's firing on all cylinders,  speeding through 15 tracks in just over a half-hour. It's no  surprise Bad Brains receives a shout-out-- Jonas Stein plays guitar  hero, spitting out power chords every which way, while Nathan Vasquez and Jamin Orrall set a  blistering pace and keep things moving quickly. The band's on point  throughout, especially on ""Bunk Trunk Skunk"" as Pearl gleefully shouts, ""I'm an independent  motherfucker!"" and threatens to make off with everyone's cherry.
      As much as I'd like to spread the praise equally among all four Pets,  it's hard not to focus on Pearl. Her wanton charisma-- equal parts PJ Harvey, Kathleen Hanna, and, yes,  Karen O-- is a thing to behold live, but it's definitely not lacking on  record. Granted, it would take a corpse to screw up lines as meaty as,  ""I'm wicked rad, and I'm here to steal away your virginity,"" or the Iggy  Pop-esque request, ""my brain is on fire, so piss right in my ear!"" For  most of the record, Pearl's set to search and destroy, whether she's  yelling about zombies going out for a midnight snack, making bike-riding  sound like the coolest shit to ever hit pavement (""we're on two wheels,  baby!""), or going off her meds and drowning her boyfriend. She can  also take it down a notch, as on ""Adventure"" where she  slides in some charming asides (""okay, so yeah, it's cool,  cause we're, like, adventurers"") amidst her wilderness reportage.

      Even at its most ominous, though, the album never loses its verve or  vitality. It's just one quick hit after another, a succession of aural  whippets that last long after the record's over. An album chock full of  back-to-back barnburners might seem an exhausting listen, but  BYOP bucks that trend with ease. And they just got the right to  vote. Hell, if I were as good as these guys, I'd drop out of high  school, too.

6408	15675	"While Michaela Dippel, aka Ada, isn't quite a household name in the electronic music world, she has two very solid albums under her belt: 2004's beat workout Blondie and 2009's LP-length Kompkat mix Adaptations. The latter was especially appealing for its balance of ambient techno and pop, and it brought together disparate artists like Tracey Thorn and DJ Koze in a way that felt natural and fun. You could recommend it to somebody without much interest in minimal techno and be pretty confident they'd dig it. So it's reasonable to anticipate good things from Ada's latest, Meine Zarten Pfoten, but the album defies expectations to the point that it's actually kind of puzzling.Rather than embrace her techno past or more fully flesh out Adaptation's mixed-genre approach, what Ada does here is go almost completely soft pop. Like, ""Girl From Ipanema"" soft pop. Now, I think there's a kernel of a good idea here, maybe something building out from Saint Etienne's elegant travelogue music, but what we get feels tamer than that. Songs like opener ""Faith"" are so airy and peaceful that they seem flat, and there's generally a weird avoidance of beats. It's hard to imagine ""Likely""-- composed mainly of acoustic guitar strumming and chintzy organ-- being worse off with some force behind it.If that sounds harsh, it's because I think Ada is capable of stronger material, and she shows that during the record's second half. Here, the pillowy folk vibe that occurs throughout much of Meine Zarten Pfoten (which tellingly translates to ""my tender paws"") breaks up some to reveal tracks that are more dynamic and tightly constructed. You've got stuff like ""At the Gate"", patient deep house that builds to a hypnotic climax, and ""Intro"" (strangely not the first song), which is rich ambient techno that showcases Ada's gifts for texture and slow burn. The thing about these highlights, though, is that they're quite separate from the rest of the LP-- different enough in tone and style that they almost don't fit. Together with the ultra-mellow atmosphere, this lack of cohesion makes the album feel messy, and maybe worse, a little boring."
64	22683	The cover art for Relationships features a photo of an entryway, nearly every inch of its canary yellow walls covered in signatures, writing and drawings. The photo was taken inside of Nick Hook’s studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where the producer has recorded and worked with a laundry list of hip-hop and electronic artists over the years, including Run the Jewels, Young Thug, and Action Bronson. Relationships, his debut album, feels a lot like that studio must: a place where Hook endlessly tinkers as a constant stream of guests passes through, each leaving behind bits of their sound. In keeping with Hook’s penchant for collaboration, Relationships enlists an impressive roster of artists: the freshly Drake-co-signed 21 Savage, the Deftones’ Chino Moreno, electro wunderkind Hudson Mohawke and even the late DJ Rashad. To hear him tell it, Hook didn’t pay for any of these features, relying instead on the goodwill accrued through years of production and engineering work.Given the diverse company he keeps, it should come as no surprise that Hook’s debut is an eclectic listen. That said, Relationships manages to hang together surprisingly well, anchored in large part by Hook’s rhythmic and melodic sensibilities. Hook is a collector of vintage studio equipment and it shows: The sounds of analog synths suffuse these songs with warmth, while much of the drum programming has a tactile, human feel. Also old-fashioned is the manner in which Relationships was constructed: all of these collaborations were recorded in person at Hook’s studio, rather than cobbled together from emailed files.Clearly, Hook is a big believer in chemistry, and this collaborative spirit tends to bring out his best. Over the course of Relationships, Hook allows his guests to pull his sound in a number of different directions, ultimately showcasing his own versatility. “Gucci’s” pitches up emerging Atlanta rapper 24hrs’ vocals into cartoon-character territory, the end result sounding like a trap banger crossbred with early Kanye’s chipmunk soul. “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” a bleak grime number featuring 19-year old London rapper Novelist, colorfully evokes London’s wet streets: Hook’s synths alternately patter like raindrops and howl like sirens as Novelist raps with hungry-upstart fury. “Another Way” arrives at funky body music by way of cosmic synths, while “All Alone” matches Makonnen’s late night tomcat croon with the proper shade of noir. Given 21 Savage’s involvement and its title, you can probably guess what “Head” is about; more surprising is how exuberant the song feels—bass drum hits that pop like confetti-filled balloons, skittering hi-hats, glimmering synth lines. It’s a genuinely fun song, one where Savage sounds delightfully out-of-place, like a dead-eyed hustler at a child’s birthday party.Relationships is bookended by two collaborations with the footwork pioneer DJ Rashad, culled from sessions Hook recorded with Rashad before his untimely death. Opening track “+ 3,” which also features DJ Paypal, has Rashad’s fingerprints all over it: classic house synths, a tug-of-war between a thudding low-end and rapid-fire hi-hats and a mantra-like chant, provided by Nasty Nigel: “Pull up/Back door/ID/Plus three.” Album closer “The Infinite Loop,” meanwhile, ends the record on a very different note. Good luck finding Rashad’s contribution in the folds of the impressionistic track, which builds up slowly over the course of eighteen minutes, guided primarily by washes of chiming, delayed guitar provided by Chino Moreno. Nasty Nigel returns here, with a brief, nostalgic verse that steers into the track’s dreamy atmospherics: “Copping 40s at the Wawa outside of Philly/I was only 14, kinda high, my uncle with me.” Even if it hardly sounds like a DJ Rashad song, “The Infinite Loop” feels like a fitting tribute, a contemplative remembrance of a relationship that animated Hook’s work, like so many of those on display here.
9403	12564	"Portland, Ore., is lousy with folk acts, but Musée Mécanique distinguish themselves from the throng by ignoring Americana influences and infusing their brand of intimate melancholia with lush arrangements and electronic underpinnings. While they may not sound like other bands in their local scene, Micah Rabwin and Sean Ogilvie's collective is clearly an integral part of it. Witness their delicate, affecting debut, Hold This Ghost, which features contributions from fine hometown musicians like Laura Gibson and Norfolk & Western's Rachel Blumberg.Despite what their band name may imply, the Northwestern group isn't remotely French, taking their moniker, instead, from a California museum of old-fashioned coin-operated music boxes. The name fits them, as the ambiance they've created on Ghost is, at once, haunted, ornate, wistful for the past, and not of its time. Though almost every song is built on a foundation of gentle guitars, it is the baroque orchestrations of poignant strings, weeping accordions, and flickering organs that give this collection its hazy soul and hypnotic core. Album closer ""Our Changing Skins"" adds flourishes of the singing saw to its dulcet chamber orchestra and chirping-bird samples to temper its sweetness, tinting the tune with a nostalgic sepia tone. And ""The Propellors"" layers a similarly haunting saw swoon over its gauzy melody, illustrating its historical lyrics (""December 17th, 1903/ Propellers turn to wings/ The age of air at hand"") with its otherworldly ambience. The fact that Musée Mécanique choose to tell the story of the Wright Brothers' first flight, not as a celebratory pop song, but as a drowsy, ghostly apparition of one, tells you a lot about their aesthetic.Even their more straightforward acoustic folk songs use subtle, imaginative arrangements to imbue an antique patina to their goosebump-inducing melodies. ""The Things That I Know"", the album's most direct folk song, is built on a fingerpicked base that feels like a whispery Iron & Wine accompaniment, but its fairy-tale glockenspiels add a shimmering weightlessness to the heavy introspection. And ""Somehow Bound"" is the kind of aching, love-lost ballad that Elliott Smith mastered, complete with nakedly depressive lyrics-- ""I hear you laughing through the wall/ It's been two hours, just one call/ Talking on the phone with some guy that I might know/ I hope I don't know."" But by tweaking Smith's acoustic formula with a brooding keyboard drone in the background and twinkling glockenspiels adding a light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel brightness, Musée Mécanique artfully side-step the rote strumming and self-indulgent woe-is-me-ism that plagues many Smiths wannabes.Though their instrumental experimentalism is key to their overall sound, Musée Mécanique owe a great deal of their evocative power to Rabwin's emotive tenor. Like Sufjan Stevens without cheerleaders (or, frankly, cheer), Rabwin has an elegant clarity and regal sadness to his tone and, because he enunciates each word, listeners will not only understand every lyric he sings, but also feel them too. It is that ability to viscerally effect an audience that make Musée Mécanique such a powerful, if unusual, folk force. Their shy yet florid debut is tinged with sadness, like a painted carousel sitting empty in winter, mourning for a time they-- or we-- never even knew."
17695	5754	"Now is the time on Pitchfork when we dance! As part of a court-ordered apology for unleashing Fatboy Slim on an unsuspecting universe, the Astralwerks label has undertaken the incredibly noble task of re-releasing the first three albums by the legendary Düsseldorf duo Neu. The albums are to be played round the clock at Astralwerks HQ; the cheap Crayon graphics of the compact disc are to be pinned on shirts like scarlet letters; all employees are to dance the Robot at all times. We need to praise Neu like we should.As far back as I can remember, the first three Neu albums languished in the Import-only Impossible; the Japanese letters on the sleeves were incomprehensible, but also painfully explicit: prohibitively expensive, they screamed. And now, their stateside release has opened up unimagined worlds to the ears, cheap!And like the band's moniker promises, this music is new. Strange and visionary, but so incredibly familiar. Why? Because a record originally cut in 1972 by a splinter off the indomitable Kraftwerk has seeped into the musical consciousness of a generation; its influence is everywhere. Listening to Neu recalls that giddy, pointless thrill of standing at the Four Corners in the southwestern United States. What's the big deal? Well, nothing, really, except maybe the sense of being in many places at once. That's Neu: standing with cocked German eyebrows at the nexus of shimmering space rock, processed psychedelia, mechanical kraut, and wonderfully libidinal disco.Upon hearing ""Hallo Gallo,"" the first track on Neu, a friend of mine started inadvertently humming an organ line from Tortoise's ""Djed."" That quiet gesture summed up the album for me: listening to the past and hearing so much of the future. But Neu is no mere missing link. ""Hallo Gallo"" is a masterpiece of rhythm: tight drums, funky guitar scratch, a coolly insistent bassline, futuro synths, and effects-laden guitar slinging wide acid-fried launches into deep space. Neu is remarkably economical where its influences cultivate excess: the exploratory guitar and keyboards discover new aural landscapes where the pioneers of prog would remain hours blissfully adrift. ""Hallo Gallo"" is intelligent dance music in every sense of the term: it's the ass inviting the mind out onto the floor. Nobody leads; both are simply in motion.""Sonderangebot"" is a murky soup of noise and silence: an interlude of clanging cymbals, and ambient fuzz, a kind of breathing nebula. The song bleeds darkly into ""Weißensee,"" a droning parade of dirty, cone-filtered guitar that anticipates the pastoral psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and Hochenkeit. ""Negativland"" opens in jackhammer drills and coalesces into a lock-tight, bass-driven martial progression of stabbing guitar and industrial noise: it's dark but strangely danceable. Something like krautpunk: syncopation, cerebral and serrated.Neu is music with the proper documentation: it passes from one musical realm to another without the jackbooted border patrol so much as blinking an eye: this is sound with the highest level security clearance. And when it shifts from one sound to the next, it never winks at you with postmodern irony, never elbows you in the ribs to let you in on the joke. Neu is truly a citizen of the musical universe, at home everywhere and everywhere at once. And Astralwerks' re-release of this phenomenal debut could only serve as a long overdue recognition of this fact. For perhaps without Neu, there would have been no Astralwerks; worse, without Neu there may have been no Pitchfork. Neu anticipates us all. Now who's your daddy? Come on, say it!"
3179	19282	"Ed. note: This week, the reunited Pixies released their first new album in 23 years. Titled Indie Cindy, the record collects material from three EPs released over the past few months. Two of these EPs have been reviewed by Pitchfork, and both received exceptionally low marks. In the interest of avoiding redundancy with another standalone review of this material, we've instead chosen to explore the band's back catalog. Though none of the group's original albums have been reissued recently, they have never been reviewed by Pitchfork.____The great anecdote about the Pixies is that they formed when a college dropout going by the name Black Francis put out an ad for a female bass player who liked both the punk band Hüsker Dü and the folk trio Peter, Paul, and Mary.The Venn diagram here would be tight. Hüsker Dü made noisy, bleeding-heart records for the underground label SST; Peter, Paul and Mary sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon"". Francis got only one response, from a woman named Kim Deal. She had never played the bass before but presumably saw in his ad some sly humor and the spark of liberated thinking that lies behind a bad idea.Crucially, the Pixies weren't from New York or Los Angeles, or even Chicago, but Boston: a famous place but fiercely provincial, with all the reticence of small-town New England and almost no cosmopolitan sheen. We can always depend on Boston for more sports and software engineers. Early on, Francis—a comic-book kid raised in an evangelical church—talked about the band's music with all the pretense of someone fixing toilets or laying shingle. ""You want to be different from other people, sure, so you throw in as many arbitrary things as possible,"" he told the writer Simon Reynolds shortly after their 1988 debut, Surfer Rosa. A few minutes later, the band's drummer, David Lovering, interrupted to describe a video he'd seen of ""people shooting eggs out of their ass, right across the room into another guy's mouth.""The band's songs were about Old Testament Christianity, UFOs and white women who crave sex with big black men—fixations that in certain contexts can turn ordinary people into outcasts. Francis liked the surrealist movies of Luis Buñuel and David Lynch circa Eraserhead, which use violence not as a real-world dynamic but a metaphor for the roiling inner worlds we can cover up but never quite control. On a Surfer Rosa song called ""Cactus"", he begs a woman to cut herself up on a cactus and send him the bloody dress in the mail. For the Pixies, this passes as a ballad. In general they remain solid evidence for the theory that the darkest and most violent thinking is done by the quiet kids next door.In March 1987, the band went into a warehouse studio called Fort Apache and worked for three days straight, producing 18 songs. The project cost a thousand dollars, including printing, tapes, and beer. Eight of these songs were released as Come on Pilgrim on 4AD, an English label that had built a reputation selling, moody, vague bands like Dead Can Dance and the Cocteau Twins but by 1987 had also released some Bulgarian choral music, the number-one dance-pop song ""Pump up the Volume"", and an album by their first American signing, the Throwing Muses. More recently, they've released albums by Deerhunter and Ariel Pink, and in general remain a safe home for uncommon art.Pilgrim is 20 minutes long and more of a hint at what the band could do than anything else. Two of its best songs (""Caribou"" and ""Vamos"") ended up being re-recorded in more muscular forms; another (""Nimrod's Son"") unfortunately wasn't. The other songs from the Fort Apache sessions—which came to be called ""The Purple Tape""—ended up scattered throughout the Pixies catalog, also in stronger versions. As much as the band changed and refined their sound over time, they seemed almost romantically attached to a big-bang concept of their own music, like a person who measures every relationship against that first love.Surfer Rosa is highly combustible music, but slapstick, too. Many of its songs feel half-finished or regurgitated in half-digested form, with verses that run on longer than they ordinarily might, choruses that repeat odd numbers of times instead of even ones, and abrupt shifts in tone and volume. Francis was less of a rock singer than a grotesque impression of one, too angry and too tender, a pantomime of extremes. He sounds new but seems to come from an old place, like an obscure bog predator with alien-looking adaptations.But for all their radical ideas, the Pixies depended on convention—without it, they would have nothing to pick apart. Like Devo or Pere Ubu before them, they were an art-rock band steeped in the 1950s and early 60s, a period of music before rock was considered art. Their songs feed back to surf, boogie, doo-wop and early R&B more easily than anything post-Beatles. The notion that they were changing the shape of alternative rock seemed like a nice bonus but immaterial. In an anecdote from the sessions for the band's 1988 album, Doolittle, Francis told producer Gil Norton that if two-minute songs were good enough for Buddy Holly, they were good enough for him.Doolittle is their most famous album and for understandable reasons. It's more even keel than Surfer Rosa and better mannered, too, forgoing the harsh live sound of Steve Albini for the lush, almost folksy one of Gil Norton, who had had previously worked with marshmallows like Echo and the Bunnymen. Its songs take aim at the big things important art is sometimes supposed to: good and evil, environmental ruin, Bible stories, death. ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" features some allegory about the ozone layer, which in the late 1980s had the same conversational weight and place as ""climate change""; ""Gouge Away"" flirts with Catholicism. ""Hey"" is practically their ""Like a Prayer,"" an oblique gospel anchored by the premise that we too may one day break free our earthly bonds and ascend—a trope art has worked with for much longer than rock music has been around.It's in Doolittle's margins—the faux-hillbilly cackling of ""Mr. Grieves,"" ""There Goes My Gun"" and ""Dead""—that the album becomes what it really is. At heart, the Pixies were a kind of American goth band, fascinated by rural violence, the intersection of lust and danger, creepy innkeepers and the sexual magnetism of strangers who wander into roadside cafés from parts unknown. Their biggest crossover single, ""Here Comes Your Man,"" is less tied to European dada than the rustic imagery of a pulp paperback: The boxcar, the nowhere plains, the big stone and the broken crown.About four years ago I moved from New York to Arizona and found myself listening to the the band's last two albums—1990's Bossanova and 1991's Trompe Le Monde—a lot. It's true what they say about the desert when they say it looks like the moon. Plants and animals seem proud to have survived the odds. Bossanova and Trompe Le Monde make sense to me here, when it's 110 degrees by lunch and the concrete ripples in the heat. They're narrower in scope than Doolittle, and have a tough, inorganic presence, like burnished chrome. But I think what keeps more people from listening to them is that they seem like albums that don't care whether you listen to them or not. Bossanova is sweeter than Trompe, but its sweetness exists at an impossible distance. ""She's my fave, undressing in the sun,"" Francis whispers on the cryptic miniature, ""Ana"". ""Return to sea—bye. Forgetting everyone."" Later, on ""Havalina,"" he spots a javelina—an ornery, boar-like animal not uncommon here—walking across a plain. The music is a slow dance between celestial bodies, heavenly but melancholic. So he sees the boar, and in two short lines, the song is over. Late Pixies songs are triumphs of private epiphany: Small, diamond-bright moments that flash in someone's eyes and then disappear forever.By Trompe Le Monde the band had transitioned from seeming like quiet people who liked violent movies to violent people who didn't make much time for movies at all. This is outlaw music, sharpened by conspiracy theory and too much time with too little human contact. ""I had me a vision/ There wasn't any television/ From looking into the sun,"" Francis sings on ""Distance Equals Rate Times Time"", splitting ""sun"" into two syllables as though to make sure you heard him and are duly disturbed. He still howls and screams, but had also developed a new voice, a flat, posthuman kind of monotone. Trompe is more aggressive than anything in their catalog but also more confident. They can handle this now, and they do.Francis' allusions to Catholicism turned into overt talk about UFOs, which makes sense when you remember that religion has always just been a way to explain the lights in the sky. A kind of concept album emerges, especially toward the album's end: a song about the geography of Mars followed by a song about a burnout named Jefrey—""with one f""—sitting on a carpet with a tabla, thinking about outer space, followed by Francis staring into the sun, a gesture made out of the desperation to find new answers. For however classically far out the Pixies got toward the end, they had also never sounded so grounded. The album's climax, ""Motorway to Roswell"", is half-written from the perspective of an extraterrestrial, but turns on Francis' question: ""How could this so great, turn so shitty?/ He ended up in Army crates."" Reality had never made such a decisive appearance in a Pixies song.The band came together in an unusual way but broke up like anyone else: Creative differences, in-fighting, the collision of fragile egos. Francis went on to make several solo records as Frank Black, one of which is called Teenager of the Year and is the sound of a creative person relinquishing himself of the pressures of being in a famous band and appreciating the practice of not giving a damn. Listen to ""Speedy Marie""; listen to ""Thalassocracy"". Feel the joy and the lightness. Then return to Trompe Le Monde and you can hear how angry Francis had become.Kim Deal moved on to focus on the Breeders, a project with her identical twin Kelley whose albums sound like abstract slumber-party music for teenagers with comfortable access to weed. Last Splash belongs in the Library of Congress, and their subsequent albums—Title TK and Mountain Battles—remain object lessons in how bands can remain weird without ever becoming alienating. After 11 years of separation, the Pixies reunited and went on tour, becoming one of a slew of 80s and 90s alternative bands lobbying for heritage status. Francis never fully reconciled with Deal, who played several of the reunion shows but opted out of recent recording sessions and has embarked on her own time-capsule show, touring Last Splash with the Breeders. Deal's symbolic contributions were as important as her musical ones: The cool, down-to-earth woman who defused Francis' showy angst. She had actually been fired between Doolittle and Bossanova and subsequently rehired, and on later Pixies albums appears just often enough to reminds you that she's in the band.The Pixies have now been reunited for four years longer than they were around to begin with, but are just getting around to releasing a new album, which they have called Indie Cindy. Worse than any of the music is the feeling that a band so deft at challenging the system has become part of it in the most predictable ways, rubbing together the tropes of their old art and hoping they can still start a fire, replacing experimentation with routine, filling Kim Deal's place with not one but two different bassists over the last five months, breaking up the album into three EPs to gin up interest, and generally reminding us that artists of their stature are businesses, not charities.Things start decent and peter out quick. ""What Goes Boom"", ""Greens and Blues"", ""Indie Cindy"": these are slick songs, a little overextended and puffed up, intimidated by the band's legacy but charming in their own way. But part of what made the Pixies interesting is that they always seemed to possess some unquantifiable danger, which they no longer do. Three middle-aged guys seeing what happens when they get back on the horse and try again, they now sound most comfortable when they're being laid-back, ""Greens and Blues"" and the chorus of ""Indie Cindy"" especially. The album's lows aren't so much bad as routine. ""Snakes"", ""Blue Eyed Hexe"", et cetera: these are just distractions, breadsticks.Indie Cindy's title track is built using the template of Bossanova: Spacey and gorgeous, shattered and dissonant, spacey and gorgeous again. Toward the end of the song, Francis offers the line, ""As we follow the bouncing the ball/ They call this dance the washed-up crawl,"" and then, a simple plea: ""Indie Cindy, be in love with me."" Part of loving the Pixies has always been the suspicion that they were gracing us from an alien place somewhere beyond love, where sentiment was never easy or necessary. It may be the most vulnerable line Francis ever wrote."
8100	13949	"Ellen Allien is a pillar of the Berlin electronic music scene. Since she dropped her Boogybytes mix and Sool in 2008, however, she's acted more as a scene curator than an artist, counting just a remix and a single as official releases and instead focusing her energy on BPitch Control's expanding roster and her own fashion label. Watergate 05, a mix for Berlin's famed Watergate club (where Allien holds a DJ residency), not only marks Allien's first full-length release since 2008, it is her latest contribution to a high-profile mix series, following both BPitch's own Boogybytes and her 2007 mix for London's Fabric club.Watergate 05 is the second mix Allien has provided from Watergate-- her 2009 podcast for Resident Advisor was recorded live at the club. Working there seems to have loosened up Allien a bit, as both Watergate and her RA mix are friendlier and jammier than previous deck work. Where Boogybytes felt tightly wound, Watergate is almost schizophrenic, featuring work from looser producers like Matias Aguayo, Luciano, and Röyksopp.Here Allien allows her selections to develop-- Watergate offers just 16 tracks during its hour runtime. This leads to few mixing revelations, placing the focus squarely on Allien's choices. After a ho-hum opening featuring some meticulous but boilerplate techno from John Tejada and DJ Yellow, Niconé & Sascha Breamer's ""Nur Ma Kurz (Philip Bader Remix)"" sets the tone: humid, busy percussion set against earworm vocal samples. It's something Allien returns to with Aguayo's vocal mix of ""Bo Jack"", Allien's own remix of Uffie's ""Pop the Glock"", and AGF/Delay's outstanding Connection (""Heartthrob Remix)"". Finishing the set with Brigitte Fontaine & Khan's ""Fine Mouche (Original Tango Paris Version)"", a wry French piano ballad, is a welcome concession, as it's probably not the type of track you can close a proper live set with.Watergate's main fault is that it's too backloaded: The Uffie and AGF/Delay tracks both appear in the final minutes, as does nsi.'s disquieting remix of Margarat Dygas' ""Hidden Form View"". The mix hinges on longtime Allien pal Apparat's remix of Röyksopp's ""This Must Be It"", which features the Knife's Karin Dreijer Andersson. The remix takes the original's glassy Euro-pop and replaces it with a roiling electro loop, massive enough that it overshadows the mix's excellent back-end.At this point it seems unlikely that Allien is going to submit a truly defining mix; she seems content to use these high-profile gigs to tweak her formula while continuing to build the Berlin scene (as always, several of Allien's friends and collaborators feature here). Watergate 05 can frustrate, but ultimately Allien's ability to differentiate her mixes while retaining her voice makes Watergate a worthwhile addition to her catalog."
13771	6612	"A friend of mine suggested that I give the new Quasimoto album a positive review without even hearing it. He argued that Madlib and his pig-faced sidekick are so unique that critics shouldn't discourage their creativity.  Obviously, that's just not the way it works-- records can't be rewarded purely based on speculation or concept.  Otherwise, Macho Man's Be a Man would be the greatest album of all time.  Those types of comments aren't surprising coming from a Madlib fan, though.  The artist has a vice-like grip on a whole legion of followers, many of which are loyal enough to his creative muse that, for them, the joy of a genuinely rewarding listen is secondary to the joy of just hearing what he cooks up.

    This is actually not awful logic: Madlib's work is generally worth seeking out, even when it's beneath his usual standards.  The problem here is that pieces of Misadventures simply aren't finished.  Who wants to be the first to say it?  I mean, on one hand, if it's unfocused, it's probably because it's a fucking stoner album.  If it's slow, then it's reflective; if it's sparse, then it's minimalist.  But again, taking it at face value, on those terms, would be to gloss over missteps out of deference to the record's concept.  We aren't all stoners, and the sad truth is, ""Bus Ride"" really is just a couple of monotonous Melvin Van Peebles samples, and Madlib's snickerings, lugubrious bloops and weedtalk on ""Greenery"" really aren't all that fascinating.

    I'm a huge Madlib fan, but there's a lot of nonsense here.  Were Madlib not the stoned-face iconoclast we all know and love, it would be easy to point to these kinds of seemingly mindless excursions as pomposity.  (That loop at the end of ""Shroom Music""?  The 30-second Nick at Nite samples?  Come on, dude.)  But Madlib isn't pretentious; he's just imperfect, and when you head into a project like this expecting-- even hoping for-- 27 stream-of-conscious studio experiments, it colors the whole thing differently.

    In Madlib's defense, there is a ton of evidence of his genius at work here.  Shit, cut out a half-dozen two-minute sleepers and the rest of the material is actually rock solid: ""Rappcats, Pt. 3"" buzzes with breakbeat intensity as Quas rips through his all-time favorite MCs, and Doom returns with some Madvillainy shine on ""Closer"".  As an album, though, The Further Adventures of Lord Quas doesn't cut it.  I'll admit that somewhere in here lies a damn strong record, but it takes a lot of fast-forwarding to find it."
8724	13287	"Last year, Grouper released Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill, a record that was not only a personal breakthrough for Liz Harris, but arguably for the Type label as a whole-- an LP so insidiously ingratiating that it just had to be pop at its core, right? So what now that Fred Thomas, he of the erstwhile retro-pop outfit Saturday Looks Good to Me, is now recording as part of City  Center on the same imprint?City Center doesn't necessarily come off like a true pop record, but where Grouper made a point of sounding fully submerged, City Center never go so far that they can't come up for air. Somewhere between early Paw Tracks' folk abstractions and the recent outpouring of lo-fi dream beat, most of City Center is content to drift in and out of its aqueous surroundings like a buoy. The major chords and ringing ambience of ""Killer Whale"" make for a welcoming entrance point, though Thomas' vocals sound like they've been suspended in some kind of gelatin. If you're looking for a commonality between Coldplay's ""Yellow"", Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's ""So Everyone"", and Animal Collective's ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", it's the same ringing B-major chord that begins ""Open/House""-- likewise here, amidst punchy synth kicks, it heralds an unusual display of scrutability even while erratic panning, processed steel drums and plate reverb give it distance.You hear echoes of Thomas' past work on ""Gladest"" and ""Summer School"", which hide otherwise sure-footed progressions under bobbing, waterlogged percussion and bell-timbres. Lyrics are, at best, implications and vocal melodies are content to eddy away with no plans of return. Ultimately, it's the dynamic between melodic resonance (""Young Diamond"") and found-sound obfuscation (the four minutes of ""You Are a Force"" are pregnant with stay amp hum) that defines a debut that I'd call ""promising,"" if only it gave any sort of indication that it was looking to become a part of some sort of artistic arc, as opposed to a stasis with plenty of breathing room-- even when City Center may appear impenetrable, it's still welcoming. C'mon in, the water's great."
5378	16791	"The best pop commits to capturing, but also transcending, the moment that spawns it. And the pop music that's dominated both the indie and mainstream spheres in the past couple of years has documented a couple of recurring trends in particular: the fusion of pop and bombastic, art-damaged fashion (figures as disparate as Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, and Santigold), professions of strength, empowerment and selfhood (from Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" to Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger""), and the sort of glorious, last-night-on-earth hedonism (Ke$ha, LMFAO) that has necessitated not one but many companies to make t-shirts that say ""Sorry For Partyrocking.""So when I say that The Warmest Place, the debut full-length from Australian pop singer Catherine Kelleher, who records as Catcall, feels firmly of this moment, I mean that she effectively has all these bases covered. There's a track with a mid-tempo ""L.E.S. Artistes"" chug called ""Art Star"", there's a song about not feeling lonely when you're alone (""On My Own""), and there's the obligatory dancefloor-ready song that goes ""Another bottle down, then just a little more."" But, through and through, The Warmest Place is so aughts-by-numbers that it already feels like a relic, frozen in a moment it can't quite transcend.It's not hard to pick out the best song on The Warmest Place: It's the lead-off cut, ""August"", which gets things off to a misleadingly promising start. Sounding a little bit like a Glasser track with a harder beat, the synth-driven ""August"" drives towards its bombastic chorus, a single ""Ohhhhh"" that Kelleher holds like she's intent on blowing your house down. Though she's not a particularly distinct vocalist, she's strongest on a song like this one, aiming more for sheer power than emotional nuance, wrapping her voice around abstract monosyllables rather than chattier lyrics. If only ""August"" weren't such an anomaly.There are far more contenders for the worst song on The Warmest Place. It might be the grating and tasteless ""Paralysed"" (""Ooh, ooh I cannot move/ I am a-paralysed/ Aaah!"") on which Kelleher's vocal sounds so stilted and stiff that it's baiting me with all sorts of ""Paralysed"" puns that I'll respectfully let pass. Maybe it's ""Art Star"", on which Catcall lobs a couple of softball insults (""I told my girlfriends your name/ They say they've seen you and you've got no game"") that-- although they're backed by a playful, Le-Tigre-at-the-roller-disco beat-- have about as much sass as a wet noodle. (She pauses so long between each line that you start to worry that she's going to fall asleep before she reaches the end rhyme.) But the worse offense is probably the face-palmingly literal ""Swimming Pool"", on which the Euro-trash synth sunbursts are as awkwardly porny as the lyrics (""Goosebumps all over/ Nipples harden""). If hell is an American Apparel, this song plays there on loop.It's easy to pick out Catcall's influences (the single, ""The World Is Ours"", has a Sleigh Bells-esque chant and a cheerleader themed video, while ""I Believed""'s bassline is a dead ringer for the Gossip's ""Standing in the Way of Control""), but pastiche isn't the record's greatest crime. Instead, it's its refusal to do anything new with the reference points it wears on its sleeve. Because as tuned into the pop cultural moment as these songs are, something about the atmosphere they document feels oddly blank, devoid of the slightest lyrical texture or detail. For example, the snoozy cover of the Passions' ""I'm In Love With a German Film Star"" is the vaguest imaginable meditation on flashbulbs and fame; that the titular love interest is an actor at all seems to stem from the fact that someone wanted to rhyme ""movie"" with ""it really moved me."" And ""Art Star"" is even more puzzling. Centered around the flat taunt, ""Grow up/ Grow up,"" there's nothing in the song to give it any specificity or bite: the only lyric that reveals anything about the person she's supposedly roasting is ""You're such an art star/ Uh-huh."" That the word ""art"" is uttered at all in a song this unimaginative adds an unintended layer of irony.The thing is, there's already a song called ""Art Star"". It appeared on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' self-released 2001 EP, and a few years later Brazilian partyrockers CSS reheated that same conceit on the goofy-but-fun ""Artbitch"" (""I only show where there's free alcohol""). Both of these songs now feel dated in their own ways: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' track captures something of the skuzzy, neo-no wave scene in New York just moments before most of its major players got scooped up by major labels, and the CSS album that spawned ""Artbitch"" has songs called ""Meeting Paris Hilton"" and ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above."" As novel as those things might seem now, they're preserved because the artists who made them were committed to the moment they found themselves in, however garish and grimy and absurd. Though not without a few fleeting moments of campy fun, The Warmest Place feels mostly like a time capsule from a blank world."
18049	7949	"Squirm (aka German electronica) is back, and while still not primed for attack, it's now capable
    of delivering a crucial payload. Arch-squirmers Tarwater-- an offshoot of the squirmily
    palindromic To Rococo Rot-- have finally raised the bar. Before Animals, Suns and Atoms,
    I judged squirm by the Notwist's crunchy outsider-electro LP, Shrink.  Released on
    Stereolab's Duophonic label, Shrink elevated squirm from two-minute patch-corded
    interludes to album-length approximations of the unrealized soundclash between Can's Schloss
    Nörvenich acid excursions and our post-drum-n-bass ProTools culture.
    Frontman Ronald Lippok lazily states the facts and repercussions of insect disappearance as
    percussive blips and Farfisa-generated choir cloak his reminiscences, while encouraging us to
    ""Come on down/ Break it up."" With one foot firmly placed in the same puddle of pop irresistibility
    as Britney Spears' Swedish producer, and the other in that grand Kraut-rock tradition, this
    track, ""All the Ants Have Left Paris,"" sounds like the perfect combination of high-falutin'
    avant-garde expression and low-brow pop thrills.  At least, until the following track, ""Noon,""
    lollops in and fulfills our dreams of Kate Bush taking a shot at the genre with warm pianos
    and swaggering percussion clicks.
    As Lippok mutters, ""Abuse committed by criminals itself commits a crime,"" a female accomplice
    harmonizes in a Zanax fog. Underneath, a student learns to play the sitar until a ""European
    Son""-like attack of the John Cales overcomes his reverence for the instrument, and he
    throttles it.  Of course, Tarwater, like the camera-wielding kid next door in ""American
    Beauty,"" are fascinated by this strangulation and give it prominence.
    ""The Trees"" is a far less energetic track than ""Ants,"" but Lippok nonetheless snaps at his Dada
    chorus (""Don't ever antagonize the home"").  His strangely unnerving vocals are propelled by a
    nagging cello and percussive mouth harp as he reveals, ""I like to yell when it's snowing.""
    I'm sure his neighbors appreciate that.
    But the band saves their oddest and most surreptitious moments for last.  On ""Seven Ways to
    Fake a Perfect Skin,"" Tarwater act out their fantasies of becoming one of Brian Eno's oblique
    strategies (or, at the very least, an out-take off Here Come the Warm Jets).  Giddy
    analog synth loops and plucked harpsichord haunt the background. But Tarwater's frivolity is
    offset by Lippok's sinister whibble and fake London accent.
    On Animals, Suns and Atoms, Tarwater have finally realized that though analog mood sauce
    can be spread over phat hip-hop beats, it doesn't mean it necessarily should be.  After all,
    they have to do better than the Notwist's ""Day 7"" and ""Chemicals"" at some point. Those two
    superb Notwist tracks defined the direction in which squirm should be headed. I want to hear
    outsider vocals accompanied by skewed, electronic cracks, blips, and a hearty gutbucket of
    hip-hop funk.
    I'm thrilled that Lippok and Jestram have picked up on the Notwist tactic. Tarwater have easily
    equaled Shrink in terms of effectiveness and creativity.  They've captured the funk of
    Ege Bam Yasi-era Can, run it through with a provocative dub disquiet, and ended up
    with an album that marks new heights in electronic music.  Here is an album I'll return to
    frequently.  It's your squirm now!"
16171	5817	"There's so much to fear in New York right now: Fed-Exed nukes from North Korea, low-grade Uranium shavings cast from the top of the Empire State building as
    cheapo fallout, a smallpox outbreak carried through the subway tunnels it was hard enough climbing stairs thinking \x93Any moment now, I could slip and break my
    neck.\x94 And yet, as I dwell on the unlikely finality of that snap, the supposedly impending revolution care of New York City's No-Neck Blues Band is one thing I'm not
    particularly worried about, even as they haunt my dreams in Mysterio clouds of sulfur and patchouli smoke, their satchels filled with obscure Don Cherry records,
    poisonous berries, and bearded songster scores found in dumpsters outside rehearsal spaces.
    \x93Witch\x94 eases things open with great haunted promise, snaking its way up the river between Apocalypse Now-era Rhythm Devils and the Doors' distended psychedelic
    menace, writhing and enticing great reptilian figures to surface, their faces slick with mud.  \x93Play Your Play\x94 comes on in home-stitched priest gowns, the trails and
    runners wavering in and out of the physical realm as cloth drags along the ground, taking a few minutes to really get to the tom-tapped ceremony of accordion and organ
    drones, slowly attaining a chilled plateau they sustain for nearly twelve minutes. The sprawling \x93The Shepherd Takes a Shine to the Abyss\x94 that closes the album is the most
    exquisite exploration of the bunch, and as beautiful as anything they've ever conjured up. Building from spider-silk strands of cello and acoustic bass, its lightly delayed
    guitars slowly coalesce to stand upright, merging the bratty sax bleats into a wholesome peace.
    But the magic and smokescreens run out of steam in the middle of the record: \x93Open That Grass Cax94 begins to piddle and plink, revealing bored revelers behind their
    renaissance wardrobe, their rope-and-wood machines petering then falling apart. The title track only has its punny name going for it, a dorm-sponsored, smoke-out
    drum circle; \x93This Absent-Minded Crisis?\x94 is two minutes of baby babble even Yoko Ono couldn't entertain.
    \x93Fuck-No\x94 at least has the good sense to steal Sun Ra's cosmically therapeutic drum reverb, guaranteeing lift-off, but the captain comes out of the cabin dressed like an
    orangutan from a novelty calendar, making oogy-googy noises in utter disdain for Ra's muumuu. Twelve minutes in, pecked notes and monkey-scat-- not to mention a
    wooden train whistle-- thoroughly derail the piece.
    While a small beam of light fell upon their Harlem loft with a record they wrangled out on John Fahey's Revenant label-- earning critical accolades from high places-- the
    group remains relatively obfuscated, rarely playing shows and splintering into multiple personalities to obscure their different trails. Their early releases are pure handmade
    loveliness, sheathed in mystifying, artful packages, the music mashing together Cromagnon, Alan Sondheim, Father Yod, and other privately-pressed wax icons to the point where
    picking apart their influences became a futile exercise in bogus alchemy. Each was its own potent dose, and full gnosis was never quite possible when absorbing them;
    unfortunately, Intonomancy is a shoddier stone tablet, a wearisome simplification of their decade-old primitivism. Their music, now much more clearly recorded, finally reveals
    itself more sloth than Thoth."
4391	17882	"From the spluttering hardcore of their first LP through wildcard bassist Cris Kirkwood's lost years, Meat Puppets seemed to chase chaos, musical and otherwise. So when Cris, fresh off a few particularly rocky years, rejoined brother Curt Kirkwood in 2006, once-bitten fans didn't know what to expect, save a certain amount of mania. What they got was anything but: starting with 2007's Rise to Your Knees, the Meat Puppets got good and mellow, trading in their frenzied pacing and Spirograph guitars for a surprisingly even-keeled, weirdness-averse, country-tinged amble.Rat Farm, the Puppets' 14th studio LP, finds the brothers Kirkwood continuing to take things easy. Curt's been calling Rat Farm ""real blown-out folk music,"" playing up its compositional simplicity and explaining away its lack of fretboard melée. Rat Farm's pop jangles and crisp country workouts don't feel all that much straighter than the band's other post-reunion LPs, and there are still hints (however fleeting) of the Meat Puppets of old in Rat Farm's ragged harmonies, permafried geniality, and Curt's wide-eyed fascination with the natural world. But all that remarkable stuff that's been lost to the Puppets' gradual mellowing-- the hardcore furor, the Deadhead twinkle, the sunburnt boogie-- hasn't been replaced by, well, much of anything. Which leaves the perfectly pleasant Rat Farm feeling strangely wanting.""Everything's cool, and everything's fine,"" Kirkwood sings at the top of ""Waiting"", quickly adding ""and everything drives me out of my mind."" That's kind of the trouble with Rat Farm: everything's fine, but that's about the long and short of it. Whether it's the Byrdsy stroll of ""You Don't Know"", a post-grunge chopper ""Leave Your Head Alone"", or a countrypolitan swoon like ""Waiting"", everything here unfolds as you'd expect it to, amicably enough, but with a distinct lack of adventure. The mood's convivial, the tempos are easygoing, and the solos—when they happen at all—are clipped. Sure, some things'll never change: Curt still sings like he's holding in a lungful, and there's a certain wobbliness to the arrangements that never lets you forget who you're listening to. But culling the chaos from their sound doesn't exactly flatter what remains, and with every layer of weirdness they shed, some personality follows.Still, the smile stretched across Rat Farm's face does wonders for the hints of blankness behind its eyes. Curt's mind remains bent, even as his songs have straightened themselves out; Rat Farm's world is populated by a mechanical money, a yard full of cats and rabbits, and the titular Kirkwood-owned home for rodents. Dual highlights ""Down"" and ""Time and Money"" allude to adult concerns-- parenthood and cash-flow, respectively-- but even they never seem too far from a shrug and the crack of a beer. At its best, Rat Farm is warm, well-executed, and slightly goofy; that won't be enough for everybody, but for the Kirkwoods circa 2013, it seems to be plenty. "
9923	12042	"With oblique angles, high contrast, and blur, photographer Moriyama Daido has famously transfigured Japan's urban prosaic-- sewer gratings, stray dogs, strippers, bar patrons-- into stark, defamiliarizing visual poetry. This year, Finnish singer/multi-instrumentalist Laura Naukkarinen (aka Lau Nau), will provide the backdrop to an exhibition of Moriyama's prints with her own work. The pairing makes sense when you hear the first track of Lau Nau's sophomore album, Nukkuu. ""Lue Kartalta"" plucks, whistles, sings, and rings an almost-violent clash of pentatonic notes, converging in a discordant melee. Asian insinuations aside, Lau Nau's composition, like Moriyama's images, argues against complacency, taking sometimes-familiar/sometimes-not instruments and sounds and throwing them into a disorienting, disruptive new context.Lau Nau has further scored several contemporary screenings of silent film classics (including, intriguingly, Carl Dreyer's gorgeous, solemn The Passion of Joan of Arc). Playing a subordinate role to others' work may seem incongruous given Lau Nau's distinct, obtrusive style, but her music just happens to be remarkably flexible. The album translates to ""sleep"", and I've taken afternoon naps to its wisped strands of melody and hypnotic drones. I've also, as on one soupy, heat-paralyzed day in July waiting for the bus with my iPod, become agitated, almost panicked, by ""Rubiinilasia""'s confrontational drum punches, spooked moans and emergency sirens. Music for airports-- and chain retailers-- it ain't.Of course, songs whose lyrics are lost in translation will always adapt more easily to a listener's environment or mental states. Record buyers outside of Finland will hear the relatively obscure tongue sung here as sleek syllabics phrased as incomprehensible incantations, it's easy to understand why someone might put Nukkuu to use as ambient backdrop. But the album-- steeped in new folk's idioms, particularly its psychedelic tangles of string, wind, and percussive instruments and Lau Nau's delicate, breathy, multitracked soprano-- does reward active listening, whether you seek out lyrical translations or not. ""Painovoimaa, Valoa"" is a ravishing lullaby adorned by Nukkuu's most lucid and insinuating melody, and rendered strange by the rusty creak of the jouhikko, or lap-violin. Another highpoint,  ""Vuoren Laelle"" is a simple, measured, and beautiful piano-accompanied duet.Nukkuu also reflects Finland's underground scene's experimental credos: tonal collisions, eerie piecing and sampling (such as ""Mooste's"" music box figment), and a vaguely pagan ceremonial vibe (""Jouhet"" sounds like a sacrifice to a sun god, or possibly an alien landing). Naukkarinen migrated to her country's isolated hinterlands after the recent birth of a son, but her CV documents her tenure in collectives including Kiila, Hertta Lussu Ässä, and Avarus, and she recruited former colleague Pekko Käppi, as well as partner Antti Tolvi, to support her on Nukkuu. Lau Nau's press materials report that the album was written and recorded in the stolen intervals spacing her child's naps, and that it reflects her newfound rural domestic bliss. As lovely (and convenient from a marketing standpoint) as this narrative reads, Nukkuu doesn't actually depart much from its also-excellent predecessor, 2005's Kuutarha. Which is probably a good thing. Lau Nau's chosen medium offers ample room for variation and growth. And with the exception of scene flagship, Paavoharju, Finland's exciting sounds have only slowly, sparingly slipped its borders. So Lau Nau's ethereal vocals, original structures and arcane orchestra of instruments (that include, according to the liners, Estonian 10-string kantele, baby phones, Russian candy bird flute and homemade horsehair bows), are all still refreshingly new to most of us."
8859	12912	"Since Sam Shalabi enjoyed his mini-breakout in 2004 with the Shalabi Effect's The Trial of St. Orange, the Montreal  composer has explored the overlap between popular Western music and traditional  Middle Eastern musics, particularly those from Egypt, the country from  which Shalabi's parents hailed. These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: Shalabi works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, Shalabi's newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of Thomas Pynchon's Against the Day.Like fellow Constellation traveler  Efrim Menuck (A Silver Mt. Zion, Godspeed You! Black Emperor), who helped  record and mix Against the Day, Shalabi has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced Shalabi's  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. Against the Day's mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.As always, Shalabi's realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s Egyptian orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of Shalabi's early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""Iceland Spar"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day.""The centerpiece of Against the Day  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by Molly Sweeney-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When Sweeney sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack.Shalabi's troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of Shalabi's murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""Iceland Spar"" and ""Bilocations""  make it seem as if Shalabi is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. Shalabi sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the  Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. Shalabi trades in movements, not moments, though,  and Against the Day's frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination."
17803	8114	"There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come
    to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it
    has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies,
    powerful arrangements-- these are the things of American anthems. Up until now,
    most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there
    are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from
    hummable.  Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only
    two feet.  Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine Brian
    McMahan singing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" without lulling 10,000 grunting
    sports fans into a deep sleep.
    It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects
    of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement
    since its inception. Standards, the group's fourth full-length, takes
    their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously
    unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness.  Not only is it the most
    acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the
    most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to
    date.
    I credit much of the increased fun factor on Standards to the more
    dominant role of guitarist Jeff Parker, whose work with Isotope 217 has proven
    that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though
    Parker's presence was a welcome addition to the band on TNT, he seems
    to have really come into his own as a band member on Standards, and his
    versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they
    also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at
    times lacked.
    But to give Parker the preponderance of the credit for the more playful,
    exploratory nature of Standards would be unfair; Standards is
    the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course
    of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as Miles Davis, Tom
    Zé, Jimi Hendrix, Philip Glass, Suicide, Brian Eno, Parliament, and spaghetti
    westerns and sci-fi flicks alike.  But what makes this album truly impressive
    is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation
    of these complex sources.  Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial
    elements from a variety of genres, Standards sees the band truly
    reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up American flag on
    the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity
    to revisit an entire history of American music-- from jazz through dance and
    electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own.
    Appropriately, Standards kicks off with a bang: the unrestrained,
    gorgeous blast of noise that opens its first track, ""Seneca."" As John McEntire
    wails on his drumkit even more aggressively than he did in his wild Bastro
    days, Jeff Parker's guitar intones a simple, highly melodic riff. The phrasing,
    and the explosive energy of McEntire's playing, leaves these few simple notes
    sounding utterly huge. After this pattern repeats, ""Seneca"" metamorphoses into
    a more complex, but equally dynamic track, that combines all the tenets of the
    traditional post-rock sound with some tasty new extras. As the beautiful chaos
    of the song's intro fades away, McEntire chimes in with what is perhaps the
    single most compelling beat he has produced over the course of his career,
    every bit as primal as it is astoundingly complex.
    With such diverse sonic elements as handclaps, backwards distorted guitars and,
    yes, vibraphones, ""Seneca,"" like many other tracks on Standards,
    succeeds in expanding the traditional post-rock sound. ""Eros"" follows, building
    upon a foundation of Latin-tinged percussion and a thick bass groove with
    intermittent sonar blips, spastic, squelching analog synth, and wah-wah
    guitar. As with the best of Tortoise, these tracks can be enjoyed on many
    levels, but when listened to carefully, they reveal seemingly infinite sonic
    treasures.
    The latter half of Standards sees Tortoise breaking even farther away
    from the trappings of traditional post-rock. ""Blackjack,"" one of the album's
    many high points, combines a guitar melody that could have been lifted directly
    off of a '60s Morricone score with high-pitched dance synthesizers and a
    straightforward, commanding beat. Whereas most of the tracks on TNT
    were written in the studio, and often fell victim to a high aimless noodling
    factor, the band composed most of Standards ahead of time, and as a
    result, ""Blackjack,"" along with the other nine songs on the album, are
    beautifully structured, and develop flawlessly from beginning to end.
    Tortoise has always been a band that thrives on subtlety.  With Standards,
    they've finally managed to arrange those subtleties to form broad, bold sonic
    outlines.  As a result, this record is by far the most intense, compelling,
    and memorable Tortoise has released to date.  With its potent combination of
    the powerhouse wallop of rock and roll and the aural intricacy of jazz,
    minimalism, and electronica, Standards serves as the first Tortoise
    album that's every bit as exciting as it is intriguing."
670	21979	RLYR began by accident. In 2013, Pelican guitarist Trevor Shelley de Brauw and Locrian percussionist Steve Hess, both mainstays within the fertile fringes of Chicago’s rock scene, received an invitation to travel two hours north to Milwaukee and debut as an improvisational duo. Despite their geographic and stylistic proximity, Hess and de Brauw had never played together before, so they practiced, soon discovering the festival’s ask had been a fortuitous one—their approaches clicked, and they wanted to continue. Traces of songs emerged from the informal rehearsals, so they decided to build from an exploratory duo to a power trio, recruiting former Russian Circles bassist and busy band member at large, Colin DeKuiper. Less than three years later, Delayer—the band’s radiant four-song, forty-minute start—funnels the distortion and power of its members’ pedigrees into post-rock that is positively cheery. At its best, Delayer offers a smile and demands, quite loudly, that you share it.Each piece of RLYR, pronounced “Relayer,” boasts a high-volume past. Pelican, for instance, is the very emblem of instrumental post-metal, long led by de Brauw’s burly, refined riffs. Russian Circles belong in that same conversation. And since Hess enlisted in Locrian a half-decade ago, that trio has become one of extreme metal’s most fascinating bands, taking the kinds of textural and thematic chances that push them to and against the genre’s often-obdurate edges.These extremes of heaviness and dynamics remain intact on Delayer. The guitar and bass that slash between Hess’ big-bottom beats throughout “Reconductor” carry the weight of doom metal; a mid-song escalation even delivers an instrumental acknowledgement of the recent thrash revival. “Delayer,” a four-minute span of rhythm-less bedlam, recalls a more primitive take on the sophisticated din of Locrian, in which tendrils of synthesizer and guitar, manipulated drums and mangled vocals spin into complex musical webs. And you could write a stoner metal opus from one small sample of the 23-minute “Descent of the Night Bison,” where DeKuiper and de Brauw fight beneath a tough shell of amplifier crackle. As the song pivots toward climax, Hess flirts with a blast beat.But that’s just Delayer’s surly surface, the necessary vestiges of musicians who have made their reputations in or at least around metal. By and large, these songs glow from the core, built with an underlying, unabashed sense of optimism. Something about the repetition of “Slipstream Summer,” for instance, suggests the blues; the riff and rhythm constantly wrap around themselves, stuck in a cycle from which they can’t slip free. Late in the song, though, de Brauw punches through a veil of low, murky roar, the high notes of his guitar becoming the sunlight suddenly breaking through storm clouds. And the churning “Reconductor” soundtracks some heroic feat, a victory obtained against all odds. You may find yourself cheering along.Delayer, or four songs by a rock ’n’ metal power trio, isn’t a monumental achievement, nor does it aim to be. These forty minutes simply feel good, their ecstatic embrace of electricity and pounded drums occasionally conjuring some action movie’s apogee. But the real coup is a more subtle one. This sort of dude-driven post-rock and post-metal is so often the domain of the dour, with moods as low as the tunings. Like Collections of Colonies of Bees’ most masterful moments almost a decade ago, though, Delayer suggests a victory not over abject depression but over relative contentment. It’s more liftoff than life raft, a reflection of good times rather than a reckoning of the bad ones. This is uncommonly optimistic post-rock, then, deliberately using the strength of the style’s sound to summon something more than temporary fury.        
4861	17251	"The Fader has a regular feature called ""The Things I Carry"" in which artists share what's in their pockets. A recent subject was Himanshu Suri, better known as Heems of Das Racist, the divisive, allusive, and pop culture savvy rap trio. Heems, along with the usual pocket regulars (keys, wallet) and an elephant totem from his girlfriend, was carrying a $30,000 check from Kmart, given to him in exchange for the rights to the Das Racist song ""Girl"" for use in a layaway commercial. When I saw that check, I was annoyed. But while complaints about materialism in rap are common, it's easy to forget that rappers are character-creators, to whom flashiness is a way to promote an artistic brand. If I'm OK with other rappers' excess, why wasn't I willing to understand Heems from within the same context? Because of the way he looks, or where he went to school? At its best, Heems' music raises these sorts of questions, challenging the assumptions and double standards of rap fan groupthink. The question that has to be asked now that he's been playing these tricks for a couple years is simple: Can this philosophy make for compelling music?In short, yes. His new mixtape Wild Water Kingdom is the most substantial solo project full-length associated with Das Racist to date, because it merges the academic underpinnings of Heems' ideas with thoroughly listenable rap music. Though he's still not the best rapper (his refusal to abide by traditional rhyme schemes will be frustrating to purists) he's made great strides here and is helped along by a NYC underground producer showcase.Those beats, unfortunately, are forced to sustain the album's first quarter. Heems comes out swinging on ""Cowabunga Gnarly"", a banger from producer-of-the-year candidate Harry Fraud, but quickly loses steam, and resorts to his lazy reference overdrive, a trick which lost its novelty a couple years ago. Claiming, right after you declare your appreciation Junot Diaz, that you're ""as smart as three SAT's,"" is fine, I guess, but the facts are unrelated. And the Crookers-produced ""Third Thing"" has a great singalong hook, but there's way too much nonsense in the amateurish verses.Luckily, things do take a turn for the better. Around the halfway point of the title track, another Harry Fraud production (this one replete with gorgeous sitar strings), Heems decides to turns it on. ""Freedom, put the heat up, who scheming for cheese/ believe in them please/ they need us to reach/ a piece with the place/ that's filled with the trees."" These lines are rapped more fiercely and quickly than anything before, and they refer back to the family that Heems reps throughout the song, and the tape. And for the fans of the old Das Racist shtick, there's still an absurd Princess Diana line nestled a couple of bars later.It used to be hard to tell if Heems wanted to be a rapper or if he wanted to make people who love rap angry. That's mostly gone now. This guy wants it, and his earnestness occasionally boils over, to the point of sappiness. Not sure if anyone realized that collaborator Safe sounds a lot like Dave Matthews, but the resemblance, and the resulting campfire vibe is enough to kill the otherwise tolerable ""Medium Green Eyes"".More often, this newfound ability to speak plainly is a huge advantage for Heems. ""Deepak Choppa"", one of the best offerings here, is politically aware and seems truly angry, rather than bitter or sarcastic. ""You know that we could send you back/ at any given time/ it ain't like money that you stack/ money for a lawyer/ that's the money that you lack,"" he raps from the perspective of an immigration agent, before transitioning into a different flow. On the second half of the song, he takes on race, repping his New York roots and his family and asking that you test his credentials: ""I ain't black/ I ain't white/ I can't rap/ I can't write/ I ain't strapped/ I could fight."" This isn't a sneer, it's a challenge.In rap purist communities, the inability of some blog rappers to rap well is a well-documented gripe. Hearing a song like ""Tell Me"", in which two of the most disparaged targets wile out out over a huge beat from Earth 2's version of Just Blaze (producer Mike Finito), is some kind of head turner. Haters are still going to hate lines like Gambino's ""Rush Limballin while I'm listening to tUne-yarDs"" or Heems' spitting ""Chamomile tea that we pour with splash."" But those listeners will have to ask themselves-- would they hate these lines if they were coming from sources like Dipset, Roc Marciano, or Action Bronson?Of course, those are the kinds of questions Heems has always provoked. Now that he's rapping well, that purpose is free to slide into focus. On Wild Water Kingdom, it's hard to argue with the beats. For the most part, it's hard to argue with the raps. You're going to have to ask yourself, if this guy is still bothering you, what exactly is it that you don't like? Because if it's the way he looks, or the references he's making, congratulations: you're now that guy who's too conservative to listen to rap music."
1706	20788	"Filipino black metal trio Deiphago, who formed in Manila but have been based in Costa Rica since 2004, are but one testament to the global reach of metal. They're indebted to the black metal of two Canadian bands, Blasphemy and Conqueror, as well as the Brazilian primitivism of Sarcofago, but play with a looseness not quite fitting any of those groups. Even by the lo-fi fetish standards of black metal, Deiphago commit to a chaos few bands could match. A more polished Deiphago record seems antithetical, but that's what Into the Eye of Satan, their fourth full-length, is to an extent. In the hand of noted metal producer Colin Marston, we see a more complete version of the band. In Eyes, the chaos isn't squelched, just illuminated. From ""Evil and Adverse"", it's obvious their actual playing hasn't changed much, but Marston's production makes you better appreciate their muscularity. Guitarist Sidapa's leads are more prominent in the mix. ""Bloodbath of Genocide"" features wah-wah swaths in the beginning that would have gone unnoticed before, and these minor details add up. His mini-solos in ""6x6x6/3"" sound more like the playing of a college kid obsessed with free jazz and Thurston Moore than conventional shredding. Sidapa sounds most bizarre in ""Calculated Acts of Cruelty"" and the title track closer, abandoning any conceits of fluidity. Peaks become valleys without warning and notes criss-cross into tangled weaves.With improved production, Eye inadvertently reveals the hardcore influence—especially that of d-beat groups like Discharge—that's always been latent in Deiphago's music. Drummer Savnok opts for a looser, punkier style. Vocalist/bassist Voltaire 666's bass may sound less distorted, but it's never sounded meaner. Deiphago may be the true successors of Venom, who brought endearing sloppiness and fuck-all attitude to the creation of black metal. All this, combined with Sidapa's guitar work, finds Deiphago oddly, if pleasingly, working against their own credo. They're not afraid to proclaim ""Fuck off to the false!"", but Eye is less straitlaced than many of their peers' works. Deiphago's other records may have served as a litmus test for how much discordance you can handle in metal; this is where you fully realize just how serious they are."
1982	20462	"In recent years, we've seen plenty of indie-world talents—like St. Vincent's Annie Clark, the National's Bryce Dessner, and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood—crossing over into the realm of contemporary classical music. (Dessner and Arcade Fire instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry are even working on a collaborative piece for the New York Philharmonic, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit?Tyondai Braxton is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album Central Market—a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the Wordless Music Orchestra, released on Warp Records in 2009 (while he was still a member of Battles). At the time, the record signaled Braxton's growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (""Pulse March""), contributed a track to a Philip Glass remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn.The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of Braxton's HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, Braxton had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive live reviews—and additional performances in other locations—the Nonesuch label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled HIVE1, which was recorded over a two-year span.I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair—but as a home-listening experience, HIVE1 is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like Edgard Varèse with his own prodigious beat-making skills, Braxton has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which Karlheinz Stockhausen's ""Zyklus"" bumps up against Vision Creation Newsun-era Boredoms remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges.""Gracka"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs—right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for HIVE1's most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer Mauricio Kagel's music demonstrates). But on my initial HIVE1 listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip?Thankfully, it's on ""Studio Mariacha""—with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations—that HIVE1 takes off for real. The following number, ""Amlochey"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph—and then it's all done.Overall, it's clear that HIVE1 doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of Braxton's, ""Casino Trem"", has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named the Bang on a Can All-Stars—and appearing on that group's latest album, Field Recordings—""Casino Trem"" contains some HIVE1-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of Central Market. Braxton's seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas HIVE1 can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live."
12267	9361	"As an artist and a conundrum, Bob Dylan is well-versed in semi-hysterical critical hyperbole. With each new record since 1997's stellar Time Out of Mind, music writers and editors have been tripping all over themselves trying to sputter out the best, most dramatic encapsulation of Dylan's rebirth (which, given the relative late-career flops of his peers and his own 1980s shitstorm, still seems strange and thrilling). Now, 45 years into a perfectly studied, over-anthologized, well-chronicled career, even talking about the cult-of-Dylan seems clichéd: Analysis of Dylan-love, Dylan-backlash, Dylan-histrionics, and Dylanology is moot. Books have been published, academic treatises have been defended, documentaries have been ordered and directed, cover stories have been savored and parsed-- but every time Bob Dylan cranks out a new record, we still try, again, to figure out what it all adds up to.
Modern Times is Bob Dylan's 31st studio LP, and an obvious companion piece to 2001's Love and Theft, offering new tracks of jazz-inspired, rockabilly-scamming, ragtime-aping rock'n'roll, more heavily indebted to blues and honky-tonk than Woody Guthrie and Folkways. The record does little to persuade disbelievers, will continue to infuriate those who cheered when Pete Seeger jerked the plug at Newport, and isn't entirely unfamiliar: Anyone who's seen Dylan play in the past five years will recognize the silhouette here, hunched over a keyboard, all crags and angles, brambles of hair puffing out from under a big black hat, pencil mustache combed into place, pounding keys, infinitely more compelled by his fellow players than his sycophantic audience. Unsurprisingly, Modern Times is musically intricate, thick, and expertly played, more the product of a well-rehearsed-- but still gorgeously mellow-- band than an auteur. It also contains some of the softest, funniest, and most charming songs of Dylan's late career, as he snickers to himself, cooing about love, God, and doing it (""I got the pork chops/ She got the pie"").
    Dylan recently spat a series of (now-notoriously) curmudgeonly comments to Jonathan Lethem in Rolling Stone, pining that nothing sounds like shellac-- and while his complaints seemed depressingly stodgy, they were also promptly misconstrued and yanked out of context; as it were, Dylan was deriding contemporary production/studio techniques and not the whole of modern music, which becomes instantly and weirdly obvious to anyone who listens to the lyrics to raucous opener ""Thunder on the Mountain"" (""I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't help from crying/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line/ I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be/ I been looking for her even clean through Tennessee""), or considers the fact that Dylan produced this record himself (under favored stage-name Jack Frost).

    Still, it's obvious that Dylan's most beloved songs are old ones, and he borrows gleefully from Nina Simone, Memphis Minnie, Carl Perkins, Muddy Waters, and, in the grand tradition of AP Carter and John Lomax, plenty of unnamed songwriters whose work long ago slipped into public domain. ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"" (Muddy Waters famously recorded the song in 1950, but its origins date back to at least 1929) is given a new workup, infused with Dylan's signature clatter and wheeze and punched up with peppery guitar and even spicier lyrics (""I got trouble so hard, I just can't stand this dream/ Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains""). Meanwhile, ""Nettie Moore"" (a well-worn 19th century ballad) is staggering, a spare blend of vocals and light, airy instrumentation, Dylan's decaying pipes tut-tutting sweet proclamations of love: ""When you're around me/ All my grief gives way/ A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day/ Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong."" ""Workingman's Blues 2"" is similarly gentle and lapping, and ""The Levee's Gonna Break"", with its familiar Zeppelin-via-Memphis-Minnie refrain (""If it keeps on raining/ The levee's gonna break""), seems almost self-referential (""I paid my time/ And now I'm as good as new…Some of these people are gonna strip you of all they can take"").

    The biggest disappointment here is that Modern Times is probably Dylan's least-surprising release in decades-- it's the logical continuation of its predecessor, created with the same band he's been touring with for years, fed from familiar influences, and sprinkled with all the droll, anachronistic bits now long-expected. Dylan's voice, sinking further into grit, is all wheeze and mew, rolled in salt but still instantly recognizable. And now that he's eyebrows-deep in the rock'n'roll canon, maybe the heart-stopping appeal of Bob Dylan has less to do with his output-- which, tangentially, remains outstanding-- and more to do with his cowboy boot-saunter. Maybe we all want a little bit of Dylan's superhuman restraint, and whether it's real or brutally calculated doesn't actually matter: The fuck-off detachment, the unconcerned genius, the squinty-eyed disdain, the arid, gut-punching humor, the total (if feigned) disinterest in his growing superhero status. He's the boy who doesn't love us back, the one everyone yearns for, the Holy Grail, the last American hero.

16256	2441	"Musicians don't exist on desert islands, isolated from human contact, any
    more than other folks.  This piece of (seeming) common sense sometimes
    gets lost in the shuffle when discussing the effects of music: It's often
    described in similar terms as a natural disaster-- ""it moved me""; ""the music
    blew me away""; ""it destroyed all my expectations"".  Thus, the creators of
    the stuff are indirectly positioned as only semi-mortal figures, working
    ""magic"" with our hearts and souls-- or worse, the cult of celebrity claims
    their bodies entirely, elevating what was probably a humbling creative
    experience into the work of gods.  And while that pays excellent tribute
    to the mysticism of inspiration, it probably distances the artists from
    the rest of the pack (i.e., us) more than necessary.

    Bob Drake plays distant music (literally, from the south of France), but
    apparently takes no pleasure in abstractions that might, in the hands of
    a lesser musician, quickly alienate an audience.  An abashed fan of
    olde-thyme pompasaurs like Yes and Uriah Heep, he rarely shies away from
    extroverted splashes of sound, be they cacophonous guitar solos or wailing
    vocal harmonies.  Yet, these moments seem less like flashes-in-the-pan than
    merely broader strokes on his palette.  In fact, where you might expect his
    songs to erupt into classical arcana, his underlying forms appear to be
    closer to traditional folk, albeit murder ballads and nursery tale night
    beasts.  It's almost as if Drake's relentless attention to detail and
    humility, even when obscured by a few layers of feedback, keeps whatever
    pretensions he has in check.
13 Songs and a Thing is Drake's fifth solo record, and continues in a
    similarly eclectic vein as last year's excellent The Skull Mailbox and Other
    Horrors.  However, where that album was a song-cycle of short stories,
    13 Songs doesn't have a running narrative to tie it together.  Fans
    of his work shouldn't be disappointed, though, as per usual, there is no
    mistaking his sound.  The opener ""Chase"", written by Dominic Frontiere (theme
    composer for the 60s horror show The Outer Limits) and arranged by Drake,
    would actually fit well on the last album, as its frenzied, claustrophobic
    terror is hammered home via an aggressive acoustic guitar jag and nervous
    violin.  It's a junk symphony that would make as much sense coming from Tom
    Waits as Danny Elfman.  Similarly, ""Ten for a Dime"" uses intricate guitar
    figures and bowed double bass to create an atmosphere not far from an Alfred
    Hitchcock soundtrack, yet Drake's later juxtaposition of strange bluegrass
    riffs and Mellotron-soaked goth place it in a realm of his own design.

    Acoustic textures lend understated warmth to most of this music, as do the
    omnipresent trad-American folk references.  The fractured waltz ""In Case the
    Insulator Fails"" could almost be an outtake from O Brother, Where Art Thou
    were it not for the offhandedly dissonant asides from violin and electric
    guitar.  It leads into the brief ""Griffin"", which is musically akin to Bela
    Bartok's take on The Beatles' ""I've Just Seen a Face"", but detailing Drake's
    erotic fascination with a museum statue places it well outside either folk-pop
    or modern classical music.

    The most striking moments on 13 Songs come when comparisons are much
    harder to make.  ""And the Sun"" is a gorgeous piece featuring distant classical
    piano and a barely audible gauze of ambient noise, punctuated by random bursts
    of radio static.  It's an almost perfect realization of almost forgotten
    mental imagery, as if years of life and music have obscured the original
    beauty of the piano music-- and in fact, Drake notes that part of the piece
    was recorded in the early 80s.  Guest vocalist Dick Verdult carries both
    ""Foam I"" and ""Rtuuf"" with throaty Spanish, and lends the former tune elegance
    not far removed from Paul Simon's buoyant work on Graceland.  Of course,
    Drake throws in a cavernous echo and expansive, almost overburdened arrangement
    of deep bass and primal, thudding percussion to knock it off center.  And then
    there's ""Building with Bones"", aka ""A Thing"": an epic backbreaker that sounds
    pretty close to the ground beneath my house caving in for about 13 straight
    minutes.

    Despite repeated demonstrations of idiosyncrasy and an apparent dedication to
    turning left when a right is expected, 13 Songs is hardly an exclusive
    experience.  I'd argue that Drake might even be approaching a hybrid of folk
    and avant-garde music that includes the most engaging characteristics of both
    without ever really betraying one for the other.  Maybe that leaves him alone
    in music circles (though I might make similar claims for the aforementioned
    Simon and Waits), but should be all the easier to pick his brand of noise from
    a crowd for listeners.  Sometimes it doesn't pay to look for links to the
    outside world, and his tunes are inviting enough that it may never occur to
    you to do so anyway."
14515	1132	"Too often in the (still) geeky-white-kid-dominated indie world, rhythm gets cast aside as a marginal
    sidekick to ambitions such as writing the perfect melody or scoring an NME-abetted college radio
    chart-topper.  Dancepunk tried valiantly to remedy this but, in a way, only made things worse: Musicians
    who seemed to have little or no interest in a groove took a crash course in ESG and sought to control
    rhythm's basic tenets because it was the thing to do.  As a result, the image of the awkward white kid
    sloppily banging out a rigid disco beat on a shitty drumset is now more farcical than endearing, and the
    fun of records like The Rapture's Echoes has been overshadowed by pale imitators.  It's nice, then,
    that Codename: Dustsucker, built from the ground up on ""found drumming"" from ex-band member Mark
    Simnett and new tracks from Talk Talk's Lee Harris, thrives on and reveres rhythm rather than merely
    tinkering with or flat-out ignoring it.
Dustsucker arrives a decade after Bark Psychosis' previous album, Hex, and the band's
    subsequent dissolution.  That 10-year hiatus may seem slight in a year in which Brian Wilson fans were
    relieved of their 37-year wait for Smile but, like the former Beach Boy, Bark Psychosis deliver.
    And, like Hex, Dustsucker sounds utterly unique, eschewing even the broadest classification.

    This album is percussion-centric, and that's to say nothing of the temperance and agility of the drummers'
    playing.  It's also an album smitten with texture, space, and silence, a seamless blend of acoustic
    instrumentation and electronic processing on which its piecemeal compositions generate massive momentum
    within predominantly slothful tempos.  On ""Shapeshifting"", one can hear a constant push-and-pull between
    the acoustic and electronic elements, as plaintive strummed guitar nudges against a stiff drumbeat with
    metallic, Gamelan-like flourishes.

    The record is also filled with huge, billowing clouds of resonance, which occasionally inundate its tracks
    in a morass of sustained sounds. ""400 Winters"" lingers and lingers, drawn out by massive amounts of reverb,
    plenty of held notes, and an ethereal underpinning of backward-looped vibraphone.  Though melancholic, the
    song is ultimately too hopeful to be dragged down and it's easier to bask in its hazy formlessness than
    moan about its lack of variation.  But while ""400 Winters"" manages to stay afloat, some tracks suffer from
    lethargy.  ""Inqb8tr"" is opulently adorned in multiple layers of effects and textures, but is too congested
    to endure its eight-minute runtime.

    But even when Dustsucker's songwriting falters, the percussion is distinct, lending direction to
    the record's stacked orchestration.  ""Reserve Shot Gunman"" emerges from directionless darkness with a
    propulsive, vaguely Latin groove.  A mercurial bassline gradually annexes notes until finding a melody
    that, in lieu of vocals, provides the track both a face and a backbone.  ""From What Is Said to When It's
    Read"" incorporates huge, tympanic tom sounds as a kind of melodic element, while ""Shapeshifting"" rides an
    unflinching vamp through a two-minute coda that features no melody, only noisome sound effects and drums.
Dustsucker may be languorous and dense enough to put off those who are on edge, but even when the
    album grinds to a halt under its excessive weight the scenery is beatific.  And what the songs lack in
    structural certainty or melodic eloquence they usually make up for in the remarkable depth and vibrancy
    of their textures.  Considering the band's 10-year layoff, it's a somewhat understated return-- and one
    painted in broad strokes.  But the album's unerring intimacy implores closer looks.  In 2004, the fact
    that this record exists at all is significant, and fans of Hex should find plenty to like under
    its moody lightning."
18383	287	"I got a heart so big it could crush this town.  Really, I'm not just
    swiping a Tom Petty lyric for shits and giggles.  My heart is huge,
    knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly
    English guys with a sampler.  Speaking of which... techno music.

    Back in the day, there was Meat Beat Manifesto.  Don't get me wrong--
    there still is a Meat Beat Manifesto, but in the early '90s it was the
    only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around.  Storm the Studio
    and 99% are sheer works of genius.  I rediscovered this last week
    when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles.  There I sat in front of the
    stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on ""Tekken 3.""  Hard beats, so
    thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out
    at any moment.  Have you heard these albums?  If not, snatch them up.
    They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the
    early '90s.

    Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track.
    Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under 120
    BPM.  Everything's too fast to dance to.  Sorry if it dates me, but it's
    true.  I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at
    900 BPM to jungle music.  Arling and Cameron's latest in a string of
    American releases, All-In, has a handful of tracks like this
    but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive.  Even on the track ""We Love
    Dancing,"" the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip.
    Remember ""Milkman"" from Aphex's Richard D. James Album?  Who didn't
    bust a gut during the crazy ""I would like some milk from the milkman's
    wife's tits"" chorus?  Deaf people, of course.  Everybody else got the joke.
    ""We Love Dancing"" is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling
    four- year- olds singing the title and yelling ""Yaaaaaaaay!""  The joke is
    later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody ""We Love to Rock"" and the spacy
    ""We Love Dub.""

    I guess what I'm trying to say is that All-In is, yet isn't, a
    techno album.  ""Speeding Down the Highway-- Fastest Girl Around"" is a nice
    merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the
    godawful hijinx of the Cardigans.  ""But What About the Boys"" is a future
    gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics
    won't entail Ace of Base or Human League.  ""Get It On"" rubs itself all
    over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and
    Hammond organ.  The sprightly fun of ""Groovy"" will have you tapping your
    foot and whistling in no time flat.  Can you dance to it?  Ask a dancer.
    I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like All-In."
16770	6881	"I really don't want to compare Nate Ruth to My Bloody Valentine, but hey, what
    can you do?  As obvious as the reference seems, he doesn't give me much choice.
    Not that Ruth's music really sounds like the work of Kev Shields, but
    the aesthetic used to construct the songs is remarkably close to the one that
    created Loveless.

    See, Ruth's basic approach on Whatever It Means seems to be to start with
    a simple vocal melody, and then layer sheets of controlled guitar noise on top,
    creating an intensely dense yet penetrable texture.  This concentrated squall is
    propelled by programmed beats that just might be somewhat danceable if they
    weren't carrying the weight of such a deep roar.  Ruth deviates from this formula
    as the album reaches its midpoint, lifting the fog for some more directly accessible
    numbers, but for the first few tracks, this is what we get.  And it's a wonderful
    thing.

    The third time I listened to Whatever It Meant, I remember distinctly saying
    out loud, to an empty room, ""Man, this album is fucking weird.""  What I hadn't
    yet realized was how insidiously memorable it is.  The more I listen to it, the deeper
    it buries itself in my mind, taking hold of a different cerebral region with each spin.

    The first four songs pour from the speakers like digital molasses.  ""End Up,"" for
    example, sounds like it wanted to be a normal song at one point, but the vocals and
    trotting percussion wind up trees in a forest of sound.  ""How Truly Great You Are""
    is a drumless, eerie thicket of guitar and quietly soulful singing.  Lyrically, it's
    an excellent, sarcastic devotional to a gigantic ego and all the people that bow to
    it; musically, it's a subtle and imaginative offering that neatly toes the line between
    ambient comfort and pop accessibility.
Whatever It Meant reaches a sort of turning point after that song, moving several
    lateral steps into some sort of cabaret for the clinically depressed with ""Oversimplifying.""
    ""Lots of newfound free time I have/ Oughta teach a course in being sad/ And the
    clouds that hover overhead get taken for granted,"" sings Ruth over not much more than
    a bass and some strategically placed effects.

    ""To Forget"" and ""Kindly"" reverse the mixing principles of the first four songs, sweeping
    the noise-addled guitar parts behind the vocals and allowing the mixture of drum machine
    grooves and live percussion to flow more freely.  ""Kindly"" almost reminds me of some of
    Porcupine Tree's best material, with its understated vocals and creeping arrangement.
    Ruth sits down at the piano for ""Every Summer,"" which is about as straightforward as
    pop music gets: singer and accompaniment, with some soft-toned synth countermelodies
    and xylophone to spruce up the edges.

    The album's final third dives back into noisy territory, though it feels somewhat removed
    from the first four tracks during which the guitars are frequently so overdriven that the
    strumming and harmony becomes somewhat ambiguous.  ""Code Words"" is almost reminiscent of
    the shoegazer punk of Italian Flag-era Prolapse, minus the male/female vocal attack
    of that band.  The transition is smooth, though, as Ruth seems to have had sequencing in
    mind when making the album.  The song opens with a very odd repeated piano phrase that
    immediately throws you off the trail of whatever key the song might be in, something that's
    not aided by the distorted everything that comes in shortly afterward.

    ""Thanks Just the Same"" is a gorgeous ballad filled with floating piano figures, dejected
    vocals, and yep, tons more distortion.  The guitar loses prominence as the song progresses,
    setting up the off-kilter ""Nothing Can Make Me Feel Better,"" which opens relatively clean
    over some drunken piano before the static undertow and frantically busy drum program cut in.
    The album closes with ""It's Been Worth the Wait,"" and you're likely to agree, because it's
    the most majestic track on the album, weaving synth and distorted guitar (of course) into a
    quilt of pure sound and bringing the album full circle to the sound that opens it.

    One thing I love to do with records that feel this complete is try to divide them into
    logical, equal sections, and I find that it's usually possible on some level.  Whatever
    It Meant follows what I've found to be a broad trend of breaking works into thirds to
    make them more digestible.  You've got the noisy/melodic first-third, the relatively clean,
    more sonically varied second-third, and the noisy/melodic/this-time-with-piano final third,
    complete with a nod back to the beginning at the end.  It sounds simple, but it's this kind
    of logical flow that makes this album a breeze to listen to, despite its often challenging
    mix.
Whatever It Meant is an intriguing solo debut for an artist who's obviously not afraid
    to try something different.  Aside from his sonic adventurousness, though, he's also got an
    innate pop sense to balance it with, and that's what really makes it work.  This album is a
    world of sound, and it's got the hooks to drag you right into it.  Give it a try."
16407	977	"Despite the plural name and a short list of session players, The Bruces
    begin and end with one Alex McManus, a seasoned veteran of the indie scene
    who has played with Empire State, Lambchop, Vic Chesnutt, and Bright Eyes.
    The War of the Bruces isn't his debut, but it might as well be: several
    years ago, he pressed a mere 500 copies of his first record, Hialeah Pink.
    He's shown ironclad reluctance to put out his own music, preferring the side
    of someone else's stage to his own spotlight, so it comes as a welcome
    surprise to his tiny coterie of fans to find that he's released an album
    one can own without a prerequisite pilgrimage to Atlanta's used record
    shops.

    Anyone who hears The War of the Bruces is more than likely hearing The
    Bruces for the first time, and it's a fine introduction. Though he dips deep
    into the well of American roots music for inspiration, McManus does more
    than simply rehash folk and blues tunes with a rock 'n' roll beat. These
    songs are rarely louder than Robert Johnson, and always softer than Howlin'
    Wolf, which is a refreshing change from the pickpockets who believe the
    blues can't be played or sung too hard.

    That said, The War of the Bruces isn't really a roots record; McManus
    re-envisions his source material like a less theatrical Tom Waits, replacing
    standard twelve-bar structures with an unpredictable-- and fascinating-- sense
    of drift, allowing for almost inexhaustible possibilities.  Instruments don't
    come in at a designated times, instead floating in and out unceremoniously.
    In the other hand, this might come off as irritating freeform, the musings of
    a jam band, even while McManus' overarching ideals nudge songs forward surely
    as Mark Twain guided Huck and Jim down the Mississippi.

    Furthering this analogy, The War of the Bruces is a taut, spontaneous
    adventure, rather than some labored, self-conscious contrivance.  Nowhere is
    this better represented than its final stretch, where each song flows
    unnoticed into the next, with ominous noise rising up to threaten the
    strained tranquility of a seamless suite. Even without his other
    accomplishments, this is exhilarating stuff, a promising younger brother
    of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

    Yet, alluring as it may be, The War of the Bruces certainly won't
    attain the dizzying critical popularity of Wilco's recent triumph, for a few
    regrettable reasons. First, McManus' voice sometimes borders on a warble,
    wavering too much for popular tastes. His lyrics are also spotty, and
    occasionally-- but very noticeably-- transpose vulgarity and sincerity.
    Lastly-- and this is an injustice-- the album's sparse, unstructured feel
    will turn off listeners who demand overt song structures. The running order
    raises that hurdle higher, sequencing the album's least effective experiments
    before its last-lap sprint to glory.  Still, for those with an open mind and
    a modicum of patience, there's much to love about this mysterious record."
12262	9296	"Boom or ruin. The meaning of ""post-war"" changes depending on whether or not
    your side won. The term is likely to keep its basically positive connotation
    in the U.S. at least until everyone who remembers the late-1940s is dead.
    I'm unsure what war M. Ward is referring to in the title of his fifth album,
    or even if he had a specific war in mind, but a time of active war seems
    like an odd time to consider the sentiment. The reality of human nature also
    means that every post-war is also a pre-war-- every generation spills blood
    sooner or later.
    The title track sheds a bit of light on where Ward's mind is, and that's to
    say he's right about where he usually is. Ward's post-war is internal,
    relational; it's adjusting to new realities, both pleasant and not. Backed
    with electric piano and shaker-- a sort of slow-motion r&b setting-- Ward's
    endearingly creaky tenor softly draws the line between then and now: ""You
    say the money just ain't what it used to be/ Man how we used to tear apart
    this town/ Put a dollar into the machine and you'll remember how."" The
    humidity is so high in the arrangement that I swear my speakers got wet.
    That humidity comes and goes on Post-War, Ward's first record with a
    full-time backing band. Having the band doesn't
    fundamentally change his approach, but it does boost the immediacy of
    some of his songs. The overall flow of the album is also much more focused
    than in the past, with 12 songs and very few transitional scraps and
    mood pieces. If those little bits of ephemera carried a large part of the
    charm load on his earlier albums, they're not missed very sorely
    here-- beautifully realized songs and great musicianship have a way of making
    up for something like that.

    And these are some truly beautiful songs. Live strings spar with mellotron
    strings on ""Poison Cup"", a gorgeous and intense love song that begins, ""One
    or two won't do/ 'Cause I want it all...I hope you know what I'm thinkin'
    of/ I want all of your love."" The song leaves Ward's familiar intimacy behind
    for timpanis and grandeur, but he doesn't shed a drop of emotion in the
    transition. ""Requiem"" storms in with raw blues picking, and from there
    twists Ward's most-visited theme-- loss-- into an unusually triumphant tribute
    to a man who ""stormed with his feet and clapped with his hands/ (And)
    summoned all of his joy when he laughed.""  ""In war he was a tiger/ And in
    peace he was a dove"" is just one of the dualities Ward gives his character
    in the kind of obituary anyone would love to have written about him.

    Ward nearly equals the shear majesty of My Morning Jacket's ""Golden"" on
    ""Chinese Translation"", which features MMJ's Jim James on backing vocals. The
    song's ""what do you do with the pieces of a broken heart"" refrain and
    acoustic/electric guitar duel hit home like hammers. The cover of Daniel
    Johnston's ""To Go Home"", with Neko Case handling the harmonies, is amazing,
    musically reminiscent of Wilco at their Summerteeth/Yankee Hotel Foxtrot peak. Not everything
    is so substantial. ""Magic Trick"" is essentially a quick joke about a girl
    whose only trick is disappearing, while ""Neptune's Net"" is a fun but
    inconsequential surf instrumental (strangely, it doesn't sound out of
    place).

    Changing his approach has rewarded M. Ward pretty handsomely on Post-War.
    The Transfiguration of Vincent is still my favorite Ward album by a
    hair, but this one
    isn't going far from my player for long. Post-War isn't perfect, but it's
    all the more listenable for that fact.
    "
1444	21222	"Ryan Lee West felt moved to a brief outburst back in August. The Leicester-born, London-based producer who makes music as Rival Consoles tweeted in protest of the ongoing boom of deep house, asking artists to quit contributing to the genre, currently in vogue. ""There's probably enough to last us till 2089,"" he wrote.West's ire makes sense, if only because the music he makes as Rival Consoles feels diametrically opposed to the luxuriant, lengthy bath evoked by deep house. West is a musical engineer in the mold of luminaries like Aphex Twin and relative newcomers like Dave Harrington, and the soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, Howl, are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening. You're always aware that any given composition is morphing, is in flux. Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere. But Howl is impossible to ignore, and hard to forget.That's partly because West so often feels comfortable disrupting his own patterns. ""Afterglow"" seems as if it's going to build on an early synth loop, but what at first seems like the track's foundation turns out to be its foyer: halfway in, and suddenly we're in an entirely new room, one that's louder, brighter, more expansive. Our understanding of his pieces broadens as they move through time, so that once they're nearly over we apprehend the entire structure as if by a drone camera hovering above.That vivid view is studded with allusions: the title track makes extraordinary reference to trains and tunnels, and at times the dusky track ""Pre"" recalls the snaking sounds of a film projector. West has said that he's a fan of ""sloppy things and rough things happening in music,"" but even the little blips and isotopes here feel as if they've been cast in concrete, accidents granted purpose. In contrast to the last two Rival Consoles LPs, Howl was largely forged from hardware (as opposed to digital technology), and the record's analogue origins would be obvious even if you knew nothing about its genesis.West is a labelmate of Nils Frahm and, this year alone, has toured with Clark and Nosaj Thing. He shares with all three the instincts of a classical composer. Howl's closer, ""Looming"", is a six-and-a-half-minute mini-epic that reflects the depth of emotion that West says he poured into Howl. But the catharsis it induces comes as much from the musician's restraint and sense of composure as anything else. What isn't there is as important as what is.West's grumbling about deep house might make him seem like a dinosaur. But he doesn't seem bothered by its existence; he's complaining about a surplus, and, like a true progressive, his momentary gripe stands as mere prelude to more concerted action. His music—rocky, spiky, warm, titanic—drives us to re-evaluate whether referring to someone as a dinosaur might not be quite as pejorative as we thought."
8554	13502	"What a bizarrely tardy project, this remix comp. The original 45:33, James Murphy's contribution to Nike's intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise, is edging up on being three years old. In Internet-era time, the DFA might as well have let these producers loose on original Giorgio Moroder demos.Not that 45:33 itself sounds dated, already owing so much to classic disco and techno. Like all LCD releases, 45:33 was Murphy acting as curator of his local dance music historical society, while thrillingly (at its best) filtering it through his own mix of mordancy and guarded euphoria. Lest we forget, it contained an embryonic version of LCD's ""Someone Great"", sans vocals, making it more or less the debut of Murphy's more tender side, something that bloomed gorgeously on the following year's Sound of Silver.But remix comps are generally rush-to-market affairs crassly designed to capitalize on a hot release by extending its commercial value for a few more months. The presumably long gestation time of 45:33 Remixes might make you think we're getting something really special, something that took time to get just right. In reality, not so much. 45:33 Remixes is more-or-less superfluous, the depressingly common fate of the bulk of remix comps. Of the eight remixers, no less than five fix on the exact same section of the original 45:33, which starts around 18 minutes in and dissolves into brass gurgles 10 minutes later. Given that the remixers had 45 minutes worth of music to rebuild from the ground up, leaning on the most traditionally ""disco"" section of 45:33, complete with horns and diva, and leaving it mostly intact feels like a failure of nerve and/or imagination.Brooklyn duo Runaway add watery keyboard stabs that blow arrhythmically against the main beat, as if they were playing an Arthur Russell demo on top of the original. Akwardly. Prince Language throws on some dub wobble, but you've got to A/B the two versions closely to even gauge what he's added or subtracted, the ""playing with the levels"" school of remixing at its blandest.And Theo Parrish, who you'd assume could at least be relied on to add some soul-funk grit to the proceedings, comes momentarily correct with boogie bass and extra percussion. But for a guy who could squeeze so much emotion out of the minimal materials of the ruthlessly raw, repetitive ""Ugly Edits"" series, Parrish's remix blands out over its seven-plus minutes, despite being 10 times more overstuffed. Hey, another Walter Gibbons-aping breakdown with call-and-response drums reverbed to hell and back. It might not seem so deadeningly familiar if it rivaled Gibbons' own best work.Of the four, only Riley Reinhold does anything remotely interesting with that 10-minute slab of downtown-NYC-in-the-1970s retro. His big innovation is replacing the 4/4 disco swish with a rigid electro-breakbeat shuffle. Even given how generic and/or tentative the other three remixes sound, you can't exactly call Reinhold's remix revelatory.That leaves four remixers to try and make up for the creativity deficit. And they're good, though not one wows enough to obviate the cost of the whole collection. Prins Thomas takes the original's most feathery section, the cascade of Tangerine Dream-ish synths and wordless vocals that make up the long outro, and turns in pop ambient by adding a micro-syncopated pulse. Trus'Me's electro is the set's most playful and unexpected track, especially when it closes with twinkling mallets that could be kissing cousin to the kind you used to get on Tortoise or Nobukazu Takemura records.Padded Cell's the only remixer who thought, ""Hey, maybe I can patch different sections of the original together to make something that extends the vibe, rather than adding congas and calling it a day."" (A seriously missed opportunity on everyone else's part.) He takes the outro coos that also beguiled Thomas and adds the lugubrious piano house that serves as the original's warmup. And surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly together, each adding to the other's preexisting sad dreaminess for the best remix here.What 45:33 Remixes lacks most is personality, something even LCD's experimental one-offs (like the original 45:33) reliably offer. See: Pilooski's deep house pastiche. Yes, it sounds nothing like the original. It just sounds like... a deep house pastiche. It's not just that the remixes dilute Murphy's inimitable presence in his own music; 45:33 was mostly vocal-free to begin with. It's that the remixers don't add much of themselves to compensate, preferring to subtly tweak sections of the original to make them more dancefloor friendly or shove them through familiar schtick.That's the charitable view, at least. A sadder take might be that the artists were just cashing a much-needed check, whether it was cut three weeks or three years after 45:33 hit iTunes. Or worse, they blanched at the freedom to dismantle Murphy's creation to satisfy their own idiosyncratic wants, their hesitancy all the more strange considering that LCD's whole M.O., what makes the band more than a sterile realization of the gag at the heart of ""Losing My Edge"", is Murphy's willingness to bend or break history to make room for himself."
14983	3019	"True experimentalists never die, they just alienate all their friends by refusing to settle into a     comfortable rut.  German legends Faust, represented on this collaboration with New Jersey hip-hop     mavericks Dälek as Werner ""Zappi"" Diermaier, Hans Joachim Irmler, Steven W. Lobdel, Lars Paukstaff and     Michael Stoll, have fashioned a pretty unbelievable catalog of tunes from a stubborn insistence on     constant movement.  Granted, they haven't always moved at the same breathless pace they did in the     early 70s, but like their krautrocking peers in Can, Faust have proved to be among the most reliably     forward-thinking musicians of their generation.Small surprise, then, to hear their glorious, droned-out take on hip-hop with Dälek.  Derbe Respect,     Alder (or ""crude respect, elder"") hardly sounds like any hip-hop I've heard; more like a druggy,     clamorous collage of industrial noise and feedback, with a stray loop every now and then.  Rather than     simply using Faust as their backing band, the trio of Dälek (Will Brooks), producer Oktopus (Alap Momin)     and turntablist Still (Hsi-Chang Lin) attack fragments and panic-ridden, acid-damaged jams as raw     source material, and opt to spout Last Poets-style free form verse over the more unhinged moments.  And     like The Last Poets, Dälek's agenda seems politically charged, as titles like ""Bullets Need Violence""     indicate.  Still, pure sound rules this collaboration, and they produce an intimidating, blunt jab     indeed.Most of the music on Derbe Respect, Alder was recorded in 2002 and 2003 by Faust, then manipulated     by Dälek-- though the final (listed) track ""T-Electronique"" was taken from Faust's 1999 album Ravvivando.     I had first heard the track on the last Wire Tapper compilation, and it is, by some measure, the     most straightforward piece on the album.  Its bass-heavy, loping drum loop flails like cold, machine-generated     funk, but the heavenly organ clusters overhead are pristine and sweet, and could only have come from Germany.     Brooks references ""filthy tongues slowly severed"" and ""the constant threat that we easily forget,"" and aligns     himself perfectly with the claustrophobic paranoia of the track.  This version of ""T-Electronique"" should     be a godsend to anyone into hypnotic drone-funk.""Imagine What We Started"" begins the album with cold wind and deep, unidentifiable bass tones, like stepping     into an endless underground tunnel and realizing all the fleeting noises behind and above aren't just products     of your ketamine buzz.  When the drums hit, all hell breaks loose: Oktopus and Still drench the loop with     delay so that Diermaier's drums sound like the work of three men hammering out polyrhythms best suited for     inducing motion sickness and hearing loss, yet it's fascinating in its disorientating force (which is     one way to describe my feeling for the album in general).  ""Hungry for Now"" introduces Brooks' voice for     the first time on the album, warning, ""If I have not met your expectations, try to conceive my frustrations     with an earthly tongue,"" over ever-offcenter drum/bass vamping from Diermaier and Stoll, while Lobdell's     guitar stains all available space with guitar drone and feedback approaching white noise.  See also the     second half of ""Dead Lies"" and grotesque motorik of ""Collected Twighlight"" for more apocalyptic dream-shriek.Derbe Respect, Alder is a tough record to size up: On one hand, its middle third can get so dense,     so unrelentingly bleak that it takes a particularly receptive thrillseeker to make it through unscathed;     on the other, its best moments (for example, the first and last tracks, not counting the brief hidden track)     are some of the best music I've heard this year, and their payoffs are reason enough to let the undertow     swallow you whole.  Regardless, Faust and Dälek demonstrate the capabilities of potent, creative minds and     insistent forging ahead of born experimentalists.  If that means a few people are left behind, all the     better to take in the hardcore bliss on your own."
1518	21166	"As a solo rapper, Big Boi has been pushing steadily against the old preconception that he was the less-daring half of Outkast. On all three of his solo albums—Speakerboxxx counts— he happily explored his quirks, establishing himself as someone more than just Andre 3000's more stolid counterpart. With Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,  he pulled off an incredible, boisterously funky reintroduction. Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors paired him with Wavves, Little Dragon and Phantogram among others, and if the results were mixed, it was further evidence of Antwan Patton's voracious ear.Vicious Lies paved the way for this full Phantogram collaboration. The indie-pop duo featured on three of the songs on Vicious, but on Big Grams they hit a bit more of a stride. This isn't a Big Boi-on-Phantogram beats project, and Phantogram's Sarah Barthel is nearly as central as the OutKast rapper as a lead vocalist. The two trade spots as lead vocalists playfully and Barthel's hooks are integral throughout. Barthel tries some rapping, and the results aren't actively embarrassing. ""Run for Your Life"", the lead track, is sparse and spacey, and the synth sounds lifted from Stevie Wonder's Moog on ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"". Big Boi's raps aren't deep on Big Grams, but they are captivating: His strategically fluttering drawl, doled out in pitter-patter bursts, is a trademark as recognizable as it is versatile. On ""Fell in the Sun"" he punches quickly with a staccato: ""I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back / I bust the sunroof open, beams hit the Braves cap.""  This track, the lead single, is the obvious standout, and it's here that the collaboration clicks fully. Phantogram's Josh Carter builds up a throbbing wall of synths atop a snappy drum loop, and like elsewhere, horn stabs punctuates: proof, perhaps, that everything Big Boi does deserves a little funk. ""Put It On Her"" is one of two tracks on the outing not produced by Carter, and it's certainly the better and more natural of them. (That soulful pump fake of an intro turns out to be a subtle 9th Wonder calling card.) The Skrillex-featuring ""Drum Machine"", however, sticks out like a sore thumb and bogs down the end of the album. For a record that's so smoothly collaborative elsewhere, ""Drum Machine"" sounds contrived and clunky. Luckily it is tacked on the end, making it entirely skippable.The Run the Jewels feature on ""Born to Shine"" fares better, and not just because of Big Boi's pivotal role in Killer Mike's career. Mike's verse steals the show—""Ric Flair'in' / Long fur coat wearin' / Rolex rockin' / Silk shirt wearin'""—while Big Boi happily takes a backseat. This may be a hallmark of Patton's career:  He's continually building up evidence that he doesn't care so much about being the lead as he is interested in being in the middle of something new and different. Given Atlanta's persistent vitality as a hotbed for innovative hip-hop, it's nice to know that one of the city's elder statesmen is off doing his own thing, carving out another little path for himself long after he helped pave the main road."
3209	19156	"When it comes to fucking around, Duck Sauce are not fucking around. Armand Van Helden and A-Trak have spent a large part of this decade acting as big-box dance music's merry pranksters, following their clown-nosed muses to the most illogically comical endpoints. In their music videos, the duo have acted as whistle-prone barbers, drank each other's milkshakes, and become literal dickheads; after bringing their bomber jacket-befitted inflatable mascot to New York City's Governor's Ball festival in 2012, they set their creation floating down the East River during the following year's installment of the festival—just for laughs.While introducing Duck Sauce's loopy entry in BBC's Essential Mix series, Armand Van Helden described the originals-heavy portion of the two-hour mix as ""songs we tried shopping to George Michael, Celine Dion, Billy Joel, and were all declined""; loaded with stoner-friendly sampledelia, the end result resembled something the Avalanches would've whipped up if they binged on breakfast burritos and after-hours basic cable.""There’s nothing serious about Duck Sauce—nothing,"" said A-Trak (real name Alain Macklovitch) when I interviewed him and Van Helden earlier this year. The project has indeed come across as a lackadaisical concern for the two veteran producers, releasing roughly a single a year over the past six years and devoting the rest of their shared effort to crowd-pleasing live performances on the festival circuit. The pair liken their biggest hit to date, the giddily repetitive ""Barbra Streisand"", to the Champs' ""Tequila Song""—""Just a riff and a word""—and to this point Duck Sauce have come across as a novelty concern, a singles project that excels at penetrating the zeitgeist.Which is fine; dance music thrives as a singles-focused culture, and even with the current micro-boom in artist-focused albums as a byproduct of the EDM money pit, smart money was not on the guys with the inflatable duck releasing a satisfying full-length. So the punchline to Duck Sauce's greatest prank yet is that they've gone ahead and done exactly that. Quack, Duck Sauce's proper debut, is reverential to the music of A-Trak and Van Helden's past—disco's ecstatic glide, house music's hedonistic heartbeat, the good-natured irreverence of classic hip-hop—while sounding totally refreshing amongst its contemporaries. The closest thing here to what some would refer to as ""EDM"" is the squeaky Dutch house of ""It's You"", which rests its central melody on, of all things, a sped-up sample of a goddamn doo-wop song.If Daft Punk's Random Access Memories found the robots paying tribute to the music that shaped their lives, then Quack is Duck Sauce paying tribute to Daft Punk themselves, along with other French Touch luminaries like Alan Braxe, Fred Falke, and Etienne de Crécy. A-Trak and Van Helden liberally apply the glowing synths and filter-heavy textures of those Gallic auteurs throughout Quack, the entire thing brushed with the type of stupid-smart goofiness not seen since Fatboy Slim's big-beat heyday. Bemoan festival-ready dance music as you wish, but the genre's greatest malady in 2014 is that many of its practitioners sound like they're trying too hard to have fun; Duck Sauce bring the party without breaking a sweat.Expertly playing to its creators' strengths—Van Helden's ability to hardwire hip-hop breaks and house motifs, A-Trak's turntablist skill and crate-digging know-how—Quack operates at one intense speed and never lets up, from the heavy thump that kicks open ""Chariots of the Gods"" to ""Time Waits for No-One""'s stadium-minded '80s rock fixations. Subtlety is non-existent. The secret to Quack's success, then, is how loud it isn't: the record is mastered with finesse, an impressive studio sheen that wraps even the most hard-hitting of A-Trak and Van Helden's creations in a down comforter. Disco-pop auteurs Chromeo pitch in on various tasks throughout the album—vocalist Dave Macklovitch, brother of Alain, sings lead on ""Everyone"" under the goofball alias Teddy Toothpick—and Quack frequently bears the type of big-money studio wizardry that the perpetually underestimated Chromeo are known for.At 54 minutes long, Quack isn't completely user-friendly as a front-to-back listening experience (shave two minutes off of every song and you'd have a tighter album that nonetheless would lose its functionality as a collection of DJ tools) but A-Trak and Van Helden deploy a few tricks to avoid inducing listener fatigue. Once or twice, they veer close to repetition for repetition's sake—the vocal drops and cyclical strings of ""Charlie Chazz & Rappin Ralph"" wear out their welcome halfway into the tune's five-minute length—but elsewhere they exhibit an impressive sense of patience. Leaning hard on samples from THP Orchestra's ""Good to Me"", the hook on ""Goody Two Shoes"" is almost impossibly indulgent to the point where it risks inducing diabetic shock; Duck Sauce know this, tempering the song's initial burst with a placid midsection of hand drums and lazer synths before bringing back the chorus in a way that triggers an intoxicating release. Even ""Barbra Streisand"", placed in the midst of Quack's world-beating final third, ebbs and flows with added flourishes (check the steel drum-sounding tones less than a minute in) to avoid reaching peak monotonousness.The other ace up Quack's sleeve is its skits. I know, I know—skits on albums are rarely funny, and their success more often than not relies on the listener's sense of humor, and everyone's definition of what's ""funny"" is as specific as snowflake architecture. Regardless, A-Trak and Van Helden, along with a cast of wiseguys that range from viral comedian the Fat Jew to Lord Sear from radio DJs Stretch & Bobbito's classic NYC hip-hop show, are pretty good at busting your gut, providing that your gut has a high tolerance for quacking noises and jokes about smelly underwear. They send up comparison-obsessed music nerds (""It’s sort of Mel Gibson meets ancient aliens""), Spanish-language radio shows, and Wu-Tang Clan's classic torture skit from ""Method Man"", the latter in which a pitched-down A-Trak and Van Helden promise to ""Take you to a yoga ashram and shit, in fuckin’ Toronto."" A few skits on Quack (the Fat Jew's prank phone call to a Chinese restaurant at the end of ""Ring Me"", the club-and-concert-calendar radio-promo spoof tacked on to ""NRG"") will undoubtedly trigger nostalgic reactions from anyone who's spent the majority of their lives in the tri-state area that surrounds New York City, and that's the point. A-Trak and Van Helden are both NYC denizens—the latter's legacy is practically cemented as one of many who shaped and added vibrancy to the city's dance culture—and even if they don't quite hit the heights of the A-Trak-name-checked influence of Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique (how could they, let alone anyone?), they've created a hedonistic, piston-pumping album that bears as much relation to the urban hustle-and-bustle as it does to festival crowds' surging, ecstatic mindsets, a love letter to NYC that sounds good just about anywhere you're likely to hear it."
3001	19408	Two opinions that could just about pass for facts upon the arrival of Klaxons’ third LP Love Frequency: 1. For many people, particularly in America, hearing the name “Klaxons” immediately opens a time warp back to the DayGlo nights of 2007, when terms like “nu-rave” and “blog-house” were spoken with straight faces and a lack of impunity. 2. It is 2014 now, and Klaxons have made a new album that, quite frankly, is pretty darn boring. However, the second fact is not a direct result of the first—this is correlation, not causation, and even if the terminology and fashion of “nu-rave” hasn’t aged well, its mission to present the 24 hour party plan of rave within a rock band context is as old as rave itself. Besides, Justice still packs 'em in, Simian Mobile Disco has become a bankable live act, and who knows, maybe something good will come of the New Young Pony Club rebranding. So Love Frequency's failures aren’t derived from a lack of currency, but rather a lack of identity.And that’s an odd issue to have with Klaxons, who put a lot of effort into establishing their previous guise, affixing the prolix lyrics and dubious mysticism of prog onto taut, glowstick-waving pop songs. It proved surprisingly malleable as they made a nu-rave-to-nu-metal transition from their electro-shocked debut to the Ross Robinson-produced Surfing the Void. It’s understandable they’d want to expand: after all, both Myths of the Near Future and Surfing the Void were enjoyable, but also top-heavy and ephemeral. Yet, while Jamie Reynolds alludes to a biblical vision quest on “Rhythm of Life”, the Klaxons return from their 40 days and 40 nights in exile (or, more, accurately, four years) having taken on perhaps the single-most common form of non-American dance-rock hybrids: that of “Don’t Fight It, Feel It” shamanism. The song titles could pass for Madchester Successories—“Children of the Sun”, “A New Reality”, “Invisible Forces”, “There is No Other Time”. Just by scanning the tracklist, you know what to expect.Beyond the lack of imagination, Love Frequency is a baggy record regardless of which definition you prefer, whether it’s hearkening to “Loose Fit” or just the way their previously punchy hooks have been swapped out for paunchy beats. Synthesized drums bang with almost no variation for up to five minutes at a time, an introductory chorus explains the song’s title before shifting to a custodial, time-killing verse—and then it returns in time to remind you which song is “Show Me a Miracle” and which one is “Invisible Forces”. It’s pointless to quote the lyrics at length, not because they’re ridiculous, but because they’re not ridiculous enough to generate the kind of conviction you need to pull this stuff off. Reynolds sings, “We’re the masters of distraction/ In a time of hyperaction” on “A New Reality”, and it's unclear as to whether Klaxons want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, or whether they have any idea of what they’re trying to get across.Though a coterie of name producers were involved here—Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands, James Murphy, and Erol Alkan—their contributions are imperceptible here without the credits at hand. You could wager a guess by way of the songs' individual tempos and when the rhythms are cranked, Love Frequency is at least enjoyable in a functional way. And maybe functionality and depersonalization is the endgame. Klaxons aspire for elemental sentiments by using elemental imagery—qualities available to everyone and belonging to nobody, not the least of all Klaxons. The sawtoothed synths on opener “A New Reality” and the curious Earth, Wind & Fire harmonies throughout are brief allusions to the fact that you are listening to a Klaxons album and not any number of E-popping revivalists. Otherwise, there’s barely any trace of Klaxons on Love Frequency, and that's a strange complaint when the best songs here are the ones where the band come closest to disappearing completely, as on instrumental “Liquid Light” and the muted, distant shuffle of “The Dreamers”.  Love Frequency isn’t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste Klaxons aren’t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore. At its worst, it’s the kind of hi-BPM, lo-IQ, alt-electro inanities that are responsible for filling the lineup of KROQ's Weenie Roast and will make you seriously reconsider your position on Coldplay and Avicii’s “A Sky Full of Stars”.  For the most part, Klaxons spend most of their time in between, a frequency stuck between stations.
274	22450	"Whether they’re parlaying their carefully cultivated mystique into pop stardom, or just outed by the press, camera-shy buzz acts generally don’t stay anonymous for long. But the masked members of GOAT have now made it to their third album without breaking character or being doxxed, which is no small achievement for a self-mythologizing entity in the age of oversharing. And even if they’re the only ones still recounting their incredulous origin story with a straight face (or a mask depicting a straight face), GOAT are still clinging the conceit, and to this day, interviews with the band put journalists in the awkward position of picking up the phone and asking to speak with somebody named Fuzzmaster.And yet in GOAT’s case, the ridiculous high-concept package ultimately reinforces the sincerity with which they approach their pan-cultural psych-funk fusion. Unlike fellow Swedes Ghost—whose campy black-mass theatrics seem like an awful lot of effort for what’s essentially melodic ’80s pop-metal—there’s very little ironic distance between GOAT’s image and execution. For them, costumery is not a means of drawing attention to themselves but deflecting it back onto their collectivist music. If GOAT aren’t actually a small-town sect reinterpreting the ritualistic sounds of the ancients (and are really just crate-diggers with robust internet connections and unlimited budgets for Afrobeat imports), what’s important is that they genuinely resemble one. On Requiem, that narrative becomes further entrenched, as GOAT lure us deeper into the woods for a communion ceremony under moonlight. This is their Zeppelin III move, a psychedelia rendered primarily with acoustic elements, pastoral brushes, and field-recording ambience. But even in stripped-down mode, GOAT are unrepentant maximalists, and the full weight of the ensemble is always felt. They’ve dialed down the volume, but not the frantic exuberance. On the joyous Afropop of “Trouble In the Streets” and the mandolin-powered raga “Try My Robe,” the band’s female mouthpiece blares as loudly as she did on past acid-rock ragers, while the chirpy flute-folk of “Union of Sun and Moon” and “I Sing in Silence” do little to temper the band’s innate sense of groove.But while there’s a greater emphasis here on compact songcraft (“Alarms” could be a brown-acid Mamas and the Papas), GOAT are still at their most transfixing when they engage in rhythmic hypnotherapy. Requiem is a double album, granting the band the real estate to stretch out more than usual and, at times, you wish they’d go even further: the thundering “Temple Rhythms” teases the connection between campfire drum circles and piano-house raves, though it fades out before the band can properly build upon its vibrating foundation. However, with the self-referential “Goatband” and “Goatfuzz,” Requiem erects its towering tentpole tracks: The former is a mesmerizing jangle jam where GOAT’s wah-wahed shredding dissolves into a textural haze; the latter is a rare moment of amped-up aggression whose electric-boogie breaks imagine Grand Funk Railroad riffing on ""Yoo Doo Right.""Despite their mosaic of international influences, GOAT are, at heart, a classic-rock band in pagan clothing. Even at their busiest, the group rarely veer toward confrontational chaos, and despite their sinister appearance, their lyrics are incense-scented, hippy-dippy platitudes (at times excessively so—this band has no compunction about giving its ballads names like “Psychedelic Lover”). But if you’re wondering how long GOAT can keep up the cult-rock gambit, well, there’s evidence here to suggest GOAT are pondering that very question, too.  Requiem’s penultimate track is an instrumental titled “Goodbye,” which could very well just signal the album’s end, however, the sense of finality is compounded by the fact the song sounds like the Doors’ “The End” given an Indo-funk remix. It’s followed by the closing curio “Ubuntu,” which reveals that GOAT haven’t just copped their sense of rhythm from African funk records, but their way of life as well. Atop free-form organ doodles, we hear recordings of men and women from the continent explaining the titular philosophy of connectedness and sharing, their sanguine sentiments (“I’m not human without your being present”) folded into GOAT’s own communal ethos through a distant flashback of “Diarabi,” the first song on the band’s first album, World Music. It’s the sort of full-circle move that suggests the closing of a chapter—but even if GOAT’s faces remain a mystery, with Requiem, they’ve at least showed us a bit more of their heart.   "
4081	18289	"The curious mind of Hans-Joachim Roedelius continues to wander. His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent krautrock obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. Roedelius is a founding member of Cluster and Harmonia, and made a handful of recordings with Brian Eno in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of Roedelius' Wikipedia page is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely matchup with English singer-songwriter Lloyd Cole. But Roedelius has already moved on from there, returning to Bureau B for this collaboration with To Rococo Rot/Kreidler musician Stefan Schneider. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on Roedelius's console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like Roedelius is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. Schneider's not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; To Rococo Rot are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit the Pastels. Still, Tiden isn't a great leap for either musician, with Roedelius providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and Schneider simply credited with contributing ""Elektronik"". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. ""Toast"" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by Schneider.This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to Tiden that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with Cole. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled ""Mild"". When they don’t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.On Tiden it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution Mouse on Mars made to Stereolab's Dots and Loops. There's an amusingly titled track called ""Indie Woogie"" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. Where Dots and Loops reeked of optimism, on ""Indie Woogie"" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time."

    Picture the most over-the-top clique of art connoisseurs conversing outside a cafe in Williamsburg, then imagine a soundtrack to said conversation. Congratulations, your brain's just imagineered Our Way Is Revenge, the debut from the Brooklyn-based hodgepodge Shock Cinema. Essentially the product of some intricate networking-- drummer Miyuki Furtado (Rogers Sisters) tours with Katrina Ford (Celebration), Ford recruits him a guitarist and singer, TV on the Radio's David Sitek takes them under his wing, etc.-- the group totes a copious catalog of influences (both musical and non-musical) into this pithy 28-minute EP.
    Considering their eclectic shout-outs to David Lynch, Can, Ennio Morricone, and other high-minded luminaries, Shock Cinema's music fits snugly in the post-punk niche, the six tracks and two remixes providing few chances for anti-ingenue frontlady Destiny Montague to elude Karen O/Vanessa Hay/Siouxsie Sioux comparisons. The rest of the band follows suit, crafting tinny, echo-laden backing all within the confines of CBGB's safety restrictions, never blowing the roof off with any one riff or cymbal crash but adequately filling out the venue nonetheless.
    In modest doses, the pretentiousness and mimicry doesn't mean squat. Opener ""Breathe Again"" coasts on an ultra-cool surf guitar riff lifted from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Fever to Tell, but as the track disintegrates into ruckus and Montague's imagery of bodily harm comes to the foreground, you can hear echoes of a twisted Kim Gordon-led Sonic Youth number rather than stockpiled post-punk tropes. The three-piece garage assault boils over on ""Death in Texas"", perhaps the track where the presence of Trail of Dead bassist Danny Wood is most apparent. Although most of Revenge beats the chromatic scales and loud-soft dynamics to death, ""Texas"" doesn't relegate its riffs to the status of glorified vamps, a lesson the stagnant ""Aftr Hrs"" and ""Howling Door (Evasion)"" should jot down.

    The album's more sluggish tracks, along with the slapdash pro-am remixes, compromise the fireworks provided by Revenge's more volatile songs. I understand the band refusing to fall rank and file behind the YYYs or Be Your Own Pet, but slowing things down painfully exposes their art-rock pablum. Unlike the Long Blondes or Love Is All, bands with similar post-punk/new wave aims yet broader palettes, Shock Cinema lack both the biting wit and endearing tenderness to complement their cerebral, misanthropic post-punk trappings. ""Art of Noir"", sung entirely in French, registers as something mildly charming and/or sexy, but its repetitive, back-and-forth raga has been done better by more stripped-down acts like Spoon, and the souped-up Giovanni Marks remix finds the track even less engaging on the dancefloor.

    Ironically, the lack of anything remotely shocking is Shock Cinema's Achilles heel. No one's getting points docked off the bat anymore for shameless soundalikes, but you still need to reflect your influences from a new, interesting angle. Considering how quickly this disparate group of musicians assembled, there's still loads of potential here waiting to be tapped, and Revenge comes packed with more than enough avenues for the band to journey down. Until then, though, this band's merely relaxing under the massive shade of their touchstones.

8500	13574	"In a recent interview, Massive Attack's Daddy G claimed dubstepper Burial might remix the entire forthcoming Massive Attack album the same way Mad Professor remixed Protection on No Protection a decade and a half ago. That's a great look for Massive Attack; Burial's moody skitter-fog should mesh beautifully with Massive Attack's heady creep. But if the teaser EP Splitting the Atom is any indication, that Burial remix joint will probably make a better and more convincing Massive Attack album than the next actual Massive Attack album.That's not really a surprise. In the past 18 years, Massive Attack have released only four albums. And the last of those, 2003's 100th Window, was the first album of theirs to fully fade into wallpaper when you weren't paying very close attention. Since then, they've busied themselves with stuff like the score to the fairly badass Jet Li flick Unleashed, seemingly giving up on recapturing the power they once had. Back when they were pretty much inventing trip-hop, the group built bruised hellscapes out of whatever they could find: dusty rap breakbeats, film-score orchestral stabs, creeped-out 2-Tone skank. They knew just when to drop something unexpected into the mix, like the downtuned metal guitar that always raised goosebumps on ""Angel"". But on 100th Window, they stopped building tracks, letting the grooves just sit there instead. And despite the deeply impressive roster of guest vocalists on Splitting the Atom, they're still stuck in that rut-- and, just as alarmingly, so are their remixers.Splitting the Atom has four tracks: two new originals, and two remixes of new songs we've yet to hear. The title track uses the deep mutters of 3D and Daddy G and the angelic, quavery croon of reggae vet and longtime collaborator Horace Andy. The track has all the elements of the group's classic sound: funhouse organs, ""Ghost Town"" echo-rattles, organ drone, voices that just flutter in the background without ever quite revealing themselves. The lyrics evoke a slow apocalypse: ""It never stops and we'll never learn/ No hope without dope and the jobless return."" But the song's drum-track is clumsy and pedestrian, and the song doesn't move toward anything; it just plods quietly along for five minutes. ""Pray for Rain"" recruits TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe to growl stony, disconnected imagery over a sprawling, expansive groove. In its seven minutes, the song does hint at something bigger, but after the cool little Aphex Twin bleeps come in, it just doubles back to its slow beginning, repeating the whole first verse over again. These days, Adebimpe's regular producer, Dave Sitek, is way better at these nervously monolithic jams.The two remixes, meanwhile, both seem content to sloppily imitate the Knife without really indicating that the songs underneath all the spooky vocoders are worthy of attention. Elbow's Guy Garvey's mewls are barely audible on the Van Rivers and the Subliminal Kid remix of ""Bulletproof Love"", and onetime Tricky muse Martina Topley-Bird growls through filters on the Flash treatment of ""Psyche"". The Knife are a good blueprint for haunted synth tracks, and the version of ""Psyche"" might be the heaviest thing here, but it sounds nothing like Massive Attack. Maybe these original tracks will make more of an impact on the actual album, but I can't see how.With last year's Third, Bristol contemporaries Portishead proved that trip-hop old heads can still make damaged masterpieces that rival anything they ever did. But Portishead did it by leaping way beyond their old sound, not repeating their tricks and hoping they'll tickle the same buttons. If the next Massive Attack album is to mean anything, it'll need to do way more than play connect-the-dots with big-name collaborators-- it'll need to tap into something primal."
6569	15513	"Punk rock has had its share of ambitious bands producing ambitious records-- Double Nickels on the Dime, Zen Arcade, Sandinista!, and The Shape of Punk to Come spring to mind-- but few groups in this sphere have pushed the envelope as often as Fucked Up. For the last few years, they've been releasing singles as part of a series based on the Chinese Zodiac, each of which usually runs over the 10-minute mark. For a 2007 charity Christmas single, they managed to get James Murphy, Nelly Furtado, and ""Degrassi: the Next Generation""/""90210"" actress Shenae Grimes (among many, many others) to appear on the same song; during a 12-hour (!) NYC concert in 2008, they got moshers to smash along to Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig doing Descendents covers. Their reach continues unabated on their new album, David Comes to Life, a 78-minute rock opera.The story of David Comes to Life is fairly complicated and, at points, heavily meta. It concerns a factory worker named David Eliade who falls in love with a woman named Veronica Boisson. They conspire to build a bomb together and death, destruction, and redemption follow; along the way, the story's narrator does battle with David for control of the plot. There's a long tradition of rock concept albums that aren't easy to understand, and this one is no exception; but enjoying it doesn't depend on decoding the tale. The record is divided into four separate acts, with a narrative focus that shifts from scene to scene-- a few songs are told from the overarching narrator's perspective, while David's ex-girlfriend, Vivian Benson, offers her side of the story in the album's back half. While a few guest vocalists are employed to help out-- Cults' Madeline Follin and singer/songwriter Jennifer Castle represent Veronica and Vivian, respectively-- the story is largely told by the band's screaming frontman, Damien Abraham, aka Pink Eyes. Taking into account the album's relatively limited range-- almost an hour and a half of straight-up bashing and riffage, with moments like the jangly acoustic figure that opens ""A Slanted Tone"" as a rare respite-- it becomes apparent that you will need a few listens and a lyric sheet to apprehend David Comes to Life's ambition and follow its labyrinthine storyline.Or, you could just sit back and let the record's dense, visceral blast of guitar squall wash over you. More than any single Fucked Up record, David Comes to Life is thick with walls of noisy melody. It's hard to get a handle on just how many guitar tracks are on a given song, and Shane Stoneback deserves a medal for mixing the sheer bulk of the sound into something so clear. But for all the shoegazey textures and blistering sonic assault, David Comes to Life is also direct and immediate. Hooks are piled on top of hooks, bursting through torrents of spacey noise (""I Was There"") and peppy rhythms (""The Recursive Girl"") alike. At points, the primal appeal of the blunt and effective riffing even brings to mind the bar-band rock of the Hold Steady.Out front, Abraham still retains his scorched-earth bark. He's been finding ways to broaden his voice's impact, and it's never sounded better than it does here. Abraham knows his range and limitations and is finding new ways to work within them while adjusting to the band's forward lurch, in effect becoming another instrument in the mix. His stomping melancholia on ""Turn the Season"" feels like a gut-check, while he follows up his sole quiet moment on album closer ""Lights Go Up"" by shouting amidst curled screams, ""I'm still in love with you/ After all of this time!"" Besides the aforementioned appearances by Follin and Castle, Kurt Vile delivers a typically slack backing vocal on ""Lights Go Up"", too-- but, really, this is The Pink Eyes Show, and it's never been so compelling to watch.That said, all the howling and the album's extreme length might be a tough thing for those new to Fucked Up. For people in this category, it might be best to check out Hidden World first; it's a good representation of how fun and hooky Fucked Up are when they're in the zone, and in many ways it's a simpler, spiritual precursor to this record. Regardless, David Comes to Life is absolutely worth the commitment, a convincing demonstration of what can happen when a band works without limitations."
15210	4150	"...And you will know them by their long, purposefully unwieldy moniker.  Or perhaps you will know them
    because Spoon's Britt Daniel produced their debut EP.  Either way, the five guys who constitute Austin's
    I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness (including a couple past members of Windsor for the Derby and Paul
    Newman) are obviously adept at cultivating attention-- and it turns out that they actually merit some, too,
    if this five-song starter kit is any indication.

    Daniel may be the big name on this marquee, but his presence is basically incidental, as he does his best
    to naturally capture the band doing their thing; reverb is about the most drastic addition he makes.
    Initially, listening to the band just do their thing without any attendant bells and whistles threatens
    overwhelming boredom-- they've strangely sequenced the absolute least engaging song at the beginning the
    EP.  ""We're Still the Weaker Sex"" isn't a bad song, per se, but if Nelson had opened with a bow shot like
    this he probably would have lost at Trafalgar.  The vocals are buried under clean, start/stop electric
    guitars, and though the music builds nicely as the drums pick up on the guitar rhythms and the band slides
    into a slippery faux-jazz groove, the melody never really builds with it, and the song fails to stick as a
    result, though the acceleration for the spiraling guitar outro is pretty exhilarating.

    Thankfully, it's nothing but broadsides of tightly constructed, Factory-brand indie rock, and soon enough,
    your battleship is sunk by the slow build and nagging guitars of ""The Less You See"", a Slint-lite swoon
    that climaxes with an airy bridge instead of a blistering pileup.  The band hold their aces for the last
    two spots on the disc, though, unloading with the spiky disco stomp of ""When You Go Out"" on track four and
    proving why we should be paying attention.  The detached, everyman harmonies sink into the band's best
    melody while the guitars scour the stratosphere with insistently droning lines that seem to ricochet off
    the open hi-hats.

    Closer ""Your Worst Is the Best"" drives home the fact that the band are at their best and most memorable
    when the vocals are performed in tandem, and the chiming guitars and electric piano of the first few
    verses create a crystalline, womb-like effect.  The song dissipates into a keyboard ether, leaving behind
    thoughts of Big Things to come for the quintet.  I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness already have
    the sound of a pink and grey counterpart to Interpol's red and black, and the Spoon connection feels
    logical, given the band's penchant for pop with a bite and a new wave edge.  If they can deliver on their
    promise, we'll soon know them for a lot more than their name."
14989	6330	"Last time around, The Places set their sights on comets and quasars.  Singer/songwriter Amy Annelle tapped
    a who's who of Portland, Oregon to record The Autopilot Knows You Best, a minor masterpiece of indie
    pop where folky violin and accordions complemented the crazy-scientist sounds of shortwave static and lost
    voices.  Melodic indie pop brushed against swaying acoustic ballads, and although her low, murmuring voice
    gave it a dreamy coherence, Autopilot was also an exciting patchwork: Each track made a new discovery.

    The follow-up, finished in 2002 but not released until this month, couldn't be more different.  On Call
    It Sleep, exhaustion hangs from Annelle's voice like dust in her hair.  Each ballad sounds weary to the
    bone, not from melancholy or a nameable heartache, but like built-up fatigue: Annelle has flopped on your
    couch after ten hours of crossing dry, identical landscapes, and you can't tell if she wants to talk about
    it.

    The album runs more slowly and evenly than Autopilot, as lazy guitars scraggle over the shuffling of
    drums and upright bass, but the focus lies with Annelle and the nuances in her vocals.  She sings in a low
    voice whose undertones resonate like blowing on the neck of a beer bottle.  Intimate and unforced, she comes
    close to vanishing before your eyes: Witness how ethereally she blends into the radio static on ""Program Ten"".
    And by singing quietly, she compels, especially when she pipes up or lets the notes swell and coast, as on
    ""Ruined New Life"".

    At its best, Call It Sleep has gorgeous melodies and a clear sense for atmosphere, never overplaying
    its fragility or stifling the mood.  She refrains from big moments, except on the album's more propulsive
    finish, ""'Til the Death""-- but more typical are the sways from troubled to resolute, the shift from ""Travel
    Light""'s desolation to the steady outdoor cantina waltz of ""Clean Starts"".

    But it's also a less remarkable album than its predecessor, despite its own round of guest stars.  Members
    of The Decemberists, The Swords Project, and Death Cab for Cutie, but nobody steals the spotlight: The extra
    instrumentation they provide is subtle, from the treading-on-glass vibes to the half-drowned piano on the
    achingly delicate ""Dead Reckoning"".  Additionally, fans of Autopilot might miss the quirky variety
    and ""geek chic"" of its experimentation and science references; on her cover of The Dreamies' ""Program Ten"",
    Annelle takes some playtime with shortwaves and sampling, but it's not as ebullient as the last album's
    cover of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"".  The tone is heavy, and the decision to sequence the slowest songs
    (""What I Wouldn't Do for You"", ""Travel Light"") in succession almost stops the album.  Where The Places'
    last LP served as a pop complement to Annelle's quieter solo outings, Call It Sleep doesn't spark
    new ideas so much as shore up her work as a singer and songwriter.

    Ultimately, Call It Sleep works as a transition album-- in her career, and also in the content of
    her lyrics.  Even at its quietest, the record isn't sad so much as pensive: The ballads' reserve and the
    song titles like ""Clean Starts"", ""Travel Light"", or ""Ruined New Life"" evoke a sense of Annelle changing
    gears and deciding where to head next.  She doesn't conjure as many possibilities as before, but she hones
    in on the choices that count."
16157	1698	"Hey you.  Yeah, you, holding a copy of A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius with an Adaptation
    ticket stub for a bookmark.  You're obviously hip to the new sensation sweeping the nation: meta-fiction!
    Maurice the Meta-fiction Moose defines the genre as ""post-modern art conscious of and reveling in its own
    limitations"" and it's in full bloom everywhere from the bookstore to the Cineplex, with TV-show characters
    talking to the camera in-between.  Hell, even record reviews do it-- I crafted a densely mirrored concept
    review around this latest release from Cursive, but it turned out to be too pretentious for prime-time
    (watch for it in my forthcoming collection of short stories about famous Omahaians).

    One media form yet to be infiltrated by the gimmick of self-reference, however, is music, partly because it's
    more than a little difficult to do in a three-minute pop song, and partly because Jon Spencer ruined it for
    everybody.  But Cursive frontman Kasher is willing to give it the old college try on The Ugly Organ,
    and somehow manages to do it with a minimum of pretension while simultaneously livening up the crusted emo
    messenger bag.

    Cursive is no stranger to the concept album; their last full-length, Domestica, was a song-cycle dealing
    with the critical entropy of a dying marriage, and its warm reception seems to have motivated Kasher to stay
    in the storyteller role.  The ""plot"" of The Ugly Organ, such as it is, revolves around loose themes of
    fallout remorse and hollow sexual meandering, the latter summed up in the double meaning of the album title.
    Appropriately, then, recurring organ figures occasionally torment Kasher's protagonist mid-song, while
    recent Cursive recruit Gretta Cohn's cello grants everything the epic quality it so desperately calls for.

    The material fueled by this concept is pretty easy to spot, bearing woe-packed titles like ""The Recluse"",
    ""Driftwood"", or ""Bloody Murderer"", and aside from the occasional Diaryland line (""My ego's like my stomach/
    It keeps shitting what I feed it""), it's a solid record for those without severe emo allergies.  ""The
    Recluse"" is melancholy and full of ornate note flurries like early Joan of Arc, and the eerie ""Driftwood""
    creeps along like ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" beneath Cohn's bowed swooshes.

    An entire LP of this slumped-shoulder soul-searching would get pretty tired, however; a fact that even
    Kasher seemed to realize as he browsed back over the sad-sack lyrics he'd penned.  Enter the meta: a handful
    of songs wherein Kasher either ups the self-loathing ante by both expressing his sadness and further
    expressing his sadness about his sadness, or brilliantly anticipates the kneejerk reactions of the
    emo-phobic critical community (not here, of course, no, never!).

    Opening the album with the couplet, ""And now we proudly present/ Songs perverse and songs of lament,"" Kasher
    makes a habit of anticipating the snide commentary of his hatas and beating them to the punch.  ""Art Is Hard""
    assails his own band with the biting stab ""cut it out/ Your self inflicted pain/ Is getting too routine/ The
    crowds are catching on/ To the self-inflicted song,"" and he styles ""Butcher the Song"" ambiguously enough to
    make vain critics betcha think he's talking about them, don't we, don't we: ""I'm writing songs to entertain/
    But these people, they just want pain.""

    Wisely, Kasher also attaches these masochistic episodes to the strongest songs of the album: ""Red Handed
    Slight of Hand"" being all raw anthem like Desaparecidos without the limited understanding of the geopolitical
    landscape, and ""Art Is Hard"" using Cohn to her fullest as the rest of the band emulates her fierce bowing
    while she rips out a buzzsaw melody like a Dick Dale cello composition.  Even ""Butcher the Song"" which turns
    on a sour riff repeated ad nauseam, has a sort of, well, nauseating effect that emphasizes the self-sickened
    words.

    With the strength of the meta-emo material, plus ""The Recluse"" and ""Driftwood"", occupying the first half of
    the album, it's easy to get caught up in The Ugly Organ's bold aims.  Unfortunately, the album is too
    top-heavy to be seaworthy, the back end full of Fugazi knockoffs and half a song stretched out to ten minutes
    in a forced attempt at a showstopping finale (""Staying Alive""-- they'd be better off with a Bee Gees cover).
    The fact that Kasher, in a toe-dipping test of this meta stuff, already called himself out as a Mackaye
    acolyte on Cursive's last EP can't save the likes of ""Sierra"" and ""Gentleman Caller"" from my seen-it-all
    scorn.  Bah.

    Still, a solid side A is enough to make The Ugly Organ an emo album (gasp!) on Saddle Creek (yipes!)
    that I'm not ashamed to admit a conditional liking for.  Should Kasher decide to continue along the concept
    album path, it would perhaps do him good to study himself some Pedro the Lion-- and he might want to steer
    clear of the meta from here on out-- I hear from New York that unironic is the new ironic.  But for twenty
    minutes of The Ugly Organ, what he's got now is enough to make an idea that sounds, on paper, a
    million ways wrong and a shoo-in for Most Self-Indulgent Album of the Year work reasonably well.  Here's
    hoping he draws someone less homely than Nicholas Cage for the film version."
193	22578	For the lead single of her second album, Tove Lo chose as inspiration one of the most-circulated and least-understood literary quotes of the past decade, the “Cool Girl” monologue from Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl: “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.” People circulating this quote almost always leave out the fact that the woman delivering this soliloquy is a psychopath who will go on to rack up a body count. But why they circulate it is more telling: that in her misanthropy she’s elucidated something very real about relationships, and very bleak.Tove Lo knows a bit about bleakness and misunderstanding; she’s courted both from her first single. The bluntness of “Habits (Stay High)” ensured it’d cut through the crowd of anodyne rising pop stars but also ensured that for the next year Lo would field interviews about whether she actually lurked in sex clubs and picked up daddies on the playground. As a student of confessionalism, she knows audiences have an endless appetite for scandalous female writers, from Mary McCarthy to Cat Marnell to Fiona Apple to Britney Spears, and that they crave their honesty less than they do their imagined autobiographies, their self-destruction and bare flayed skin. As a student of pop, she knows that her industry parses women's vulnerability as empowerment, their pain as sexiness, their point as pop as usual. Lo certainly leaves herself open to misinterpretation—her Sticky Fingers-via-creepshot album art, her music’s endlessly quotable debauchery. Perhaps knowing this, she practically spells Lady Wood out: putting an explanatory interlude in the outro of “Imaginary Friend” (“I don’t know... I guess it’s kind of like a voice in my heart reminding me that there's nothing to fear”), all but defining “lady wood” on the title track, or addressing the audience on “Cool Girl”: “Now you can’t tell if I’m really ironic,” Lo sings, absolutely correctly.“Cool Girl” is equally a pop song, a delivery device for a sassy, stuttery chorus about being a cool girl. It's the line all smart music walks, and Lady Wood walks at album length. The album’s a showcase for Wolf Cousins, the Max Martin-affiliated songwriting collective that includes Lo and nearly a dozen others, including Swedish writer Ilya Salmanzadeh, Iranian producer Ali Payami and production duo the Struts. They’ve written about half the charts, but Lady Wood is as concentrated an outlet for their sound as you’ll find. But it’s equally a platform for Lo to argue, as she did on Queen of the Clouds, that the self-destructive affairs of a particular sort of woman are a subject worthy of four-part concept albums. Lady Wood is the first two parts: the high and the comedown, the party and the afterparty. The structural resemblance to the Weeknd’s EPs isn’t accidental. When Abel Tesfaye worked with the Scandinavian claque he became Lo’s direct colleague, and the debauched tableaux and nervous vocal tics of tracks like “Don’t Talk About It” and “Keep It Simple” sound almost tailor-written for him. The sound is basically the same, too: nocturnal, minor-key synthpop, less suited to dancing with tears in your eyes than waking up alone and disheveled the morning after. It’s the same sound the Wolves have worked for over a year, but in Tove as in Abel they’ve found an ideal collaborator, one who goes as dark as they do. For the most part, Lady Wood abandons the shock value of its predecessor; the title track and a couple nods to being “under the influence” are about as explicit as things get. But her ruminations and obsessions are the same: the fleeting freedom found in bad behavior; the compulsion of her women to tamp down their desires and their inability to do so; envy of the men in her misadventures, who have it easy. It’d be easy to play this as melodrama, but Lo sings most of the album without affect, so when she does emote, it counts for more: sneaking cutesy Betty Boop inflections into the backing vocals of “Cool Girl”'s chorus, belting into the void on the ballads, exclaiming “I’m gonna get hurt!” like it’s her deepest desire. That's on standout “True Disaster,” which begins as Marr-like feedback haze and turns into one of the year's best pop songs, a perfectly wrought instrument of self-laceration. (The effect’s somewhat ruined when the titular disaster reveals himself two songs later as mealy-voiced Joe Janiak, who barely sounds capable of manipulating a coffee machine, let alone a woman. This is why “True Disaster” should be a single.)That said, “True Disaster” isn't a perfect pop song. It suffers from Tove Lo’s primary weakness as a songwriter: her compulsion, at least once per track, to include a line that her Scandinavian colleagues might call “juicy” but that comes off more like a brand saying bae. At least on a track called “Lady Wood” you know what you're getting, but nothing about “True Disaster” prepares you for the line “I can't hide my feels.” Even the tracks free of such nonsense are so unrelentingly bleak and so professionally done that, at album length, they become interchangeable well-produced malaise. Yet when Lady Wood tries to go upbeat—as on “Imaginary Friend” and “WTF Love Is”—the resulting tracks are the weakest by far. The bridge to “Cool Girl” is designed to be the emotional core of the whole album, the moment Lo lets her guard down and reveals her true desires, but it just sounds like she’s emulating Sia. Proportionally, these are trivial complaints. Lady Wood is short, but Lo finds ample darkness to plumb. “Don’t Talk About It” recasts the girl squads so ubiquitous in pop culture as nihilistic cliques hazing each other into empty highs and dead-eyed selfies. “Flashes” does the same without the squad, Lo lamenting the effect on friends back home of so much mining her life for content: “When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes, what about you?” “Vibes” is deceptively chill, the supposedly lighthearted flirting of two parties with nothing between them but contempt. “What's your line, though?... Heard that before,” Lo teases, only to be negged down by Janiak. And “Keep It Simple”—befitting the title, just Lo and Cousins standout Payami—presents a scenario both hyper-specific and likely relatable: lying in bed with a rebound at some garbage hour of the night, flipping through an ex’s old sexts, feeling nothing. Payami’s synths land fast and loud like thunderclaps, and Lo pushes any impending connection or intimacy back into the dark. Then she pulls herself together for the drop, the cool girl once more.
14925	8259	"Just like that daintily wrapped, pseudo-gourmet brie stocked on the Safeway shelf near the Kraft Singles
    and shredded cheddar, Tahiti 80's creamy, dreamy delicacies are manufactured for easy export.  Xavier Boyer
    and his gang of merry Parisians embody that quintessentially Gallic combination of élan and ennui, vigor
    and boredom-- those seemingly antithetical traits the French can so easily capture with the slightest
    Gauloises-punctuated gesture or well-placed Camus quotation.  With A Piece of Sunshine, Tahiti 80
    masterfully temper their continental contradictions with tender melodrama and songs sung in surprisingly
    facile English, turning out a sophisticated, trans-Atlantic paean in the universal language of pop.
    Their third outing on Chicago's Francophilic imprint Minty Fresh finds Tahiti 80 at their most succinct and
    confident.  Here, they've trimmed the psychedelic pomp from last year's Wallpaper for the Soul to
    reveal a radiant core of impeccable songwriting and elevated arrangements.  Even in its gel-capped
    accessibility, the album remains complex and absorbing, a gorgeous, multifaceted jewel of acid-washed
    guitars, glittery horn flourishes, and frayed electronic texture.
    While Tahiti 80 are certainly beholden to the great bubblegum symphony conductors like Brian Wilson and
    Van Dyke Parks, their streamlined packaging and electronic frills also resemble FM radio champs like The
    Cardigans and The Beautiful South.  The whistled melody that bisects ""Listen""'s jangled guitar and sweeping
    Mellotron matches the sober theme of Boyer's lyrics: ""It's easy to think you are special/ Simple to find
    out after all/ You're just like anybody else/ That's all.""  The brooding ""Aftermath"" hints at anxious
    foreboding, its minor-key pedal steel and glitchy, space-rock effects hinting at some looming depression
    the song's gilded chorus keeps at bay, while the folk-funk of ""Don't Misunderstand"" segues from gentle
    acoustic strumming into a lush electronic crunch, a duality that's presented effortlessly and effectively.
    In a culture where all art is high art-- from Herbie the Love Bug and Jerry Lewis to Manu Chao and
    Daft Punk-- where Serge Gainsbourg's biggest multi-platinum hit was straightfacedly titled (translated from
    the idiomatic, idiosyncratic French) ""I Love You... Me Neither"", turning seemingly standard radio-friendly
    histrionics into pop perfection comes rather easily.  To wit: Sunshine's peak moment, the inexplicably
    titled ""Antonelli.""  At precisely three minutes, five seconds of undeniable glory, the song rises halfway
    through this underlong album and stands out like a monument.  ""Antonelli"" features Tahiti 80's brilliantly
    precise blending of diffuse pop elements: grandiose horn parts, grinding electronic bass, sonorous drums,
    echoing guitar, all wrapped up in shimmering, airtight production.  It's a soaring, fully realized
    instrumental pop anthem that wouldn't be out of place standing next to Stereolab at their most ambitious
    or The Flaming Lips at their most sober.
    When the album finally closes with ""In My Arms"", a bittersweet acoustic ballad, we're ready for a comedown.
    Even at a mere 25 minutes long (barely qualifying it as an EP in some circles) A Piece of Sunshine
    manages to pack in a stunning amount of music.  Tahiti 80 cuts off more than just a piece; they lay out
    the whole damn sunshiney pie on the table and dole out more than enough to share."
3515	18793	"Nick Drake did not lead a colorful life.  Shy, abstracted, and bad with eye contact, he shuttled quietly from boarding school to prep school to Cambridge and made few friends along the way. The most rebellious act of his youth was a note politely informing his tutor he was leaving school. His musical career was a disaster, but not a funny or entertaining one—his albums were simply ignored and audiences talked obliviously through his live gigs. He moved back home, fell into a deep depression, and one night, either by accident or on purpose, took too many pills. When he died, there was almost nothing to feel good about.This has proved a difficult predicament for the record labels charged with profiting off his legacy. The posthumous marketing of Nick Drake's music has been arduous and fitful, a decades-long attempt at setting right what everyone agreed went horribly wrong the first time. First there was 1979's overpriced Fruit Tree box, which bombed. Then came the slightly more successful 1985 best-of Heaven in a Wild Flower and 1986’s Time of No Reply,  a collection of rare and officially unreleased tracks. His cult profile rose modestly through the 90s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when “Pink Moon” famously found its way into a Cabrio commercial, that Nick Drake's fortune as a ""penniless genius"" finally received its uplifting footnote. Since then, there has been a flurry of release activity, all of it packaging the same tiny body of work spanning six years. Nick Drake is finally famous, but it took the record industry 40 years to figure out how to make it happen.It's worth revisiting this dubious history while considering Tuck Box, the latest and possibly final repackaging. Alongside his three studio albums—Five Leaves Left, Bryter Layter, and Pink Moon—this boxed set includes the 2004 compilation Made to Love Magic, (itself a barely altered repackaging of Time of No Reply) as well as Family Tree, a 2007 collection of Nick Drake's home recordings with a few short, haunting songs by his mother, the folk singer and poet Molly. There is not a single second of new or unreleased music waiting for you inside this handsomely designed object, in other words; the packaging, which replicates the wooden box that Nick Drake’s mother used to send him cakes in while he was at Marlborough College, is the sole original flourish.What Tuck Box offers, then, is simply another chance to revisit Nick Drake's short, sad story. Because Drake died in desolation and obscurity, and because his music grows more influential every year, there will never quite be a bad moment to rediscover him. His three studio albums have settled into cultural totems, albums that anyone hoping to know something about rock history buys sooner or later. Even 40-odd years later, their thumbprint remains unique, a strange and compelling mix of timeless poetic melancholy on the one hand, and cloistered, pampered schoolboy modernity on the other. They sit completely to the left of all rock music, which Drake could care less about; his version of a garage band was a group of boys at his boarding school, one of whom was the grand-nephew of John Maynard Keynes. (Their name was the Perfumed Gardeners.)Drake was influenced instead by British folk royalty like John Martyn and Bert Jansch, or Ashley Hutchings of the Fairport Convention. When he recorded his debut, 1969’s Five Leaves Left, he must have felt, at least momentarily, that he was joining their ranks. It was Hutchings who had enthusiastically approached Drake in local pub The Roundhouse, offering to pass his information along to the legendary manager Joe Boyd. Drake's entrance into the business, at least, was effortless and auspicious, and he was joined in the Sound Techniques recording studio by a few of his personal heroes. The warm, rounded upright bass playing is from Danny Thompson, a founding member of the Pentangle. Richard Thompson plays the pearly guitar leads. Listening to “Time Has Told Me”, the first song on his debut album, is to hear to what might very well be the happiest and most fulfilling moment of Nick Drake’s professional life.Even as a 20-year-old, Drake's vision for his music was strikingly assured. He was nervous, fumbling, and difficult to engage in conversation in the studio, but he knew what he wanted. He calmly insisted that Boyd and John Wood hire arranger Robert Kirby, a fellow student at Cambridge. Bewildered, they obeyed, and were rewarded with the breathtaking string chart for “Way to Blue”. With its clean lines and grave elegance, ""Way to Blue"" suggests the philosophy that would distinguish Nick Drake’s music over the years and damn it during his lifetime: in Joe Boyd’s words, it simply  “was not reaching out to you."" Drake was painfully English, and showiness wasn’t really in his nature. But profundity glowed from his music.This approach extends to his guitar playing, which was so obsessively perfect it almost escapes comprehension. You will never hear a single string buzz. It's not the sort of virtuosity that quiets a chattering crowd, but once you've attuned to the absolute silence, it quickly grows otherworldly. Even on densely packed fingerpicking runs like ""Day Is Done"", each note sits in the mix like a stone at the floor of a clear pond. He was a frighteningly flawless player, in a way that served to magnify his incorporeality: There is no surviving video of Nick Drake playing live or talking. He died in 1974, but his physicality is as remote to our modern imagination as Gustav Mahler's.His concerns were similarly otherworldly and timeless, informed by a childhood of English Romantic poets. The futility of knowing the mind of another was a persistent theme in his lyrics, which looked right past people to stars, trees, eternity. “Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?” Drake muses. “Who can know the reason for her smile?” His music viewed human behavior and its peculiarities with quizzical detachment, even when the case study is Drake himself: “So I'll leave the ways that are making me be/ What I really don't want to be,”, he sings on ""Time Has Told Me"". Sizing up the enormity of this task, examining how it might be accomplished—these were not really his philosophical concerns. They overwhelmed him or they simply didn’t interest him, but either way, they came to trip him up, as they do us all.When it was released in the fall of 1969, Five Leaves Left went unnoticed. Island Records had done it no favors. The packaging was insultingly botched; two songs—""Day Is Done” and “Way To Blue”—were switched in the tracklisting and “Three Hours” was mistakenly titled “Sundown”. But Drake was also complicit; he began his first ill-fated tour behind the faltering album, and between songs, he would tune his guitar for minutes on end to stony, uncomfortable silence. He often walked off dejected before finishing his set. He disappeared into dope smoke, a predilection that was slowly hardening into a crutch. He blew off radio sessions and interviews and slowly began retreating into himself. It was under these circumstances that he ventured back into the studio for Bryter Layter, his second full-length.Ironically, it was initially conceived as his ""up"" album, a poppy rejoinder to Five Leaves Left. Five Leaves was pastoral, written in the wooded confines of Cambridge. Layter was written in London, and was meant to reflect urbanity. It did, but only from the perspective of Drake's one bloodshot eye, peering out cautiously at the world. Over woolly saxophone on ""At the Chime of a City Clock"", he confesses ""I stay indoors beneath the floors and talk with neighbors only/ The games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely"". Over the peppy horn charts of ""Hazey Jane II"", Drake sings lightly of how it feels ""when the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning."" The city, on Bryter Layter, is one long harsh unpleasant noise occurring outside. Nothing good or stimulating seems to happen there.The music, however, is brighter—this is the Nick Drake you can hear reflected in latter-period Belle and Sebastian. He rehearsed with a band for the first time, including other members of Fairport Convention, and the result is the most fulsome studio recording he ever managed. Some of the arrangement decisions remain bewildering—the gospel backup vocals, jazz-comping guitar and noodling piano crowding the space on ""Poor Boy"" remain as jarring now as they were when the album was released. On ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky"", Drake worked with John Cale, and you can hear a more natural dynamic in their collaboration. It's either a shame or a relief they didn't work together longer: ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky""are the two most affecting songs on Bryter, but it's also likely Cale introduced Drake to heroin.On Pink Moon, Nick Drake’s final official album, there is one single overdub: the piano part drifting over the title track. The rest is just Drake, his pristine, eerily perfect playing, his mumbling, and silence. Bryter had also sold poorly and received near-zero notices—the most favorable review compared it to ""Classical Gas"". By now, he hardly spoke to anyone; in between takes, John Wood remembers, Drake betrayed neither pleasure or displeasure. He simply sat. Keith Morris, the photographer who shot the album's photography, remarked that working with Drake was ""like working with still life."" The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When Drake was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.A ""pink moon"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""Pink Moon"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in Pink Moon, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and Pink Moon is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.The eleven songs on Pink Moon were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. Joe Boyd recalls that Drake, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""Black Eyed Dog"", ""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Tow the Line"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""Black Eyed Dog"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.The most consequential material on Made to Love Magic remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory “Clothes of Sand” and the odd, jaunty “Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of Five Leaves Left; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  Family Tree, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.Family Tree doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of Bob Dylan's ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""Cocaine Blues"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier Nick Drake than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.Family Tree also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""Poor Mum"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""Poor Boy""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""Do You Ever Remember"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""This was Nick Drake's existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer Joe Boyd for his failed career on ""Hanging on a Star"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy."
15285	423	"Most people seem to hold a fundamental aversion to making a pure spectacle of themselves.  It's a fact I
    find dispiriting, yet quite the rule: Save an opportunity to score a few second's face time on the latest
    shock brand of reality television, the rewards don't justify the risk these days.  Conformity pays and
    pays well.  I take in uptown Charlotte, surveying battalions of reinforcements along Trade Street as the
    mere differentiating factors between any two brave jaywalkers are found in the silver letters of a briefcase
    monogram or the fit on a pair of pleated khakis.  There's no pageantry, no ostentation, no grandstanding--
    no damn fun.  And I'll wager now that An Albatross will never play here.  This transplanted Pennsylvanian
    is good for at least a word of warning to the band: Do not schedule us.

    This banker's paradise couldn't host any of Philadelphia-bred An Albatross' wildly off kilter expositions
    of dissevered carnivalesque dementia.  Depending on when and where you catch them, you could witness
    anything from costumed sock-hopping to orgiastic food fights-- and all set to the band's sub-minute,
    licentious flurries of proletariat dance metal intoxication.
We Are the Lazer Viking, the band's sophomore effort, captures eleven songs in about eight minutes.
    Ranging in length between :21 and 1:24, these brief tracks spotlight vocalist Edward B. Geida III shrieking
    his way through volatile bursts of digital meltdown and pure metalthrashing.  New to the band is a second
    keyboard player, which serves to clean up the sound a bit; his oddly inviting Farfisa melodies form the
    bedrock of most of the album, surfacing even when you don't have time enough to bob your head but twice.

    The highlight might be the 1:13 of ""The Revolutionary Politics of Dance"", and (1:24 later) the :42 of ""Get
    Faster, Cry for Happy"".  Both songs blend electric grindcore bursts and wavelike synth-lulls into supremely
    rhythmic bouts of delirium.  Of the three instrumental tracks, ""J7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j"" sounds like a peek
    at the broiled labor of a steel-factory, while closer ""W7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7"" is cartoonish enough to feel
    at home on a Max Tundra album.  Oh, brave Vikings of the North, your apocalyptic unrest is valiant.  Though
    I suppose the live show of foreboding destruction is the real An Albatross experience; the record doesn't
    satisfy.  If you live in a real city, though, consider this a warning."

    The cover of Throw Me the Statue's debut album, Moonbeams, features a topless swimmer arced
    in mid-air, turning a fall into a graceful dive.
    Taken by Norwegian photographer Heidi Johansen, the
    image has the feel of an unstaged vacation souvenir: There's a boat in the
    background, a towel draped loosely around another woman's head, and a big toe
    intruding into the lower-left hand corner. It's well chosen: The casual
    composition and playful flash of nudity say quite a bit about the music
    contained therein, despite not including the name of the band or the title of
    the album. Moonbeams is a collection
    of loosely staged fuzz-pop songs about travel and sexual treachery, possessing
    a lens flare of regret even as they portray the singer-- or at least his
    first-person counterpart in these songs-- as a ""lusty"" soul living from one hook-up
    to another.
    Throw Me the Statue is the clunky pseudonym for Scott
    Reitherman, who
    plays almost every instrument on Moonbeams
    and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian.
    He introduces opener ""Young Sensualists"" with a brief overture of bright synths,
    then fades into darker, droning chords for his tale of a beach-set love
    triangle. The simple plucked strings, programmed beat, and melodic guitar solo
    give the impression of one guy turning himself into a band. And yet, just as
    the title hints at youthful self-mythologizing, the vacation details suggest
    that the inspiration came not from a postcard tacked to a bedroom wall, but seemingly
    from real experience.
    The rest of Moonbeams
    bolsters that impression. Reitherman comes across as far too social-- and far
    too well-traveled-- for such a solitary pursuit; as the cover art suggests,
    he's too worldly and musically curious to shut himself in. Moonbeams features a small backing band and a revolving roster of
    guests, including multi-instrumentalist/producer Casey Foubert, who has worked
    with Pedro the Lion and Sufjan Stevens. There are horns on ""Groundswell"",
    samples on ""Yucatan Gold"", and what sounds like an ambient accordion on the
    title track. Occasionally Throw Me the Statue's musical range seems like an end
    in itself, as if eclectica were its own genre, but generally Reitherman's
    range highlights his hooks and wordplay.

    ""About to Walk"" begins with a static-crusted pong beat
    before Reitherman launches into a vocal melody that has him reaching into his
    upper range. ""Yucatan Gold"", another tale of a vacation dalliance, begins with
    a syncopated percussion sample that nods to Latin American music, but as the
    other instruments enter, all that remains of it is the cowbell, twitching on
    offbeats. ""She's a crazy animal when she screams,"" Reitherman sings. Overly
    dramatic and more than a little self-satisfied, it's a silly refrain-- an
    indie-pop nod to Girls Gone Wild.

    Following the ""juvie malaise"" of ""A Mutinous Dream"" and the
    hopped-up horn section of stand-out ""Groundswell"", the Hallmark imagery and
    funereal trumpet on the title track sounds too pedestrian, even for a song
    about his dead grandfather (well, especially for a song about his dead
    grandfather). Sure, it leads Reitherman to realize he'll be dead a hundred
    years from now, but that's a well-worn idea. Moonbeams is best when it is least sentimental, when Reitherman's
    antihero coldly accounts for his own actions and confusions. Fortunately, the
    album doesn't end with Reitherman flipping through old family photos, but with
    him softly singing ""The Happiest Man on This Plane"", a drifting acoustic valedictory
    that confuses sex with love. Again. Adding a bit of carnality to an often
    asexual genre, Throw Me the Statue's candor is compelling.

2764	19767	"Juan MacLean represents something of an archetype DFA artist: a reformed indie rocker who immersed himself in synth gadgetry and surrendered to the groove. He typifies the behind-the-scenes, slave-to-the-music vibe from which so much dance music springs, and like any great dance artist, Maclean's best work has come via his singles (""Happy House"", ""You Are My Destiny""). If James Murphy was the quarterback of the DFA roster, then Maclean was the president of the AV club.If there's any extra urgency or excitement surrounding Maclean's third studio album, In A Dream, it's that DFA now lacks a flagship act, and Nancy Whang—frequent collaborator, In A Dream cover star, justification for the definite article preceding the Juan's name—seemed to be a burgeoning creative force herself in the waning days of LCD Soundsystem. Her work on In A Dream is among her best: brassy and affecting, she sings like a punk rocker whose feet have warmed to disco but not her heart.Which is just as well: Maclean and Whang have been distilling the funk/punk out of this project since 2005's still beloved Less Than Human. To wit: within about a minute of the album's start—the cardio motorik of ""A Place Called Space""—we're treated to a searing guitar lead. What Maclean and Whang have settled on here is a more muscular, downtown version of the type of reedy disco-pop that Lindstrøm & Christabelle explored on Real Life Is No Cool. In A Dream is hi-def synth boogie, flexing and preening in ways its forbears simply couldn't, as if old Ze Records and italo-disco classics had spent the last 30 years in the gym packing on studio wherewithal and audio fidelity.When everything comes together, In A Dream is spectacular. ""I've Waited For So Long"" whips around hurriedly as Maclean and Whang trade verses and choruses. ""Running Back To You"" is a slo-mo bass gargle, with Whang's salt-corroded vocals bristling against the perfectly formed contours of the bass synth, which Maclean walks carefully on a leash for the song's duration. ""A Simple Design"" is the most compact, finest ever summation of this partnership, a simple, danceable track that finds the two dancing around each other, Whang's ""la la la""s providing ample space for Maclean's flights of fancy before she grabs the chorus by the throat and caresses it gently.Problems that have persisted throughout The Juan Maclean's output crop up here as well. Maclean is a less frequent and less irksome vocal presence than on prior records, though he's still uncompelling, pushing through the shoulda-been-anthemic peaks of ""Love Stops Here"" with affectless utterances. Maclean is a masterful synth programmer but not a singular one, and so sometimes In A Dream resembles those beautifully built urban townhouses, trading sturdiness for creativity and sapping some of the fun in the process.That's the harshest grenade you can throw at In A Dream, though: it's too comfortable and robust. When the duo come in for the requisite 10-minute, album-closing jam, it feels earned, and it's motive and charming enough not to bore. In A Dream is Maclean and Whang's most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, it cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on."
15978	4317	"I was once just like you.  At shows, I would concentrate on remaining as still as possible, allowing only
    a tapping foot or nodding head to express any enthusiasm I had for the performer.  When confronted with
    commercial radio, I would sneer and mime symptoms of illness, bemoaning the factory-produced facelessness
    of pop music.  My head was full of a taxonomy categorizing all artists I came across as ""authentic"" or
    ""contrived,"" as judged by their biography, label affiliation, and oh yeah, occasionally, their music.
    For years, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with this behavior, considering my musical health robust, even
    vibrant.  But after an appointment with the vaunted Dr. People, I realized I was suffering from a rare
    illness: Indie Guilt Syndrome, or IGS for short.  Though I thought my listening diet was healthily balanced,
    Dr. People diagnosed me with a serious deficiency of Vitamin F(un), which led to excessive behavorial
    inhibition during shows and caused me to miss out on hundreds of irresistibly catchy and fascinating
    songs against which I'd been prejudiced based on sales figures.  To treat this condition, the good doctor
    prescribed a revolutionary new cure: Junior Senior's D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat.
    Chances are, your only exposure to Junior Senior thus far has been the Fatboy Slim-endorsed ""Move Your Feet"",
    a track that happens to be the most stereotypically Euro on this record, layered as it is with three coats
    of rayon keyboard and a raspy diva shouting for global unity via the dance!  It's a strong club track,
    but probably a bit of a deep-end dive for tourists from the land of singer/songwriter moping and fiercely
    proud lo-fidelity.  Fortunately, the remainder of the D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat is easier to
    swallow for IGS sufferers, as Junior Senior draw their inspiration less from disco/techno clubland than
    from the classic rock dial.  ""Boy Meets Girl"", f'rinstance, combines the psych-organ groove of early
    Traffic, cowbell-banging from ""Honky Tonk Woman"", and Kool & The Gang woo-hoo!'s, while ""Shake Me Baby""
    speaks of wanting to be ""your tambourine man"" in a gleefully approximate Dylan impression.  (If either
    fails to get you off wallflower detail, your IGS may be approaching the terminal stage.)
    Sure, this duo's wacky sexual-orientation hijinx (Junior is straight, Senior is gay, and boy, they don't
    let you forget it) are a bit gimmicky, but it's not like the popular duos of the indie rock world are
    publicity stunt-free.  Plus, the backstory allows for lovably loopy songs like the raucous ""Chicks and
    Dicks"", the ""I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock 'n' Roll"" of gay/straight relations.  Brimful
    of the unbridled horniness of ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" but without the hetero constraints of Mötley Crüe,
    the song contains the humanist message that Junior Senior will fuck any and everyone.
    Lyrically, the subject matter runs the philosophical gamut from ""move yo body!"" to ""rock da house!"", but
    for every moment that triggers the cheese reflex (pretty much all of ""Shake Your Coconuts""), there's a sly
    wink.  The frantic ""White Trash"" declares, ""We wanna be like Nancy and Lee,"" a reference semi-obscure enough
    to appeal to long-time IGS sufferers.  Not that you'll care much, as you hop along to songs like ""Rhythm
    Bandits"" and ""Good Girl, Bad Boy"", each alternating between hard-beat drum-and-chant verses and explosive
    go-go cage choruses.
    Sounding as much like playful garage-rock as cocky Europop, it's telling that one can easily imagine a
    unifying DJ set playlist where The Rapture's ""I Need Your Love"" segues into ""Move Your Feet"" segues into
    Justin Timberlake's ""Rock Your Body"".  I don't mean to pressure you into the embrace of dance music--
    many people live long, productive lives with IGS-- but if you're starting to chafe at the constrictions
    of the indie lifestyle, if your feet insisted upon doing more than just tapping at that last Dismemberment
    Plan show, and if you've repeatedly caught yourself humming ""Cry Me a River"" while you Kinko's your zine,
    consider Junior Senior as treatment for Indie Guilt Syndrome.

    your physician before use.]"

 Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Music (1918-1955) is an
    enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s. The set was compiled
    by Ian Nagoski, who runs the respected True Vine record shop in
    Baltimore, Md.
    Nagoski-- a righteous bliss-drone musician whose own recorded output is
    worth hearing-- was once an intern for La Monte Young's long-running
    ""Dream House"" installation in New York. He's written about music for The Wire, and in the 1990s he was a contributing editor for the exceptional and sorely-missed 'zine Halana.
    Nagoski's been collecting 78s since he was in high school, intrepidly
    and often blindly looking for stuff that sounds cool, even if the
    labels were all in Russian and he had no idea what it was going to
    sound like. As you can guess from the title, this assemblage of material comes from
    long ago and far away, all over the globe: Syria, Thailand, Laos,
    Yugoslavia, Scotland, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, England, Turkey, and a
    dozen more.
    It's always a treat to be reminded of how much amazing music there is
    in the world that you've never heard. Seventy-five percent
    of this material has never been issued on CD, so both bushy-eyed world
    music newcomers and intrepid crate-combers will find an awful lot to
    dig in these 24 songs. In fact, only one track's ever been released on
    a CD in the States before. Black Mirror
    stacks performers of great renown (at the time) next to uncredited
    musicians performing folk musics that stretch back for centuries. All
    of them are obscure today, of course.
    Most people associate 78s with inferior sound quality. The word
    ""scratchy"" seems quite nearly wedded to the numbers ""78,"" in fact.
    However, nary a scratch, pop, or crackle is to be heard here. Great
    care has gone into transferring and mastering these tracks. And unlike a
    lot of digital processing done in the 90s (when this kind of
    technology first became affordable), it hasn't heavy-handedly lopped
    off entire frequencies in the process. Sure, there's a little
    background hiss in the back of Nino de Priego's gorgeous, flamenco-y
    ""Envidia Yo No Tengo A Nadie"", but whatever. There's far more hiss on a
    Sebadoh record.

    It's tough to say what unites these recordings, aside from the fact
    that they weren't made for export and most
    represent a tradition in danger of extinction. Highly mannered female
    vocals flutter on top of string orchestras on a few tracks, while
    there's a delightful Cameroonian rumba and ""Songs in Grief"" from Japan
    (which lives up to its name). A monk rhythmically and effortlessly
    recites a prayer for what might be the millionth time; he's devoted his
    life to this particular chant. But some other kind of glue holds all
    these pieces together: the sequencing, the way the songs
    unfold, is a large part of the pleasure here. A woozy, melted-sounding
    ""horizontal monochord"" recording from Vietnam in 1930 segues perfectly
    into a passionate recording of Handel performed on a piano in Germany
    in 1931.

    When a thing is done with absolute love, it tends to show. I'm not a
    huge fan of CDs myself; I have a lot of vinyl and more mp3s than I can
    count. But it's awfully hard to imagine these songs without
    the lovely 24-page booklet that comes with the set. The liner notes are lush with
    information about each track, as much as Nagoski could find
    anyway. He also brings the listener back to the very dawn of recorded
    sound by reproducing some of the earliest reactions to Edison's great
    invention, the phonograph. Nagoski writes with awe himself about
    finding a special, strange record in a dusty corner, and about how
    amazing it is that these round, brittle discs can transfer such
    absolute magic from one generation to another.

    There are indeed magical possibilities when it comes to assembling and
    editing a collection such as this; it's no accident that alchemical
    symbols dot Harry Smith's liner notes to his celebrated urtext, the
    three-volume Anthology of American Folk Music.
    Nagoski also quotes from his own translation of the
    spiritual-minded, avant-garde poet Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, even
    borrowing the album's title from one of his works. All that places the
    material in a different context than one usually finds in globetrotting collections of ye olde records, which often
    suffer the post-colonial hangover of exoticism. Here's to hoping that
    Nagoski compiles at least a dozen more records like it. Black Mirror just might be the most remarkable collection of its sort since Pat Conte ceased his CD reissue series Secret Museum of Mankind in 1998.

12003	9609	"Many techno/house fans have their issues with Michael Mayer, with the Kompakt cult of personality, with the whole notion of dance music that appeals to people who don't crawl out of the after-after party at two in the afternoon on a Sunday. Or if they want to get technical, they don't like his selections, which generally favor melody or texture or mood over funk. And they don't like his mixing style, which generally favors playing tracks out to their full length and little in the way of hard chops or other mix trickery. They don't like the gothic mood swings of his mixes, his taste for sharp and smelly cheese, or his fondness for trance. And, of course, someone, somewhere was doing something similar, better, earlier-- and never got the fame or the cred that Mayer enjoys.
    To which I say: fuck that. Mayer's mixes may offend deep house purists, confuse analog Detroit techno fans, or irritate ""minimal"" heads who enjoy Richie Hawtin's affinity for making super long, super boring tracks out of a million smaller super boring tracks, but he is certainly, unashamedly ""pop""-- at least within the parameters of his genre. He's kind of like the Cure: Sure, he loves to bum you out, but then he'll throw in a ""Love Cats"" now and then. On the other hand, there is no way a sequel to-- not to put too fine a point on it-- one of the best DJ mixes of all time wasn't going to be something of a disappointment. Four years and uncountable dancefloor trends and trendlettes separate this Immer from the first. And anyone looking for a continuation of Mayer's earlier mixes-- with their combination of utter corn (guest spots from Nena! Tweeting birdies!) and brooding dancefloor discontent-- will be slightly confused by the less ostentatious and dramatic Immer 2.
Immer 2 finally made sense on a drizzly, horrible fucking morning that I spent at my desk with my hungover head in my hands. Since my skull already felt like it was filled with salt water, the crackles and popping bubbles and Sea Quest pings and blips of the opening Someone Else track slowly eased me in, whereas a Jeff Mills blitz might have just sent me running for the Advil. Mayer is nothing if not a master of pacing, and there's no reason why a home-listening DJ mix can't take its sweet time.

    After the 4/4 push begins in earnest, the next four tracks feel like traditional house sloughing off all that briny water and seaweed, the skipping jazzy hi-hats and bumping basslines of tracks like Ian Simmonds' ""The Dog"" and Frank West's ""2nd Booty"" moving up from the muck and into the light of the mix's brassy disco middle. This is the biggest difference between the two Immer mixes. Whereas the first third of Immer 2 creeps and crackles with the same crepuscular 3 a.m. vibe as the first installment, it's difficult to imagine a track that samples (according to the fine folks at ILM) a Boz Scaggs disco tune-- as cheeky and lovable Justus Köhncke's ""Advance"" does here-- fitting alongside the portentous hunk of Mahler's 5th Symphony that Mayer dropped on Immer.

    The Todd Terje remix of Lindstrøm's ""Another Platform"" finds Mayer smack dab in au courant space disco territory. It's as trendy (and speedy) a move as he's ever pulled-- for a moment you might think you were listening to a Get Physical DJ. Needless to say, it's also the mix's most incongruous moment. The final third is more Mayer-esque. It climaxes with the SuperMayer remix of Geiger's ""Good Evening"", an epic trance workout, the kind of anthem you thought was out of fashion in an era of 13 minutes of tics and tocks and clicks and rustles. It's one of the most shiver-inducing singles of the year, featuring the kind of synth blasts in its first few minutes that feel as good a particularly hot and high-pressure shower nozzle. It only goes up from there.

    But the changes this time out have less to do with tempo or Mayer's apparently newfound need to boogie. The first Immer, and especially Mayer's Fabric 13 mix, had personality. Immer 2 is far less eclectic-- there's nothing here like the stuttering cut ups of Jackson's M83 mix, the portentous reversed strings of Richard Davis' ""Bring Me Closer"", the deranged shuffle of Akufen, or the vampire cotillion vibe of Phantom/Ghost's ""Perfect Lovers"". If fans want to hear this with fresh ears, I'd advise lopping off the Immer from the title, and enjoying one of the better, spacious, and inviting disco-tech mixes of the year without prejudice.

14392	7892	"As we walked idly through Midtown Manhattan this summer, my girlfriend and I came across a foam-suited SpongeBob posing for pictures with a small group of children. When the kids wandered off, we stepped up, thinking it might be fun to take a quick picture with the famously affable pineapple-dwelling milquetoast. He excitedly waved his hands, but as we moved toward him, a hulking teamster forcibly intervened, crossed his arms, and shook his head: ""We work for tips.""
    I'll be the first to admit that I don't understand the SpongeBob phenomenon. In the early 90s, animators like John K, creator of ""Ren and Stimpy"", fled the toy commercial wasteland of network TV animation and found a niche on the fledgling Nickelodeon network, whose novel idea of airing creator-based cartoons led to the successful first wave of the network's original animated programming. But as these cartoons evolved, so did their marketing practices-- the congenial ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" came with a prepackaged saturation plan. The metaphorical sweaty bodyguard of Nickelodeon promotion forcefully exerts its presence these days-- and does so in stark contrast to the show's uber-amiable wholesomeness.  However: Is SpongeBob truly a model of forgiveness and understanding, or just an adorable, inoffensive tool in Nickelodeon's merchandising arsenal?
    More importantly, how did Wilco, The Flaming Lips, The Shins, Ween, and Motörhead land on the soundtrack to the first ""SpongeBob"" film? Many of these artists have contributed to soundtracks in the past-- The Flaming Lips rode the success of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" all the way to Batman Forever, The Shins had a life-altering role in this year's Garden State, and Ween have appeared, along with Pantera (!), on a previous ""SpongeBob"" soundtrack-- but here, their original material is geared toward young children. Presumably the artists contributed to the soundtrack because they enjoy the show, or at least want to score points with their kids, but their contributions-- many of which were recorded specifically for the film-- sadly sound half-hearted.
    Avril Lavigne's presence isn't a surprise (she's the only artist whose audience might overlap with show's), although her Gap-rock take on the ""SpongeBob"" theme is pretty excruciating-- all 46 seconds of it.  The Shins might be hoping to cast their net a few demographic points below the ""O.C."" crowd, but their contribution, ""They'll Soon Discover"", comes off as self-parody. The song's cloying hook-- a lilting acoustic guitar pattern and synth melody-- is forgivable, but James Mercer's specific references to the show's characters are awkward and frustrating.  His lyrics are too verbose to be deciphered by children, yet will also not likely sit well with older fans. Concessions to a younger audience are perhaps to be expected, but The Shins' uncomfortable middle ground here does no one any favors.
    The Flaming Lips and Wilco both offer mediocre originals as well.  It's disappointing to hear the Lips' psychedelic inclinations reduced to a few grating synth lines, a weak Coyne melody, and an awkward backdrop of obtrusive bubble sound effects on ""SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy"".  Wilco's ""Just a Kid"", likewise, is a forgettable mod-ish number backed by Jeff Tweedy's eight year-old son, Spencer, and his band The Blisters.  Ween actually emerges as the Teflon contributor, in part by steering clear of the film's content altogether-- the previously released ""Ocean Man"" remains an enjoyable novelty.
    Most songs are irredeemably annoying, though, even for a children's soundtrack. Prince Paul sleepwalks through the pandering hip-hop kiddie luau ""Bubble Party"", while Motörhead's ""You Better Swim"" is a bizarrely caricatured blooze number whose sheer inexplicability (Lemmy: ""C'mon, Spongey!"") at least makes the song interesting as a curio.  Songs written specifically for the film are the biggest offenders-- the endless repetition of ""The Goofy Goober Song"" in particular should make bus drivers countrywide batshit crazy.  Fans of this soundtrack's contributors couldn't be blamed for being compelled to pick this up for the new material, but unless you've kids of your own you want to impress, you might just want to skip the embarassment altogether."
8478	13607	"It may share its name with another second city, but the third LP from the Russian Circles calls to mind a fairly famous quote from one of their hometown's favorite sons. ""Chicago is an October sort of city even in spring,"" Nelson Algren wrote, and Geneva's an October sort of album no matter when you put it on. Geneva feels very much like the city its members hang their hats: rusty and steely and shifty, overcast and a little cold, and-- Algren again-- ""battle-colored."" It evokes a long early morning's drive down the length of any one of Chicago's city-spanning north-south thoroughfares, blowing through both industrial grit and beatific parkways, eyes peeled for crumbling facades and flashes of chrome and the not-so-occasional pothole.There were signposts to Geneva all over the spiny, immediate Enter and last year's prettier, driftier Station, but on their third go, the Circles are clearing a path all for themselves. Debts are still due to genre godheads like Mogwai and Slint, for certain, but like the best work of their obvious forebears, on Geneva the Circles have found a way to make three guys in a room sound like a lot more than three guys in a room. Credit where credit's due: a great deal of Geneva's success lies in the string work of cellist Allison Chesley and violinist Susan Voelz, who add a resonant depth to many of the record's best moments, filling in the gaps around these insistent compositions with a kind of sweeping gothic grime. But even without the hired hands, Russian Circles are penning limber, purpose-driven tunes, then playing the hell out of them. And, in their structure and execution both, this is doubtless their finest work yet.Instrumental prowess is a double-edged sword in just about any genre, but when instrumental's all you do, you run the risk of the dreaded wank with every flick of the wrist. That's something the Circles in general and Brian Cook in particular have handled admirably through the years; they're capable of sneaking thunderous Lightning Bolt-style blastoffs and fingery Yngwie thingys in with opulent drift, while coming across as neither tossers or tossed-off. Drummer Dave Turncrantz gets plenty in, but favors the boom over the barrage, and guitarist Mike Sullivan, as Pitchfork's Cosmo Lee pointed out in his review of Station, often cedes the presumptive lead role for the good of the group. But it's Cook who's come into his own here on Geneva, consistently holding down the low end with inventive but unshowy aplomb. And when he's given a shot at the spotlight-- a position he takes only a handful of times throughout-- the record is his.The Circles have long done peaks far better than valleys, and there's really only one such dip on Geneva: ""Hexed All"", a tune they all but give over to Chesley and Voelz, flipping the melee of, well, ""Melee"" for a supine string-laden swoon. It's clearly meant as a respite from the relative brutality that surrounds it-- much like the first few minutes of ""Verses"" was to the middle of Station-- but it also works against the album's momentum a touch, the widescreen beauty of Explosions in the Sky reformatted to fit your screen. It's fine, but it's not necessary; the string section is so seamlessly integrated into the Circles' sound on meatier tracks like ""Fathom"", putting them front and center feels more like a conciliatory gesture than a Russian Circles tune.The record's second half favors an enveloping crumble over the opening trio's crushing hypnotism; tracks unfurl more patiently, perhaps more gracefully, but with nearly the same sense of purpose that underlies the weightier start-up. Save the proggy ""Malko"", this stuff is textbook post-rock; songs start soft and slow, more elements get thrown into the mix, and we eventually have our climax. Still, there's a sense of internal dynamics in the tunes that makes this particularly good textbook post-rock; instead of a simple gradual increase in volume, they pull in sounds from left-field, lending the tunes a ratchety, rust-covered feeling that is unusually complex. Nearly all of these tunes die screaming, they just take a bit longer to get there as Geneva goes on. It's more a matter of contrast than anything else; were the running order reversed, you'd sit on your hands through the first half waiting for the impending blowout. I suppose this, too, is like Chicago, with the livelier South Side giving way to the statelier North, both with their unique merits. Either way, Geneva's a record with dirt underneath its fingernails and resolute urgency at its heart, and like the place from which it hails, it's worth the bluster."
2557	19916	"For an album about marriage, Deptford Goth's Songs rings as lonely as breakup debris. The second LP from UK-based singer and producer Daniel Woolhouse, Songs isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't Songs of Daniel Woolhouse; you won't find a ""So Long, Marianne"" in its ranks. Instead, Songs—maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny Life After Defo—winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.I mean, how do pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? Woolhouse's Songs circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""We Symbolise"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""The Lovers"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.Behind his accented murmurs, Woolhouse fills out Songs with bolder strokes than the pale production of Life After Defo. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized— strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, Woolhouse sounds completely alone.It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. Woolhouse knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout Songs, he yearns to be better—to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""Two Hearts"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""A Shelter, a Weapon"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever."
11832	9783	"Glossy neo-psych groups have been in a
    bit of a slump lately. Patron saints Flaming Lips' 2006 outing, At War With the Mystics, couldn't muster up memorable melodies to
    match its playful production. Mercury Rev's 2005 The Secret Migration
    wouldn't even be mind-expanding in a Cold Stone Creamery. A new
    Polyphonic Spree record has been so long coming they named last year's
    stopgap EP Wait. Who knows, maybe what Nancy Reagan told us about acid
    was true.
    Well, except for the hokum about it messing up your DNA. The Earlies put
    their zany forebears' genetic blueprints to fine use on These Were the
    Earlies, the 2004 debut by the half-Manchester, half-Texas quartet.
    Culled from five previous EPs, that album found the transcontinental
    group seeking a home in the frontier between two headphones, with
    strings, synths, woodwinds, and marching-band brass. If their debut
    explored the space within, the Earlies' latest, The Enemy Chorus,
    peers into the void of the final frontier, with a similar kitchen-sink
    approach and more of the krautrock sprawl that characterized early
    singles like ""Morning Wonder"".
    The deaths and lies of the last couple of years must've gotten to
    these dudes, too. Opener and first single ""No Love in Your Heart""
    builds from lockstep motorik groove to a swirl of meandering
    harmonies, chanting, strings, and clattering percussion. Panning
    effects overtake theatrical pianos on the subsequent ""Burn the Liars"",
    which finds lead singer Brandon Carr complaining, ""Don't tell me
    life's OK/ I tell myself that."" On title track ""Enemy Chorus"", an
    Eastern-tinged melody snakes around a minimalist drone as the
    protagonist crawls past enemy lines. A bright, flange-dappled bridge
    cuts through the gloom: ""Tell me it's gonna get better.""

    The cover design, by Manchester-based artist Michael England,
    certainly suggests a futuristic enclave of joy and light amid a dark,
    bleak universe. With prominent horns and a Moon Safari string
    arrangement, ""Foundation and Earth"" opens the album's second side
    finding the Midnite Vultures sunshine funk in ""day after day."" The
    catchiest track, ""When the Wind Blows"", casts a sing-songy melody over
    stomping drums and piano, shifting into a ""Hey Jude""-informed chorus.
    Harmonicas wheeze on ""Bad Is as Bad Does"", atop backwards cymbals.
    When they work, these ambitious arrangements plausibly act out the
    cover art.

    At other times, the Earlies' seriousness casts a shadow over their
    sonic fireworks. ""If the light goes out/ The world will be dark
    again,"" Carr murmurs on sappy ""The Ground We Walk On"", slide guitar
    mired in acoustic-Braffrock arpeggios. Muted pianos and a ""Revolution 9"" collage of astronaut audio (Jets to Brazil did this better on
    ""Perfecting Loneliness"") introduce ""Little Trooper"", a somber track
    that wouldn't be out of place as a too-pristine Dream Theater ballad.

    Remember the Beta Band who, like the Earlies, launched their career
    with a record compiling early EPs. The Scottish quartet coolly
    contradicted the idea a good song is one you can rehash on ""MTV
    Unplugged"", instead focusing on the production and frills that would
    make a perfect track. The Earlies' take a similar approach, but at
    times lose their focus as the Beta Band seemed to on later
    albums. The best moments here are the instrumentals: sitar-driven
    krautrock space raga ""The Breaking Point"" and bassoon-heavy galactic
    war anthem ""Gone for the Most Part"". Our long national nightmare isn't
    quite over, but the Earlies can at least make it brighter-- and they
    don't need words to do it.

1029	21711	"Trotros are to Accra what the subway is to New York, in that neither city would function without them. On Trotro, DJ Katapila pays homage to Accra, and on its title track, he tips his hat to its infamous minibus system. From the song's outset, a cartoonish voice exclaims, ""Makola, UTC, Kaneshie!"", imitating the mates (drivers' assistants) who lean out the side of the trotros calling out their destinations. That same kind of humor and depiction of daily life runs through much of DJ Katapila's music, which is a mix of neo/traditional Ga dance music, and old-school house and techno.DJ Katapila, aka Ishmael Abbey, grew up in the '70s in the coastal district of Jamestown in Accra, a historically Ga area. The now-40-something became known for his marathon DJ sets, to the point where his tirelessness earned him the nickname ""Katapila,"" after Caterpillar construction equipment. Yet it wasn't until several years ago that he started actually producing, and in 2009, he self-released his debut album, Trotro. Since then, a number of his tracks have circulated on bootleg tapes, which is also how Awesome Tapes From Africa found his music and ended up partnering with him to issue this rerelease.The album was never actually pressed to cassette, yet it still sounds as if it were playing back through a thin layer of dust. This rawness comes in part from Katapila's own production, in part from the spirit of early Chicago house and Detroit techno, and in part from Ga music. The album is grounded as much by the four-on-the-floor thump of Chicago house as it is by the programmed son clave patterns that are common to so many genres of music across the Black Atlantic, including kpanlogo. Kpanlogo is a type of neotraditional Ga dance music that combines older sounds like gome drumming and street processional music with elements of highlife and '60s-era rock (ie the Twist). It also happens to be a precursor to azonto, whose inflections can be heard throughout Trotro. For instance, on ""Sakawa,"" the rhythm comes through in the snare, on ""Trotro"" through the handclaps, and on ""Cocoawra"" and ""Lalokat,"" very clearly in the cowbell.Besides house and azonto though, DJ Katapila also often references other kinds of contemporary, black club music, while still largely staying within the sphere of Accra life. ""Nkran Dokunu"" refers to Accra kenkey, a corn-based staple food of Ghana. The track bounces along at around 140 BPM and feels almost like a slower, crunchier shangaan electro. Midway through it, as a toy Casio-like figure plinks along over a galloping snare, two cartoon-voiced characters chant in Ga, “Accra kenkey is delicious! We’re eating it!”By contrast, ""Ice-Inc"" is a lot darker in mood. It's a direct line to old-school Detroit techno, complete with 808-sounding electrofunk cowbell, and the time-warped, intergalactic quality of a Kraftwerk song. It may not scream ""Accra""like some of the other songs on the album. But as a part of Trotro as a whole, it speaks to the multitude of musical and cultural influences that have been exported and imported to the city over time. That, and the propensity to approach the otherwise unremarkable with a remarkable sense of humor."
13920	5963	"Will Sheff sounds mad. Not angry mad, but the other mad-- nearly hysterical. On Okkervil River's fourth album, Black Sheep Boy, he oversings beyond the limits of taste and vocal cords, either belting the notes forcefully or overenunciating his syllables at quieter moments. You can even hear his agitated spittle hitting the microphone on ""For Real"". It's as if his voice is too small a vessel for the big ideas and even bigger emotions that drive the band. As Pauline Kael once wrote of Gene Wilder, Sheff ""taps a private madness,"" as if the pain and heartbreak around him-- the runaway sons, abused daughters, lost friends, damaged lovers, and doomed relationships that comprise the world of the album-- push him to caterwauling arias, his hysteria barely bottled by the demands of his carefully constructed songs. But, like Wilder, Sheff never overplays his hand and always maintains control, which, also like Wilder, makes him at once heartbreaking and somewhat humorous-- more self-aware than Conor Oberst, more serious than Colin Meloy, more legible than Jeff Mangum.
Black Sheep Boy creates a roomy and natural showcase for Sheff's high-wire vocals, and as a result, it may be the band's best album, the crest of a wave that began with 2003's Down the River of Golden Dreams and rose through a subsequent EP and two releases by sister band Shearwater. Okkervil River's major accomplishment-- what sets Black Sheep Boy farthest apart from previous efforts-- is the sense of purpose to these songs: they sound studiously literate, melodic, and concise, which bolsters their cumulative effect. A concept album that moves thematically rather than narratively, Black Sheep Boy was inspired by the Tim Hardin song of the same name and begins with a more or less faithful cover. The following 10 songs expound on these themes of prodigality and wanderlust as the band display an unflinching devotion to the sheepish title metaphor, following it all the way through until the boy becomes a ram.

    Writing in first-person, Sheff traffics not in plots, but in predicaments full of concrete details and clever wordplay. On ""Black"", a man despairs to counsel and comfort his lover, who was abducted and possibly abused as a child. ""April 12th, with nobody else around; you were outside the house...when he put you in the car,"" Sheff sings, capturing the character's boiling frustration and romantic abandon. Meanwhile, the band churns a bouncy pop energy, driven by Jonathan Meiburg's keyboards and Zachary Thomas's rubber-ball bass, which pushes and prods him along, intensifying the emotions even as it seems at tonal odds with the dark material. But, as the music makes clear, ""Black"" is a love song, a statement of determined devotion.

    The sound on Black Sheep Boy, while certainly familiar to fans, is so far removed from the purposefully lulling pace of Golden Dreams that it could belong to another band altogether. To an extent, it does: The quartet has grown into a sextet, and the expanded line-up is evident in the ambitious, intricate, yet accessible arrangements and the dramatic dynamic between the songs. ""For Real"", ""Black"", and ""The Latest Toughs"" are frenzied headlong rushes that nicely offset the quieter moments like ""A King and a Queen"" and ""In a Radio Song"". ""A Stone"" rests on a bare honky-tonk two-step shuffle, and Howard Draper's lap steel adds a flourish to ""Get Big"", a duet with Amy Annelle. Careening strings and crescendoing horns add catharsis to the eight-minute ""So Come Back, I Am Waiting"", the album's climax. ""A Glow"", though, is its dark denouement, a menacing coda to Okkervil River's most sustained and startling collection of songs yet, throughout which the band makes Sheff's private madness starkly public."
8880	13058	"Like all semi-pop survivors, UK trio Saint Etienne have settled into a warm familiarity. A deep catalog-- one that shows more refinement than reinvention over the past 10 years-- means the band's stuck with its cult. But that's actually got to be a pretty comforting idea in 2009, as any overworked young buzz band approaching onstage breakdown before album two can tell you.Still: What about when Saint Etienne was new, maybe even a potential commercial prospect? Listen to this new reissue of the band's debut album, 1991's Foxbase Alpha and you'll hear that, then as now, Saint Etienne made lovely, accessible music. But Foxbase is also far closer to capital-P pop than the band's recent refined blend of exuberance and melancholy. So why didn't I hear Saint Etienne songs like Foxbase's ""Nothing Can Stop Us"" and ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart""-- both Billboard #1s on the dance charts-- burbling from communal boomboxes in eighth grade?One theory for why Saint Et stiffed in the States is also a big part of the band's draw to many fans: The potentially limiting pleasures of Anglophilia. So yes, Foxbase is littered with odd, musty little samples from odd, musty Olde England, and beats from the highly polished dancefloors of contemporary London. In fact, Pitchfork contributor Tom Ewing once wrote a wonderful essay that suggested Foxbase was best understood as a musical embodiment of the whole vibe of late 20th-century UK living, including, but not limited to, the mix of chic, glossy multi-cultural collisions and grubby, hospitably lived-in neighborhoods that made up London itself. (A brief break to get some conflict of interest stuff out of the way: A) The aforementioned Mr. Ewing contributes an essay to the liner notes of the Foxbase reissue, and B) Saint Etienne member Bob Stanley has contributed to Pitchfork. If either of those things stick in your craw while reading the more-or-less gush that follows, well, sorry.)Another reason Saint Etienne never hit with a U.S. mass audience? While the likes of Snap! and Crystal Waters made big-budget dance records with an urbane sheen, records that would work in any capital city club around the world, Foxbase Alpha's sonics had a DIY edge, an underground-gone-mainstream bulletin from a very specific milieu. Albeit one that can still be enjoyed by anyone not predisposed to hate the soft, the sunny, the lilting, the laid-back, and the mildly twee. Foxbase is on one level a UK indie pop record with a particularly unique sound and vision-- the joys and pangs of cusp-of-adulthood love and loss, delivered with a clued-in-ingenue mix of wide-eyed enthusiasm and knowing languor by Sarah Cracknell, set to a backing stitched from the gentler side of pop history by studio whizzes Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs. It's just a unique indie pop record that happened to bump to a bright pop pulse.What's funny about bringing up the always divisive p-word is that I remember some big-name 90s dance producers actually dissing Saint Etienne by calling the band ""bubblegum."" We can assume those producers meant Saint Etienne erred too much on the indie side, sacrificing dancefloor kick. But much like the Anglophilic fantasy world the band conjures, that split allegiance is another part of Saint Etienne's specific appeal. Foxbase tracks like ""Spring"" and the cover of Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" do indeed sound like heart-on-sleeve pop kids (in the C86 sense) trying their quite adroit hands at lounge-y hip-house and piano-driven disco.But several of Foxbase's best tunes move past adding idiosyncratic touches to off-the-rack uptempo 4/4 rhythms, and into something more unique and beguiling. The drowsy, heartsick ballad ""Carnt Sleep"" sounds like a humid summer spent spinning Sarah Records 7""s back to back with Sade, slick soul secretly slid into an indie-friendly sleeve. Or there's the Cocteau Twins-ian shivers of ""London Belongs to Me"", with its smitten, multi-tracked Cracknell crooning to herself across a diamond sea of piano chords. Assured but approachable, these club-informed but not quite club-ready songs offered a wholly other kind of ""indie dance"" from the previous punk-funk generation or the cheap-and-easy preset-punching remixes of the blog-house era, something like careful cursive on pastel paper compared to blurry cut-and-paste photocopies or generic computer typeface.""Foxbase squeezes so many ""lighter side of"" sounds-- be they from the worlds of rock, dance, soul, whatever-- into one LP that it's a marvel it sounds so unified, mostly owing to Wiggs and Stanley fixing on the platonic house rhythm as the glue to hold their disparate passions together. But the second disc of bonus tracks often feels like two producers still figuring out how to make the raw materials of post-acid house their own. A grab-bag of late 80s/early 90s rave sonics-- only sometimes processed through what we know as the Saint Etienne idiom-- dates much of the material. ""Chase HQ"" and ""Speedwell"" are competent but sketchy early UK house singles, full of jittery samples and keyboard stabs. Fun, but ultimately too generic without Cracknell's voice or the sample-choice oddness and studio chops Wiggs and Stanley would bring to the band's later music. Better is the dub playground chant of ""Sally Space"", Cracknell humming ""Iko Iko"" through a quiet storm front of classic ambient house textures, the Orb with a dose of girl-pop glee.Speaking of the p-word (again): Continental, a previously Japan-only odds-and-ends collection reissued in the same batch of Saint Et records as this new Foxbase, works as a sort of mirror image of Too Young to Die, the band's almost absurdly listenable 1995 singles compilation. If the all-hits uniformity of TYTD represents Saint Etienne's final, most obvious stab at Now That's What I Call Pop immortality, then Continental is the beginning of the more wide-ranging (and hit-or-miss) restlessness that's characterized the band's records from 1998's Good Humor onward. Each track is recognizably Saint Etienne-- Cracknell's inimitable winsome-but-grown-and-sexy coo announces that, if nothing else-- but the tracks (frequently darker, often instrumental) go very different places than the uniform, bubbly house-lite of Foxbase's uptempo moments.So much so that when legit UK hit ""He's on the Phone""-- not coincidentally the only track Continental shares with Too Young to Die-- shimmers into earshot, it's such a glittering throwback to the old Saint Etienne that it nearly skews the vibe of the whole collection. ""He's on the Phone"" is Saint Et's most deliriously normal single, a go-for-broke attempt at the kind of high-test mainstream house that still appears on comps with ""Ibiza"" unironically in their titles. The rest of Continental offers another of Saint Etienne's seemingly paradoxical combos. It's far more subdued, even reflective, than Foxbase's unashamedly hooks-first buoyancy. But it's also sonically ""big"" in a way that makes it seem like a commentary on the mid-90s moment when even chill-out-centric electronic music went stadium-sized.""Burnt Out Car"" and ""Stormtrooper in Drag"" have, respectively, the kind of thick and fluffy prog-house keyboards and crashing drums you could imagine Underworld or Orbital using to whip a festival audience into a frenzy, a far cry from the ""made in your friend's flat"" scale of Foxbase. The effect of this surface-level bigness in Saint Et's hands is decidedly different, though, than in those their Glastonbury-headling contemporaries. It's the sound of the band's blithe young lovers suddenly forced to grow up as money and traditional notions of glamor infiltrate their imagined world. Even as they age, though, and club-life-as-permanent-playground gives way to club-life-as-vector-for-adult-pain, Saint Etienne's cast of characters retain an unrepentant sentimental streak, one not so much obliterated by experience as deepened by it. ""Groveley Road"" and ""Suburban Autumn Lieutenant"" exude a vibe of poignant longing that's hammy as hell-- it takes guts to include an image as blatant as ""the season has changed"" in a song about the dissipation of love-- but also wholly convincing if you go with it.While listening to these reissues during an oppressively gloomy, rain-sodden East Coast springtime, I also re-read Martin Amis' London Fields, a vision of the city as the second millennium drew to a close that's almost Foxbase's inverse: A world of venal yuppies, reprehensible con-men, and lost souls who've long since given up on love. Saint Etienne's heart-on-sleeve protagonists (and audience) were too earnest to conceivably survive a day in such an overwhelmingly beaten-down environment. The sort of ""decaying violent reality of the harsh urban etcetera"" that Mr. Ewing's essay suggests Saint Et caught shit for ""ignoring.""Equally fantastical, Amis' all-ugly-all-the-time London is also Anglophilic catnip, just the kind that tends to impress the sort of American who prefers sardonic ""we're all fucked"" loathing to idealism or nostalgia. Grossly sentimental as it may sound, though, at the moment I'll take Foxbase's imaginary year-round summer, where it's ""too warm to even hold hands"" but the rush and flush of first-love makes it too tempting to resist. There's enough doom-mongering waiting for me when I open the BBC News website every morning to not enjoy a little escapism."
14969	1676	"The devastating paradox of David Cross' pre-recorded comedy: Is it funny that everything Cross says is
    nauseatingly smug, yelped out in smarmy, supercilious prose?  Or is David Cross just a giant fucking
    asshole?

    That Cross is such an immensely unlikable live performer-- condescending, defensive, arrogant, patronizing--
    is both his greatest asset and his most crippling flaw, and it's that conflict-of-interest that makes him
    such a polarizing (and compelling) comic.  Ultimately, Cross has somehow manipulated self-satisfaction,
    the least funny of all post-collegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona, leaving it up to
    his audience to sort out their guffaws from their grimaces.  And there are always plenty of both.

    Having signed a contract with Sub Pop, liner-note-repped for The Fiery Furnaces, stunt-reviewed for
    Rolling Stone and Spin, toured with rock bands, publicly mocked Staind/Evanescence/Scott
    Stapp, and acquired a perfect pair of black, plastic-framed glasses, David Cross has inadvertently
    embedded himself in the contemporary indie scene, amassing wads of useless cred and granting hipsters
    even more reasons to be annoyingly sarcastic over cans of PBR.  It's Not Funny conceals bits of
    comic gold (on fresh fathers who complain about the trials of paternity: ""Try talking your girlfriend
    into her third consecutive abortion.  That takes finesse!  You're just inconvenienced""), but Cross'
    onstage persona, unlike the genius of Mr. Show, is also stupidly tiring, all balls-swinging
    swagger and brainy pseudo-superiority.

    Recorded in January at Washington, D.C.'s The Improv, It's Not Funny (oh, and the knee-jerk critical
    reaction to pre-emptive album titles?  It's not funny) sees Cross faced with a responsive-if-feisty crowd.
    As with 2003's Let America Laugh, Cross approaches all hecklers with genuine, undisguised disgust.
    When Cross is questioned on a bit in which he glibly suggests that dogs are smarter than women, he
    pauses briefly to ask, ""You don't believe it?  You believe that I didn't do a series of tests?  You're
    right to not believe it, because I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I do not believe what I just said.
    It is what is described as 'a joke.'""

    Cross' material has been progressively skewing towards the political, and, for better or worse, the
    post-9/11, where-we-are-now theme persists throughout most of It's Not Funny.  Some of Cross'
    terror-talk is supremely well-played, but a lot of his material also seems tired and curiously dated,
    particularly since It's Not Funny was only recorded four months ago.  Cross' fuck-off snarkiness
    may be a welcome antidote to the nauseatingly maudlin faux-sincerity perpetuated by men in public office,
    but is it still clever to snicker about the futility of the color-coded terror system?  Everyone already
    gets that announcing an ""Orange Alert"" is stupid.  Same goes for the call to secure duct tape and plastic
    sheeting from your local Home Depot.  36 episodes of Saturday Night Live later: Um, hee-haw.

    Cross, like most Americans, remembers how, in the weeks following 9/11, a big, throbbing wave of convoluted
    friend-of-friend free-associating plowed through the U.S.  Everyone immediately removed from the explicit
    devastation of Ground Zero struggled for the appropriate entranceway into earnest empathy, noting second
    cousins in Hoboken or that friend whose plane got re-routed through Ft. Lauderdale.  In some ways, that
    kind of blind, desperate grasping was perfectly understandable-- curling your fingers around one lone
    tragedy (or near-tragedy) is a lot easier to swallow than attempting to reconcile yourself to a gaping
    and anonymous mass grave.  Still, many New Yorkers (in impeccable New Yorker form) found America's
    faux-brotherhood annoying, scowling disgustedly from behind their paper surgical masks, rolling their
    eyes, and snorting at sobbing newscasters in Phoenix.  The behavior of both sides has already been
    well-explored, but Cross still opts to launch into a half-cooked skit about how employees of Vegas' New
    York New York casino may have ""felt it a little deeper.""

    Cross successfully lands some giggly barbs (riffing caustically about the sobbing overweight woman in
    Accounts Receivable, with a ""Hunky Fireman"" calendar and stack of Dilbert cartoons), but his
    over-indignant NYC pride/national irritation still reeks of Georgian transplantation.  Subsequently, it's
    hard to find his defensive posturing funny: Cross may be joking, but it's still clear that he wants to own
    the tragedy of 9/11, like all New Yorkers who spent hours re-routing their morning commutes or trying to
    forget the sound of a plane crashing into a building full of people.  The problem is that his
    plea-for-possession-masquerading-as-a-joke ends up being far too self-serious to be even a little bit
    laughable.

    Still, in the end, it's impossible not to appreciate Cross' political tirades, particularly since precious
    few independent artists seem to have the balls/gumption/awareness to tackle what is easily the most salient
    and divisive conflict of the new millennium so far.  Comedy has always been politically brazen where music
    is meek, and Cross is unrelenting: His high-speed, Michael Moore-ish indictment of the Bush administration's
    manipulation of public fear is both convincing and entertaining, while his whispered mockery of Bush's
    misappropriation of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" elicits loads of knowing sniggers.

    Anti-war proselytizing aside, Cross lobs plenty of other, equally legitimate (if disappointingly predictable)
    darts at the hypocrisies of the American government, and at the general idiocy of Creationists, racists,
    homophobes, Republicans, people with children, Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond, electric scissors, fundamentalist
    Christians, the rich, and Fox News.  It is, for the most part, standard white liberal disdain-- but sometimes
    funnier, and with lots more cursing."
7909	14149	"Sam Amidon's idea of recomposition-- of excavating Appalachian folksongs; rearranging, repurposing, and creating a dissociation that feels uniquely contemporary-- isn't exactly unprecedented. Musicians-- like A.P. Carter, who scrambled up and down Clinch Mountain in the late 1920s, collecting local songs for the Carter Family's repertoire-- have been reinventing folk songs since before we knew to call them folk songs. That's part of what folk music is, and does. What separates Amidon from the scrum of revivalists and archivists is how modern these renditions are. I See the Sign, Amidon's third folk LP, doesn't contain any original tracks, but his interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now.Amidon grew up singing folk music in Brattleboro, Vermont; his parents were members of the Word of Mouth chorus, a community choir which performed sacred harp hymns in the 1970s. Culturally, folk music is inextricably linked to the south (and Appalachia in particular), but rural Vermont has birthed its fair share of traditional strummers (pick up Margaret MacArthur's Folksongs of Vermont for an impeccable primer). Amidon inhabits these songs comfortably, with an ease that belies a childhood spent with a fiddle in one hand and a banjo in the other.Much of I See the Sign's success can be chalked up to its arrangements, which are fractured and frequently off-kilter; Amidon and his cabal of collaborators-- Nico Muhly, Ben Frost, Shahzad Ismaily-- have been merging chamber music with indie rock for awhile now (see also: Sufjan Stevens, Thomas Bartlett, Owen Pallett, Bryce and Aaron Dessner of the National), and their touch is nuanced and, on occasion, delightfully odd. Bits of percussion, distorted bursts of Moog, and hits of celesta pop up and recede, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. The arrangements are never bombastic (unlike what happens when, say, a pop artist gets paired with a philharmonic)-- instead, they're violent (the stabbing bass and scuttling percussion of opener ""Here Come That Blood"") or stiff and lonely (the restrained electric guitar and puffs of strings on ""I See the Sign""). On ""You Better Mind"", Amidon, harmonizing with Beth Orton, gets backup from threatening squeals of strings: ""You've got to give an account of the judgment, you better mind,"" they caution. Their voices are grave, concerned.As a vocalist, Amidon is preternaturally calm, and his flat repetition of certain couplets (""Found my lost sheep,"" ""Loose horse in the valley"") feels mesmeric and mantra-like. He's poised, but never cold, and I See the Sign can play like a gospel record, with all the attendant modes and lessons. These are songs to live by (or in), and these iterations-- despite their sophistication, despite his stoicism-- never feel like museum pieces or anything less than functional.The only non-traditional track here is a cover of R. Kelly's ""Relief"". On paper, the choice feels a little like a trap (R. Kelly fills an odd role for overeducated indie rockers), or at least a posture-- and while it could be didactic or a lame grasp at irony, Amidon's rendition is stunning. ""What a relief to know that/ The war is over,"" he and Orton sing, their voices earnest and tough, rising over the album's thickest, most optimistic swells. When Amidon finds an affirmation of faith-- ""What a relief to know that/ There's an angel in the sky,"" he sings, grateful-- it's hard not to feel that liberation deep down in your gut."
13260	4364	"Ceasefire is an album whose backstory threatens to overshadow its music.
    Emmanuel Jal and Abdel Gadir Salim have spent most of their lives less than
    a thousand miles from each other, but they may as well have been on
    different planets, as they fell on different sides of the front line in
    Sudan's long and brutal north-south civil war (a separate conflict from the
    current troubles in Darfur). The war pitted the Muslim, Arab, and
    comparatively wealthy north against the south, where most are
    adherents of indigenous faiths, along with a sizable Christian minority.
    Salim is an elder statesman of northern Sudanese music and a master oud
    player, while Jal was forced into duty with John Garang's rebel SPLA (Sudan
    People's Liberation Army) group before he turned eight, training in
    Ethiopian camps and fighting skirmish actions before he learned to read.

    After years of fighting and a defection to a rival rebel group, Jal was
    ultimately helped out of the country by Emma McCune, a British aid worker with
    Street Kids International, but was left as one of thousands of so-called
    Lost Boys of Sudan after her death. Schooled in Kenya and London
    with help from McCune's friends and family, Jal turned to music after
    converting to Christianity. And it seems fitting that his odder-than-fiction
    path into the world of hip-hop should find him entering the international
    stage (he's already released an album of gospel hip-hop in Kenya) on an
    album he shares with a musician from the north of Sudan, in an unprecedented pairing.
    Jal and Salim do not mix their music thoroughly on most of Ceasefire,
    instead allowing Salim's elegant desert blues-- played on oud, accordion,
    saxophone, wooden drums, and bass-- to rub up against the sequenced beats and
    funky flow of Jal, who raps in Nuer, Arabic, English, Dinka, and Kiswahili-- sometimes bouncing between four different languages in the space of one
    verse.

    It works surprisingly well, and not just because the two musicians appear on
    some of each other's tracks. What really is striking about it is how effortlessly
    Salim's organic, traditional percussion and Egyptian-influenced singing
    style fits alongside Jal's more 21st century sound. Unsurprisingly, the
    lyrics of both men reflect on the hope for lasting peace in their country (a peace
    already encroached upon by the Darfur violence). Jal opens ""Aiwa"" (Arabic
    for ""yes"") with a verse in Nuer that translates to ""I would love to sing in
    all the people's languages/ With this chance that I have I want to express/
    The whole of my heart to the whole of the world."" The chorus trades Nuer
    lines with Arabic affirmations, something that would have been next to
    impossible only a year ago.

    The vast majority of the album is not sung or rapped in a language I can
    speak, but I've always enjoyed listening to lyrics I can't
    understand. I think it removes an extra layer of baggage (Jal's evangelism
    can be heavy-handed in translations) and allows me to just concentrate on
    the pure sound of the voices, which in this case is hugely rewarding. Salim's
    singing has a clipped dryness to it as he plays his vocals against his
    wriggling oud lines and accordion merges with sax on pentatonic scales.
    Salim's contributions are tonally similar to each other, and breaking them
    up in order to place them throughout the album brings out the details in
    each of them. It likely also makes for a more interesting listen for Western
    ears used to modulations and non-diatonic chords.

    As for Jal's songs, ""Elengwen"", ""Gua"", and ""Baai"" make a monster trio of hip
    hop tracks. The first begins with a bouncing beat and a guitar/flute duel
    before Jal offers some of his most interesting verses, from a flow
    perspective. Large, mostly female backing choruses offer catchy
    interjections, coming to the fore with a jerky English-language plea for
    peace on ""Baai"". Live guitar and sax spice up the arrangements, and Salim's
    oud shows up on ""Baai"", floating through the strutting beat like a linen
    caught in a sharp wind. The song may be about the end of an appalling war,
    but it has unbelievable floor potential.

    Music obviously cannot put a wrecked nation back together, but it can be one
    of the first steps toward reconciliation, and Ceasefire succeeds beautifully
    as both that and an interesting album with potential to appeal in just about
    any corner of the world's geography. Perhaps the most impressive thing about
    it is that the music isn't overwhelmed by the history of its players and
    their country. Ceasefire is a celebration of peace that looks forward to
    better days, and that's something I think we can feel in any language."
6577	15441	"For just over two years, Washington, D.C.'s Chalk Circle were a staple in the city's early-80s punk scene, part of a group that included (but was assuredly not limited to) both Ian MacKaye and Henry Rollins (then known as Henry Garfield). But while Rollins and MacKaye built lasting legacies off the strength of their 80s work, Chalk Circle have been regulated to cult-hero status, revered by in-the-know punk fans-- including No Age's Dean Spunt, who is responsible for co-releasing this anthology on his PPM imprint.Aside from Chalk Circle's rare live performances-- they played only four shows-- their obscurity could have something to do with the way their slippery post-punk didn't fit in with the righteous (if slightly homogenous) thrashing of their peers. Don Fleming points out in the liner notes that the band had even hoped for some releases on the increasingly influential Dischord Records, but the label ultimately decided they did not fit on their roster. And while that was true for the majority of their slender output, ""The Slap"" and ""Scrambled"", with all their dissonance and half-shouted lyrics, would have made for a perfect Dischord 7"".Built around the songwriting partnership of Sharon Cheslow and Mary Green, Chalk Circle's sound fit in nicely with peers the Slits and the Raincoats, all creators of an innovative brand of post-punk. Reflection opens with its title track, and Green's introspective lyrics ensure it lives up to its name, while Cheslow's guitar dances around Tamera Lyndsay's bassline and Anne Bonafede's polyrhythmic drumming. ""My drumming was heavily inspired by the Tony DeFranco song 'Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat',"" Bonafede states in the liner notes. ""As a matter of fact, all of my drum riffs were variations of that song."" Just like the Slits and Raincoats, Chalk Circle were ahead of their time, with ""Uneasy Friend"" adopting uneasy back-and-forth vocals and a similarly jittery energy, and closer ""Subversive Pleasure"" presaging not only modern punk bands such as Mika Miko and the Coathangers, but the entire riot grrrl movement of the late 80s and early 90s.Perhaps due to her interest in poetry, Green was a pretty remarkable lyricist in a genre where words were used primarily as rocks to throw at the glass windows of the establishment. ""The Slap"" uses the image of violence against women as a metaphor for initiation into society, while ""The Look"" is an almost-satirical glance into patriarchal standards of female beauty. On ""Reflection"" and ""Easy Escapes"", Green turns the lens on herself, forging personal takes on romance and life. ""Love songs don't touch me,"" Green sings on the latter. ""But is that what I really want?""With exception of ""The Look"" and the rough mix of ""Easy Escapes"", the best work on Reflection has already been released via early-80s tape compilations. The previously unreleased five of the album's 12 songs were live tracks and basement demos, which serve more as interesting sketches than vital documents. Peppered throughout the album, they provide rough-hewn counterparts to their studio-recorded work. They're not terribly essential, but they definitely provide a deeper context to the band's history.""We wanted to have a band because we loved playing music and listening to music,"" Cheslow states in the liner notes. ""We saw girls from N.Y., L.A., San Francisco, and London playing in bands and they gave us inspiration and courage."" In 2011, the notion of an all-girl band is just as important as it ever was, primarily because we're still using the term ""all-girl band"" as if predominantly female rock groups were still a novelty of some sort. While women are unfortunately still fighting to be treated as equals-- even in the so-called ""liberal utopia"" that is underground rock music-- it becomes increasingly necessary to shed a light on the female bands that time left behind, especially ones as prescient as Chalk Circle. Reflection offers a broadly overlooked chapter in not just the history of women in American punk rock, but the history of American punk rock overall."
503	22044	On the night of November 14, 1991, 500 million people scattered across 27 nations simultaneously watched Michael Jackson grab his crotch 17 times. He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to “chill out, homeboy.” It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox.The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of “Black or White” ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of ’90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the ’92 VMAs, the premiere of “Summertime” after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the ’96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it’s difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again.This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading “Welcome Home, Michael.” His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips.The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What’s more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions.So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn’t cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn’t.With “Black or White,” Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987’s Bad, he’d grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man’s bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him “Wacko Jacko” was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs.Released only five months before the LA Riots, the Rodney King beating and murder of Latasha Harlins almost certainly factored into Jackson’s increasingly political slant. “Black or White” articulated a utopian vision of a post-racial future while acknowledging the sins of contemporary bigotry.  He demands equality, shouting that he “ain’t second to none.” He growls, “I ain’t scared of no sheets” (presumably Klansmen). Its hook offers his dream of a color-blind society, echoing Martin Luther King.But this was Michael Jackson, not O’ Shea. Being King of Pop meant the need for mass appeal. The “Black or White” video exists as a microcosm of Dangerous itself. It potently affirms Jackson’s manhood, offers passionate screeds against racial strife, gang violence, and a parasitic American media. This is the album as multi-media spectacle, a precursor to Lemonade, with accusations of infidelity substituted for videos of Macaulay Culkin doing air guitar windmills to a Slash guitar solo and lip sync rapping about turf wars.The lone #1 single from the 32-million selling Dangerous, “Black or White” spent seven weeks atop the Billboard charts. Directed by John Landis (“Thriller,” National Lampoon’s Animal House) the first quarter of its video reveals Jackson’s mischievous child-like streak, with Culkin towing out Spinal Tap-sized speakers, amplifying the volume to “ARE YOU NUTS!?!,” and shredding so hard that George Wendt gets ejected into the stratosphere screaming “Da Bears.”It blends into his idealistic visionary side that wanted to heal the world through philanthropy and moonwalking. There is pop locking with Balinese dancers, rain dances with Native Americans, folk dances in front of the Kremlin, and the serenade of a Hindu goddess on a freeway. This is the magical Michael Jackson of our early memories—the man with the graceful dance moves and lithe falsetto that seemed celestially ordained (masking a notoriously intense perfectionist streak). Faces of all races harmoniously morph into one another, the most cutting edge FX that 1991 had to offer.In the third section, boy becomes man: Jackson struts through a wall of flames, Henley shirt open, screaming at his enemies like a mad king. It gives way to Culkin rapping in shades and oversized gold chains, which is just as well considering that this is the man who actually spit the bars. Jackson’s embrace of hip-hop not only aligned him with the popular sound of black (and white) youth culture, it adds an aggressive masculinity unseen in his catalogue, and ultimately paved the way for the late period Biggie therapy session.Of course, in the final section, Jackson turns into a black panther. You understand that meaning. So did millions of parents in Tipper Gore America, who flooded Fox and its local affiliates with phone calls, forcing Jackson’s team to re-cut and sanitize the video.A quarter century later, it seems absurd that Michael Jackson smashing a few windows before turning into a Jungle Book character could be cause for mass protest, but you have to remember how adored and family-friendly Michael Jackson was. My parents only owned two records: Thriller and Bad. So until I was 9 years old, I listened to those two almost every single day of my life, and honestly I didn’t really need anything else. Michael Jackson was my entire conception of music. Millions more could say the same thing.So when he dropped “Black or White,” it was shocking. If he was previously pop’s Peter Pan figure, Jackson had suddenly adopted a more carnal streak, but even here it was cartoonish. If the adult world looked dull and stifling, Jackson’s imagination offered a hope that it was possible not to wind up like George Wendt, bloated on a couch with a bored housewife. You could hang out with Macaulay Culkin, dance on top of the Statue of Liberty, and if all else failed, you could transform into a panther and bounce.* * *Imagine being Teddy Riley in 1991. You’ve gone from humble origins in Harlem to inventing New Jack Swing; you've produced multiple hits for your own band Guy, Bobby Brown, and Keith Sweat (“I Want Her”). Then late one night, you get a phone call from Michael Jackson telling you that he needs you to produce his new album—in effect making you the new Quincy Jones. All before your 24th birthday.Before Riley headed west, Jackson had labored on Dangerous for over a year to varying degrees of success. Something always seemed off. Bad might have been the last album before hip-hop became the de facto soundtrack of urban culture. 1988 changed everything. Public Enemy, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane left the competition sounding effete and timid. Gang wars and the crack epidemic continued to inflame inner cities. Songs like “Smooth Criminal” seemed obsolete. Meanwhile Jackson’s sister Janet had recently delivered a hard-stomping R&B-pop classic in 1989’s Rhythm Nation 1814. Its influence on her older brother was so great that he even asked Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to produce Dangerous. Out of loyalty to Janet, they turned him down. According to his engineer, Bruce Swedien, Michael was searching for something “very street that young people would be able to identify with.”He wasn’t alone. His longtime competition Prince sought to re-connect in a similar fashion, forming the New Power Generation with rapper, Tony M. Released just one month before Dangerous, the purple one’s Diamonds and Pearls exists as a companion piece, documents of blurring eras. As ’80s pop gave way to ’90s hip-hop, they sought to find their place in the re-configured landscape. Except while Prince predictably constructed his own insular unit, Jackson looked outwards to Riley, the hottest producer of the moment.If that seems obvious today, it wasn’t at the start of 1991. Many mainstream artists still saw hip-hop as a passing fad or stereotyped it as nihilistic and violent. Jackson needed to walk the fine line between disposable bubblegum rap like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and alienating longtime disciples with something too radical.After preparing grooves in Q-Tip’s Soundtrack Studio in Queens, Riley flew out to the Neverland Ranch to meet the master. There was a tour of the trophy room, the carousel, and the zoo, and then after they talked late into the night, Jackson put Riley on his personal helicopter and had him flown to the Universal City Hilton, a short distance from the San Fernando Valley studios where they recorded Dangerous. Riley began work the next day.Jackson established nerve centers at Record One and Larrabee Studios, just a few miles down Ventura Blvd. The latter had the SSL mixing console that Riley needed to make the tracks slap, and despite his pop reputation, Jackson wanted his new songs as hard as humanly possible. Engineers remember Jackson demanding that they play the New Jack Swing songs so loud that your ears bled. He invariably blew up a pair of headphones each session.As you’d expect, the recording process boasted its requisite share of idiosyncrasy. Nancy Reagan visited the studio once, requiring the Secret Service to search the place for hours prior to her visit. Brooke Shields called frequently to talk to Michael, who materialized every day in the same black dress pants and red button-down shirt (he had a clothing rack of just two items).One night, he left early to go to Tower Records, which had been shut down just for him to spend $1,500 on CDs. Another afternoon, he ordered several $900 remote controlled motorcycles brought to the studio. Despite usually eating meals prepared by a personal chef, Jackson requested McDonald’s for lunch on one occasion. He’d never actually eaten there before, but someone told him it was good, so he ordered one of everything on the menu and took a small bite of each. (The fish sandwich particularly wowed him.)Then there was Madonna. During March and April of 1991, Jackson and Madonna went out to dinner at least three times, which led tabloids to immediately report that they were dating. During these conversations, Jackson reportedly asked her to duet on the unfinished version of what became, “In the Closet.”“I think all he wanted was a provocative title, and ultimately he didn’t want the content of the song to live up to the title,” Madonna said at the time. “I said, ‘Look, Michael, if you want to do something with me, you have to be willing to go all the way or I’m not going to do it.’”His engineers remember her visiting him once at the studio, where they spent a little time in his private room in the back. “When I asked Michael later about her visit he said that she ‘scared’ him,” his engineer Rob Disner later said. “I think we all speculated that she tried to make a ‘move’ on him but Michael never said. In any event, we never saw her again.”The creative union most likely fizzled due to major stylistic divergences. Madonna imagined an extreme makeover: giving him a Caesar haircut, getting him out of his bedazzled military uniforms, taking him to New York and hanging out with the voguers, House of Xtravaganza. Michael wanted to go hip-hop and ultimately enlisted rappers Heavy D and Aqil Davidson of Wreckx N’ Effect as the principal guest vocalists.During the summer of ’91, competition broke out within the two studios and three rooms dedicated to Dangerous. At Record One, Bill Bottrell and Bruce Swedien worked on the album’s softer more adult contemporary material (and “Black or White”). At Larrabee, Riley handled the New Jack Swing half. Even though engineers remember the sessions as “giggly, innocent, and so much fun,” Jackson did his part to foster a friendly rivalry—bouncing back and forth between studios and taunting his teams, “Oh boy, they got some smelly jelly going on in there.”As Sony’s deadlines kept getting blown, Riley’s beats began forming the spine of the record. After being initially awestruck, Riley asserted more and more control at Jackson’s behest. “It worked itself out when he shook me,” Riley told HipHopWired in 2009. “[He was like] listen, you’re going to have to really produce me like you’ve produced a new artist. I need you to talk to me, I need you to criticize me, I need you to comment, I need you to give me all of you. I want the Teddy Riley that got that record out of Guy and the records out of your previous artists.”If Michael danced in the studio, it meant that a track sounded right. No matter what, Jackson ensured that the melodies were his own, while Riley sought to merge his trademark New Jack Swing with Quincy Jones’ baroque pop. At one point, L.A. Reid and Babyface were brought in to help produce, but none of their contributions made the final cut. Over 60 songs wound up being written over a period of 18 months. It cost $10 million in total, not counting video costs.When Jackson revealed the final tracklist to Riley, the latter expected to see his name once or twice. Instead, Riley produced six of the 14 songs—arguably all the material that has aged the best. As a result of his contributions, you can convincingly argue that Dangerous is Jackson’s final classic album and the best full-length of the New Jack Swing era.As soon as you pressed play on the tape, Riley’s drums attacked with Scud-era force. “Jam.” The sound of glass breaking, bells reminiscent of LL Cool J’s “Jingling Baby,” funky drums that knock like Clyde Stubblefield was behind the kit, and roaring saxophone licks. The words “you want to get up and jam” are initially buried in the mix, but the vocals are as acrobatic as a highlight reel, so it only made sense that the Chicago Bulls used it in their 1992 championship video. Starring Michael Jordan and Kris Kross, the “Jam” clip became almost as iconic as “Black or White.” Filmed in an abandoned rat-infested armory on the South Side of Chicago, it finds Michael Jackson teaching Jordan how to dance and the other MJ teaching him to hoop. Through the wonders of special effects, Jackson ultimately swishes shots that not even Steph Curry can hit; but not even the greatest dancer of the last half-century can teach Jordan how to dance. Point Jackson.Riley recruited Jackson’s favorite rapper Heavy D for four nimble bars, his baritone artfully offsetting the singer’s falsetto growl. The first song wastes no time in articulating the album’s leitmotif. Jackson urges the world to come together, decries false prophets crying of doom, and admits that the universe is a complicated place full of “tears for fears.” He’s “conditioned by the system” and doesn’t want to be preached to. His ultimate realization is that you have to “live each day like it’s the last,” find inner peace to stay strong against the haters, and when in doubt, jam.You can see these themes stressed on nearly every song. “Why You Wanna Trip on Me” exists as a mission statement. This is the Michael who fame has isolated and forced into retreat. There’s a newfound menace in his voice, an angelic sneer, as he recites a litany of crippling ailments (world hunger, illiteracy, disease, gangs, homelessness, drug addiction, corruption, police brutality)—and yet ironically, he has somehow become the media’s bullseye. Written during his 33rd year, Jackson can’t help but implicitly compare himself to Jesus—a popular healer who wants to help, misinterpreted and publicly crucified.  But even though Teddy Riley had Jesus, Jesus never had Teddy Riley. These drums could turn stone walls to white sand, the vocals are meticulously layered, the multiple bridges leave just enough room for interpretative dance moves. Jackson adapts seamlessly to the new genre, funkier than Guy, more lyrically incisive than Bobby Brown.Without Madonna, “In the Closet” received a cameo from Princess Stephanie of Monaco, mainly because Michael liked her sultry speaking voice even though she couldn’t sing. Shot in the desert, the Herb Ritts video stars Naomi Campbell at her pret a porter peak. Michael wears a tank top with a plunging neckline. It’s probably the most erotically charged of his career, about as far from “Thriller” as Basic Instinct is to The Mask.  You can trace Timbaland and the Neptunes experiments to a song like “She Drives Me Wild,” in which their former mentor created the percussion tracks from automotive sounds: car horns, motorcycles idling and revving, vehicles starting and screeching. This is probably Jackson’s closest attempt to match his sister’s Rhythm Nation.Some interpreted it as a desire to catch up, but it’s more emblematic of his lust to conquer. If Off the Wall was Jackson mastering late ’70s soul and disco, Thriller was his perfection of ’80s pop. This is Jackson showing that he could blend hip-hop and R&B better than anyone had previously imagined. The new decade starts here, with artists like Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, TLC, R. Kelly, et al. taking cues from Jackson and Riley’s alchemy. To say nothing of Kanye, Drake, and countless others still atop the charts.Dangerous has its flaws. The ballads on the back (non-Riley) half of the album could pass for gospel renditions of Celine Dion schmaltz. Despite its noble message and Jackson’s statement that it was the song he was most proud of writing, “Heal the World” is essentially “We Are The World Pt. 2.” The theme from Free Willy, “Will You Be There” offers a sweet sentiment, but it’s not exactly “I Believe I Can Fly.” “Gone Too Soon” falls into that same category of beautifully intentioned crooning that ultimately sounds like a dentist office doxology, especially when contrasted with the brilliant funk of the first side.If nothing else, they display the full range of his sharply targeted social consciousness, one that encompassed environmentalism, the AIDS pandemic, and every other affliction that still plagues the globe. In that sense, Dangerous might be Jackson’s most complete album, spanning dance music to dark nights of the soul. It’s a portrait of a persecuted genius, desperate to stay relevant, burdened with guilt and rage, lashing out at villains and offering inspiration to allies—always making it seem effortless.  * * *My favorite song on Dangerous is “Remember the Time.” Like so many others on this album, it’s inextricable from its video, which also received the MJ treatment: simultaneous premieres on MTV, Fox and BET in February of 1992. Directed by John Singleton, it stars Eddie Murphy, Iman, the Pharcyde, Magic Johnson, Tiny Lister, and some adorable striped tabbies. It’s probably the only song from Dangerous that can still go off in any club on any given night.As far as I’m concerned, it’s the greatest music video ever made, a New Jack Swing hybrid of Cleopatra and Indiana Jones. There are swirling hourglasses, busts of Pharaohs, hand drums, wriggling snakes, and Michael Jackson as a gilded wizard with dance moves so smooth that he can even elude the future Deebo. He’s so cool that steals the Pharaoh’s wife (who also happens to be David Bowie’s future wife) and then disappears into a cloud of gold dust, just as his capture seems imminent.Being a child of the ’80s and ’90s meant that Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Michael Jordan were your heroes. (Maybe you liked Larry Bird or something, but I assume if that’s the case, you’ve long stopped reading this review.) And in his videos, Michael Jackson managed to best them all, making him the undisputed King. For most of my pre-adolescence, he was a pure sorcerer, a demigod immune to the gravitational pull and perimeters that stifle the rest of us.At 10 years old, I assumed the video was shot somewhere in Egypt, because even though I no longer believed in bullshit like Santa Claus, I still accepted Michael Jackson at face value. Besides, nothing else he did seemed like it operated under any budgetary constraint. Only about a year ago did I learn that it was shot at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake, a soundstage across the street from my apartment that I’d obliviously walked past thousands of times. It was one of those depressing realizations that makes much less sense than believing that Michael Jackson built a time machine and brought the star of Beverly Hills Cop, a supermodel, and the best point guard ever, along with him to the time of Ramses the Great. Watch that video again and tell me otherwise.In that same way, it’s difficult to listen to Dangerous without considering the child molestation allegations that greeted him shortly after he came home from its marathon 69-concert tour. It’s tricky not to read too much into a song like “In the Closet.” How do you reconcile that someone as pure of spirit as Jackson could potentially have a monstrous streak?Whether you believe the allegations or not, it’s clear that he was never the same after Dangerous. The damage became too absolute, the vitriol aimed his way too severe for someone that sensitive. Never again could his music exist on its own merits, the illimitable genius ravaged by prescription pills, insomnia, and obliterating pressure. Dangerous is the last time that Michael Jackson was Michael Jackson.In an interview given shortly after the release of Dangerous, Jackson said that his goal was to do “an album that was like Tchaikovsky’s ‘Nutcracker Suite.’ In a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it…. Something that would live forever.” He’s been gone for over half a decade, but I still think about this quote every time I walk past that sound stage—considering the possibilities that Michael Jackson unlocked in every song, the infinite magic that he could create out of an empty room, the orphic visions of one of our final myths.  
8152	13882	"Despite sharing two members (three if you count jack-of-all-trades contributor Frederik Swahn), the Amazing and Dungen don't sound overly similar. In the quickest, dirtiest sense, the Amazing trade Dungen singer and sole songwriter Gustav Ejstes for former Granada frontman Christoffer Gunrup, and where Ejstes sings entirely in Swedish, Gunrup opts for English. The two men don't share all of the same influences (though they do share some), and that's where the groups diverge, because if there's one thing Ejstes and Gunrup have in common, it's a keen faithfulness to their particular sources of inspiration. The Amazing's reference points aren't nearly as broad as Dungen's, but each project succeeds by reproducing vintage sounds so lovingly and masterfully that a lack of originality ceases to matter.Most people first caught wind of the Amazing late last year via the wonderfully lissome single ""Dragon"", the majority of which is given over to misty, moody acoustic folk rumination in the vein of Nick Drake. Almost half of the album explicitly mines this same terrain. The achingly sensitive, fingerpicked fragilities ""Beach House"", ""Is It Likely"", and ""The Strangest Thing"" may skirt the line that keeps out soggily simplistic pushovers like Damien Rice and David Gray, but Gunrup's alluring lyrics and the sheer loveliness of the instrumentation ensure they stay on the non-douchey side of the divide.The element of ""Dragon"" that leaps out on first listen is its beautifully fluid twin-guitar refrain that evokes the easy-bake grooves of the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. This sun-dappled style crops up again at various points on the album, and, in a more general sense, the parts of the record that don't find Gunrup conjuring up Drake's pink moons and northern skies instead see the band exploring various permutations of stoner-friendly rock. Opener ""The Kirwan Song"" features a sublime interpolation of Fleetwood Mac's ""Sunny Side of Heaven"", penned by the eponymous Danny Kirwan and recorded just as the Mac were transitioning from jam-friendly blues-rock to soft-focus pop. Fittingly, Gunrup and co. take Kirwan's original, intimate instrumental and blow it up to stadium size, complete with thunderous drum rolls from Dungen kitmaster Johan Holmegard. That's just a warm-up for the massive, molten ""Code II"", a roiling monolith of wicked, doomy guitar shards and more skull-rattling drumming.The hazy, heavily treated ""Dead"" could pass for mid-period Flaming Lips, but it's on the penultimate ""Had to Keep Walking"" that the Amazing really kick into interstellar overdrive. As the song cycles through a cerebral, ruminative groove, it touches on post-rock before melting into a keyboard-laden head trip ripped straight from the Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd playbooks. As far-flung as Dungen may be, they're clearly not going to be able to exhaust every avenue of album-era revivalism all by themselves."
2472	19953	"Best known for defining the pulse of Fela Kuti’s propulsive Afrobeat sound, the self-taught Tony Allen is a near superhuman combination of metronomic sense of time, light touch, economy, endurance, and musicality. Though it took a long time, his distinctive beat is part of the world’s musical vocabulary now. Since parting ways with Fela, he’s done quite a range of work, including a couple of recent, fairly high-profile collaborations with Damon Albarn that took him pretty far away from the pigeonhole people tend to place him in on the basis of his best-known playing. Film of Life doesn’t quite break new ground for Allen, but it does offer a pretty solid and succinct demonstration of Afrobeat’s adaptability to changing times. There are no side-long epics in the Fela mold here, but Allen packs quite a bit into each of these four-to-seven-minute-tracks, building up from his own drums grooves with hypnotic guitar and bass patterns, a richly arranged horn section, and an assortment of other sounds that are nearly all overwhelmed by the massive rhythm that dominates everything.Allen himself handles vocals on the first two tracks, mostly talking in his deep bass register and aided by a female chorus, narrating a personal history and thanking the listener for being there. His voice is appropriately situated well down in the mix; he does his best talking with his hands, and though he shows a little uncharacteristic flash here and there, the really impressive thing about Allen is the way he can take a simple, slow beat like the one on ""Tiger’s Skip"" and make it sing when a lot of drummers would have trouble just staying in time at that tempo. Comparing it to the much faster beat on the storming, spacey funk instrumental ""Ewa"" reveals a lot about what makes his playing so special; no matter what else is going on, Allen has an ability to stay steady and fill time with exactly as much embellishment as necessary.Albarn’s guest vocal turn on ""Go Back"" provides the album’s highlight and the closest thing to a single that it has to offer. The man could sound sad singing ""The Wheels on the Bus"", and the contrast of his hang-dog delivery and Allen’s spryness makes for a song as good as anything the two have done together in the Good, the Bad, and the Queen or Rocket Juice & the Moon. Moments like this and Kuku’s totally unexpected Auto-Tuned vocal in the second half of ""Koko Dance"" take Film of Life a few steps past a simple summary of the things Allen excels at and make it something to hear even for people who aren’t Afrobeat obsessives."
12486	9034	"
    SCSI-9's debut album from 2002 is one of the better-kept secrets of the first wave of microhouse. Released on Force Tracks at the precise moment when its powers-that-be were talking up ""digital disco"" and rediscovering pop, Digital Russian instead opted for an almost purist take on dubby tech-house, emphasising hypnotic, endless grooves, carefully programmed house rhythms, deep dub bass, and simple, mnemonic melodies-- again, purist, but frequently perfect. It was also surprisingly energetic, and this unexpected physicality gave a sense of purpose to its anti-eclectic, anti-song formalism. The contrast between each groove's hard core and soft surfaces generated a dancefloor intensity that overrode charges of sameyness, not to mention making it a great housework album.
    On 2004's Mini 12""-- their first for Kompakt-- SCSI-9 gave the impression that they'd finally caught the digital disco bug, or at least some closely related strain: ""Autumn Love""'s juxtaposition of a sunny breakbeat disco rhythm and majestic strings verged on Balearic, while ""Mini""'s skipping, stuttering, stereo-panning groove was positively blessed-out, recalling Orbital's ""Belfast"" or ""Halcyon"".
    On The Line of Nine, SCSI-9 return to the dreamy, longform grooves of their first album, with little of the rainbow-colored pop immediacy that the Mini single implied. What SCSI-9 have retained from Mini is a certain warm gentleness: with its cheerful basslines and glittering trebly melodies, The Line of Nine is mostly relaxed and unhurried. Many of the songs feature percussion that mimics the crackle of vinyl, perhaps in homage to Farben's supremely sluggish microhouse of yore. Despite this, the album still feels ""of a piece"" with its predecessor-- if anything the shift is one of perspective. While Digital Russian concentrated on propulsive rhythms which gradually accumulated lush atmospherics, like a stylus picking up dust from the grooves in a record, The Line of Nine favors glistening arrangements which slowly coalesce into a groove.

    This gear change from throb to drift ultimately renders The Line of Nine the lesser album, if only slightly. While its supine shimmer allows the duo to focus on sculpting even more scintillating textures than before, in the absence of an obviously pop sensibility, its accommodating glow occasionally encourages the mind to wander.

    What's more, I can't help but feel that these albums would make more sense if the chronology was reversed: Digital Russian's long stretches of driving, multi-layered percussive grooves-- putting the tech back into the tech-house-- would fit comfortably into many current DJ sets, while The Line of Nine's tic-toc rhythms and spacey keyboard work would have made perfect sense on Force Tracks or Kompakt in 2002.

    Putting all this to one side, it's very difficult to fault this album in any significant way: SCSI-9 are blessed (or cursed) with such sturdy consistency that it's tempting to wish for just one terrible track, if only to hear what a terrible SCSI-9 track would sound like. Instead, the most one can say is that some tracks are more memorable than others, cautious variations on the formula resulting in ""the one with the graceful piano"" or ""the one with the eerily woozy chimes.""

    It's these little touches that frequently make The Line of Nine a joy to listen to, albeit a quiet and unassuming one. While never courting outright weirdness or hippie abstraction, the album finds SCSI-9 at their most intricate, and the interplay of bouncing, rattling percussion and spiralling synth tones is enough to carry tunes that might otherwise seem insubstantial.

    Towards the end of the album, SCSI-9 wander into some darker corners: The keyboard riffs become more foreboding than soothing, and the sparkling surfaces begin to feel icy. These culminate in ""Morskaya"" and ""Ne Contsom a Coltsom"", two gorgeous but dark-hearted widescreen epics reminiscent of Luciano at his best. It's these tentative gestures towards other sounds and other emotions that confirm the creeping feeling that producers as consummately talented as SCSI-9 should be pushing themselves further outside their own creative margins. One or two duff tracks would be a small price to pay.

16513	998	"These alt-country types are supposed to be storytellers, right?  Spinning
    the everyday into gold and crap like that?  Well, if that's the road they
    drive, Richard Buckner may have finally run into his titular impasse.  After
    documenting the achiness and breakiness of his heart over the course of a
    number of fine records in the mid-to-late 90s, the San Francisco native
    switched gears to take on the project of adapting the histories of others
    (namely, the backwater protagonists of poet Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River
    Anthology).  The result, 2000's The Hill, was a glorious, barely
    cohesive run-on sentence of a record, crammed almost to bursting with narrative
    detail.  Still, even though Buckner did an admirable job of getting into his
    characters' heads, he was obviously telling other peoples' stories, begging the
    question: had he run out of his own?
Impasse marks Buckner's return to the first person, as well as a reversion
    to the blunter rock persona he picked up on 1998's Since and then quickly
    abandoned in favor of The Hill's sparser acoustics.  This shouldn't be
    (and, for the most part, isn't) a bad thing; as the pop-rockers that kick off
    the album (""Born Into Giving It Up"" and ""Hoping Wishers Never Lose"") suggest,
    he's pretty good at it.  Still, even between these two songs, the similarities
    nag-- the same low, metallic guitars clang in the introductions, and the same
    humming synths wash over the choruses.

    It doesn't hurt that a number of pleasant numbers in the same mold (Buckner's wife
    Penny Jo's drums being the main distinguishing features) show themselves throughout
    the rest of the album; problem is, these are the best the record has to offer.
    Buckner's lyrical mode has gone from despairingly particular to optimistically
    impressionist, which is fine for the more upbeat songs.  Without that extra weight,
    however, the more folky tunes don't hold up so well-- where we once were given a
    story, start to finish, Buckner now pours out a succession of vague images and
    emotions, and whenever he decides to cut off his stream of consciousness, it
    sounds like it's a little too soon.  Only the sort of epic, sweeping guitar
    gestures Buckner applies to ""Dusty from the Talk"" make it sound complete; the
    others end up fragmented and premature.  And when he tries to do dire, as on
    ""Were You Tried & Not as Tough"", it ends up sounding forced, which is awfully
    disconcerting on a record as unforcedly simple as this one often is.

    While Buckner's uniqueness still stems from his gorgeous and clear but deep-as-dirt
    baritone, his voice also seems complicit in homogenizing these songs.  The same
    twang-tricks seem to pop up over and over again, and, unsupported by sonic variety
    in the songs themselves, this makes melodies all run together.  I mean, they're all
    nice on their own and everything, but over the course of an album, the effect is of
    a guy at a party that won't stop telling the same story.  With the details excised,
    the story Impasse tells isn't even that personal anymore.  Like a ride through
    the prairie on a summer day, it's pretty, but about as flat as it gets."

My real name is Rain: a man with no fear, a man who do everything he desire without any law.""
    So reads the introduction to The Upsetter Selection. So far, so Lee Perry, then... All the same, it's just as well to admit that we'd be lost without the cosmic-travelling, lunatic-savant schtick. By now most of the stories surrounding this man-- burning his own Black Ark Studios to the ground, talking to palm trees, walking backwards through Kingston hitting the ground with a hammer, claiming to run the International Monetary Fund-- are as well loved as they are known. They're part of his appeal, as key to his legendary status as the music he makes.
    Keep an eye out for smoke and mirrors, though. View it from another angle and you can see that he's playing to the crowd-- fucking with us because we like it-- and you may even notice that that a kernel of truth lies nested at the heart of many of his eccentrically expressed statements, too. If nothing else, Perry's right about his bravery and disregard for convention; he's spent the past four decades almost single-handedly writing, rewriting, and occasionally shredding reggae's rulebook. Be it his collaborations with Clement ""Coxsone"" Dodd at Studio One, his stint with Joe Gibbs, his chart-topping songs with the Upsetters, his work with vocal artists including Bob Marley, U-Roy, and Junior Byles, or the alternate realities conjured by his dubs, it's safe to say that even the most casual music fan will have encountered his work at some point in their lives.

    Claiming an irrefutable place among Jamaica's foremost musical innovators, Perry has already been the subject of countless anthologies, box sets, primers, and cash-ins. Here, however, as part of Trojan Records' ongoing series of celebrity curated anniversary compilations, he gets to select himself. It's a riveting 2xCD journey, documenting most every stage of the producer's career. Especially notable are initial experiments such as dropping jagged squalls of baby screams into ""People Funny Boy"" and reversing the vocal of Burt Walters' ""Honey Love"", then releasing it as a whole new Upsetters' record, entitled ""Evol Yenoh"". Straightforward, a bit bonkers, and crying out to be done, these tricks went on to become trademarks that are now immediately recognized around the world-- the things that made his name.

    But why stay rooted on the earthly plane? Fast forward and you'll find Perry crediting himself as the man who helped Bob Marley vanquish the dark spirits that were at the time preventing his success. Listening to the languid defiance in the singer's voice on 1970's ""Duppy Conqueror"", it's an easy claim to believe. Regardless of the metaphysical or supernatural, Perry's relationship with the Wailers continued for many years, the collaboration's finest few minutes represented by ""Small Axe"", a song Marley never bettered.

    Disc Two, meanwhile, ups the interest right from the start, kicking off with a triptych of ""skank"" tunes-- Charlie Ace & Lee Perry's ""Cow Thief Skank"" and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry & the Upsetters' ""Bathroom Skank"" and ""Kentucky Skank"". Almost confrontationally experimental for their time, these cuts remain mind-blowing. Packed with torrential collages of effects, they're perfect examples of the studio-as-instrument approach to production. Perry wrenches everything he can out of the mixing desk, then throws yet more at it, creating cavernous percussion rolls and splattering them with the greasy crackles of frying chicken or bursts of lascivious bump and grind. The result is disorienting, weird and extraordinarily seductive. Reach just far enough and ""Cow Thief""'s bricolage of several different songs, recorded in 1973, can even be seen as a precursor to electronic music's sampling and hip-hop's re-contextualization of the breakbeat. Still, all highfalutin ideas fly out of the window when you learn that the record's sole point was to take the piss out of fellow sound man Niney the Observer's shoes.

    While capable of extreme oddness (both personal and sonic), Perry has always had a natural gift for working with singers. His skill is unmistakable on Jah Lion's ""The Lama (aka The Spiritual Whip)"", Prince Jazzbo's ""Penny Reel"", and Max Romeo's ""Fire Fe the Vatican"", but nowhere is it better displayed than on Susan Cadogan's ""Hurt So Good"", still one of the sexiest pieces of music ever committed to wax. Moving on through 1983's ""I Am a Madman"" to the title track of 2003's Grammy-winning reggae album Jamaican E.T., it becomes evident that we'll probably never know the real Lee Perry, how sane he is, whether he really believes the things he says. It's not important, either, because, as great a creation as his persona may be, his music is infinitely better.
    "
4426	17822	"It was 3 p.m. and sunny my first time through Implodes' Recurring Dream, a mistake I only let myself make once. Dream, like the Chicago drone-rockers' debut Black Earth before it, is inexorably nocturnal music, dank and oily, suffused with creeping dread. Ever hear of highway hypnosis? You pull into the garage after a long drive only to realize you can't really recall the last several hours of your life? That feeling's all over Recurring Dream, a mesmerizing record with a distinctly sinister edge. Even as you're drawn in by its narcotic murk, you can't quite shake the feeling that something terrible's happened that you just can't quite recall.From the layers of scum strewn across its every surface to the minutes-before-sunset cover art, Recurring Dream is well acquainted with the darkness. As on Black Earth, Implodes' gloomy vibe is equal parts post-punk disaffection, shoegaze's motion-blur, and the heft of post-rock. Start mining for reference points, and you'll never stop; the Jesus and Mary Chain's Darklands and Jesu's Conqueror made my notes before I realized I'd never make it out of the Js alive. Despite these disparate landmarks, the uniformly sour mood and near-constant drone that runs through just about every second of Recurring Dream gives it a kind of tunnel vision: whether it's the Mogwai-style blowout in ""Ex Mass"" or the early Beach House-on-dilaudid vibe of ""Sleepyheads"", the persistent crackle seems to cast everything in their world in the same sunless hue.Spend a little time getting acclimated to the darkness, though, and you'll start to see just how many things are moving around back there. Even after a dozen listens or so, these songs still seem to change shape, their haunting echoes and lurking rhythms fluidly rearranging themselves whenever your back's turned. And when they do break from the near-oppressive opacity, you still up and take notice. ""Prisms and the Nature of Light"" refracts an acoustic kumbaya into something stranger, more surreal. And halfway through several of these songs, guitarist Ken Camden takes a solo that burns through the night like the trail of neon in your rear-view. Their brilliance is quickly swallowed up into Recurring Dream's beyond-black coloring, but these rare flashes of light only seem to deepen the engrossing darkness that surrounds them.On the whole, though, Recurring Dream's a slinkier-sounding record than its predecessor: the songs are more spacious, less prone to snarling, and they've lowered the volume on Black Earth's stuck-between-stations fizz. It's a tradeoff: the more deliberate Dream doesn't move unless it has to, upping the intensity whenever it does. But, for all the tension Recurring Dream builds up over its 45-minute runtime, there's precious little in the way of relief: Black Earth's periodic blowouts served as dread-diffusers, but the foreboding Recurring Dream closer ""Bottom of a Well"" prefers mystery, sending you back off into the night, disquieted."
14217	3664	"The combination of the electronic dance music community's restored appetite for disco with a more general 80s wanderlust has opened the door for a minor Italo disco rediscovery (pleasant side effect: a less hostile attitude towards camp). Not surprisingly, a handful of Italo-themed compilations have been issued in the past 12 months; only a few have been as fun, as revelatory and as representative as Unclassics.

    Selected, mixed, and bankrolled entirely by Metro Area's Morgan Geist, this mix follows in the tradition of the Environ label head's lovingly deployed Unclassics vinyl releases, which themselves were sort of dust-off and rescue missions for the waylaid orphans of the Italo boom. Cherry-picked and sorta-mixed by Geist himself, the tracks on this continuous set are strung together by all the things that made Italo interesting, namely a sense of goofiness, color, and theatre. To that end, Italo represents the furthest functional extreme from dance music's other current fascination-- microhouse; in the interest of balance and perversity, it makes sense that both should be dominating dance music's discourse at same time.

    Almost uniformly un-self conscious, Unclassics amounts to a seven-course spread of opulent synths, syrupy melodies, and joyously over-the-top vocal performances. Dance Reaction's ""Disco Train"" is sung by an adenoidal Cameo-soundalike, Victor's ""Go On Do It"" is a campy call-and-response that has slavering raps buzzing up against a female's breathy refrains, and Pluton & Humanoids' ""World Invaders"" contains an opera diva and a vocoded robot anxiously engaging in some sort of epic Wellesian struggle between man and machine (their resolution: duet!)

    The highlight of the mix is probably Geist's own Hot Edit of Margueritas' shimmering ""Margherita"", which strips it of its made-for-Eurovision vocals and recasts it as an ever zippier ""Popcorn"". Drenched in peppy analog pings, handclaps, and Mexican horns, it's one of the most ridiculously infectious dance tracks in recent memory. Also good is Eurofunk's ""Manshortage"", which deploys a liquid guitar line over a weird, spindly little electro groove. Come to think of it, the only thing that really approaches disco orthodoxy is the twirling strings of the Purple Flash Orchestra's penultimate ""Freedom Now""-- and even that is quickly upended by Gaz Nevada's oddball eight-minute closer, ""Special Agent Man.""

    It's a weird collection of oblong disco, to be sure, and repeated listens do nothing to diminish its freshness and off-kilter appeal. Credit's due to Geist, not just for being prescient enough to release these tracks at the right time, but for swooping down to rescue them in the first place. Even if it is hard to believe that anybody could ever forget source material like this."
14361	6209	"As many others have done this year, the other night I went to see the Pixies' reunion tour. Next week, the Nirvana box set is finally released, as is a new two-disc expanded version of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral; Low's upcoming Sub Pop record kicks off with a track whose rhythm section and vocal melody sound like a miniature version of Alice in Chains; Q magazine named The Red Hot Chili Peppers the Best Act in the World Today at its 2004 awards show; TV commercials for Green Day's American Idiot reminds us that 10 years ago they released Dookie; and now Pearl Jam are lionized with the two-disc, 33-track, best-of album, Rearviewmirror. I'd be frightened that we're about to undergo a full-blown 90s alternarock revival-- an era depressingly and backhandedly praised as much for what it was not (e.g. the hair metal that it ""kicked out,"" or the nu-metal that some of it slowly morphed into) than the music it produced.  But then, it never went away, did it?

    In recent years, Billy Corgan's Zwan, a reunited Jane's Addiction, the Scott Weiland-fronted Velvet Revolver, and the Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine mashup Audioslave have released records to varying degrees of commercial success.  Prior to that, the nascent sounds of grunge remained among the dominant North American hard rock templates throughout the 90s and into this decade, living on in a lineage that extended from its Seattle roots through Bush and Candlebox to Creed and Nickleback.

    Oddly, Pearl Jam have remained a constant since the days when 120 Minutes graduated to Alternative Nation, transitioning from stadium fillers to one of American rock's largest and most beloved cult bands, a Grateful Dead for the great washed.  After deftly turning their backs on fame just as much of the public seemed poised to turn on them, Pearl Jam cultivated the unwavering support of a cabal of devotees who followed the band across a string of studio albums that casual observers have likely forgotten-- No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act-- and the almost comical release of every live show from their 2000 tour, a move that, depending on your level of cynicism, was either a thank you or an unintentional fuck you to their lemmingesque fanbase.  Musically, Pearl Jam slightly spiced up their sound over the course of a decade, adding a few Eastern-tinged delicacies and some garage-rock snackfood to their typical meat-and-potatoes diet.  By the time Creed became a permanent fixture on late-90s rock radio, the Florida band sounded as much like Pearl Jam as, well, Pearl Jam themselves.
Rearviewmirror divides the band's career into an ""up side"" and a ""down side""-- the former are the earnest rockers, the latter are the earnest ballads-- although the monikers would also have been appropriate had they arranged the record chronologically.  The ""down side"" to Pearl Jam's career allowed many people to romanticize the group's shift away from the spotlight as one purely of choice, and the band has since been characterized by honesty, good intentions, and yeoman's work, the sort of qualities that often make for turgid, sometimes rote, faceless music.

    In truth, Pearl Jam were always planted squarely in the middle of the road. While Nirvana was characterized by punk's sound as much as its ethos, Soundgarden had one foot in contemporary metal, Smashing Pumpkins mixed 80s goth and new wave in with their glam, and Green Day, NIN, and the RHCP were clearly creatures of the post-punk era, Pearl Jam was always a classic rock band, the one alt-nation superstar that completely ignored both punk and its aftermath.  Pearl Jam were all solos and riffs and lighters-aloft, arena-rock sentiment; like so many 60s rockers, they looked to the Asian sub-continent for their first flirtations with ""growth"" and ""maturity""; they even cuddled up to the ""right"" rock 'n' roll architects (Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Neil Young).  To claim Pearl Jam as the greatest rock band of our time-- as many listeners and critics do-- is virtually a negation of the past 30 years of guitar-based music, a relieved sigh that the values of the 70s aren't completely lost.

    And... that works for a lot of people.  Pearl Jam struck chords within listeners like few of their contemporaries.  Those diehards probably looked at the Rearviewmirror tracklist and chuckled, wondering why it didn't include this rarity or that B-side (it does have a few key ones, e.g. ""Yellow Ledbetter"") or a handful of what the album rock stations used to call ""deep cuts.""  This comp isn't for them, though; it's for the rest of us, and a lot of listeners will likely glance at it, wonder where the hell ""Crazy Mary"" is, and consider it a handy career-spanner-- all the Pearl Jam they'll ever need.  If they buy it, those listeners will likely be surprised that-- despite some non-descript titles (""Corduroy"", ""Go"", ""Immortality"", the title track)-- they remember most of these tracks, and despite slipping well below the radar, the band has, in many ways, improved over the years.

    The record seemingly begins the same way as their debut, Ten, but this version of ""Once"" (like ""Alive"" and ""Black"") has been slightly re-mixed by Brendan O'Brien.  Hardly radical and barely noticeable, the new versions buff the shine from the originals, actually improving three of the band's better, more melodic early tracks.  On the album's first disc, the band's years of popularity-- through third album Vitalogy-- are only highlighted by the Singles track ""State of Love and Trust"" and the forceful ""Not For You"".

    A lot of the other big guns are better left unremembered: The five-against-one mutterings of ""Animal""; ""Evenflow"", ""Rearviewmirror"", and ""Go"" plod along, monuments to the appropriateness of the tag ""grunge""; ""Spin the Black Circle"" is their first step toward the clumsy romanticism of bygone days; and ""Jeremy"" remains as painful as ever.  Perhaps that last track is only truly powerful when coupled with images of Vedder's emotive pantomimes, hard-scrawled title cards that say things like ""the serpent was subtil [sic]"" and ""90210"", or a shirtless boy both wrapped in the American flag and standing in front of a wall of flames and crouching in the woods in front of an overblown photo of a teeth-baring fox...

    On the up side, the garage-esque ""Do the Evolution"" is either over-the-top fun or completely ridiculous, depending on whether or not you believe Pearl Jam actually possess a sense of humor (in this case, I think it's the former), and ""I Got Shit"" (formerly ""I Got ID""), ""Save You"", and ""Hail, Hail"" have a few more shades than the gray of the band's grunge era.

    On the way down, things are also scattered.  Like they do on the early rockers, Vedder's vocal diversions, tics, and lack of enunciation occasionally move from exaggerated emoting into self-parody (see, in particular, ""Given to Fly""). His voice is still the band's hallmark sound-- a mealy-mouthed, gravely style that influenced a decade of really, really shitty music-- and it's still fun to impersonate; unfortunately, on pain-wracked attempts to convey more universal emotions (the glib ""Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town"", the lyrical disaster ""Wishlist"", ""Better Man"", the awkward cover of ""Last Kiss""), it's not very fun to listen to.

    Even when Eddie's opening his mouth, the tunes are often excruciatingly drab dirges-- ""Immortality"" and ""Nothingman"" are the biggest offenders. (Yet ironically, the most overtly dirge-like track-- the almost mantra-esque, Eastern-tinged ""Who You Are""-- is one of the set's most effective.) Elsewhere, the patient ""Off He Goes"", ""Nothing As It Seems"", and ""Man of the Hour"" and the solipsistic ""I Am Mine"" all carry a more weathered, wise sense of self, and these tracks greatly upstage the more youthful and clumsy neo-emoisms of the band's better known songs-- in particular its ballads.

    In some ways, it makes sense that Pearl Jam are improving as they slip further from the gaze of contemporary listeners and into the neolithic caves of mid-70s classic rock.  For all the harm it unwittingly did to rock radio-- and for as comical as it can be in its most unchecked moments-- Vedder's voice is powerful and can even be captivating. The more considered and time-tested tones it now carries fit the band's more subtle shading.

    In full ham-fisted stadium rock mode, Pearl Jam now oddly seem miles away from Nirvana, still the best of their one-time Seattle contemporaries. Instead, they're not-so-distant cousins to the denim brigade, the faceless 70s arena rockers who dutifully punched time clocks and produced no-nonsense, sometimes hook-filled rock.  Today, Pearl Jam seems bruised, ever so slightly more adventurous, and, thanks to the devotion of their fans, they're afforded the chance to dress up as rock iconoclasts rather than take a slide toward VH1-ready adult contemporary balladry. It's like punk never happened."
3732	18625	"Upset frontwoman Ali Koehler has wandered through a fair share of the nine lives that often accompany the personnel-shuffling, lo-fi garage-pop world in which she's developed her reputation. Most recently she was the drummer for Best Coast, until a messy split (one on which she and frontwoman Bethany Cosentino publicly disagreed); before that, she cut her teeth as Frankie Rose's successor on drums in the ranks of the Vivian Girls. The rest of the band has likewise been places: lead guitarist Jenn Prince is a Vivian Girls contemporary, too, one who plays guitar occasionally in ""Kickball"" Katy Goodman's side project La Sera; and drummer Patty Schemel—well, the former Hole drummer needs little introduction.So it's noteworthy that Upset, on their first full-length, with Koehler at the helm of her own ship, should rewind the clock. From its opening lines to its resolved close, She's Gone is a whirlwind of instantly likeable do-overs: uncomplicated, sticky-catchy pop punk songs about small-picture woes that place the trio squarely back into sprightly, if dissatisfied, teenaged bodies. With songs like opener ""Back to School"" and the simple-progressioned ""About Me"", it's as though Koehler hunted down a time machine to travel to the early 2000s, intent upon rewriting that era's commercial pop-punk history with some decidedly more DIY and feminist ethics. ""Queen Frosteen"", a simple song about adolescent female rivalry (""Queen Frosteen, my enemy/ She's everything, I'm nobody"") is ""If You C Jordan"" for the Rookie crowd; ""Never Wanna"" is a speedbagging lament about shy crushes that's equipped to handle New Found Glory crowds. The record's 36 minutes are the sugary product one would expect from a new Vivian Girl-meets-Hole experiment, with a spunky roughness around the edges that endears them—perhaps intentionally—to both a young crowd and one that could've used a record like this when they were the young crowd.The sound of three well-vetted female musicians tearing through topics like rivals and drinking and following your dreams and kicking bad habits would, if they were coming from the band's male analogs, easily come off as manchild-y; at times these qualities do poke through Upset's scratchy tapestry. (Koehler and Prince are, after all, in their mid-20s; Schemel, whose powerful contributions to Upset originated in a Twitter-facilitated friendship with Koehler, is 46.) The set can feel a bit skeletal in its offerings, like a demo that got pushed through too quickly, and like the sugar rush of any pop punk, sometimes their dedication to the aesthetic loses its flavor—""Don't Lose Your Dinosaur"" is cute but waxes a bit saccharine in a Reading Rainbow, follow-your-dreams kind of way (""If it means that much to you/ Don't give up what you're meant to do,"" ""Don't lose your dinosaur/ 'Cause there's always more where that came from"")—but the immediacy of the subject matter seems more revisionist than immature.All said, She's Gone is delightfully restless teenaged guitar-pop made by grown, well-traveled women, the contrast of which necessarily adds a sheen of introspection over the whole affair. Its depth impresses itself in spots like the deepened instrumental break on ""Phone Calls"", the album's most fleshed-out track, giving the album an intentionality that its contemporaries, both past and present, often lack. (It's fitting that Kyle Gilbride of comrades-in-pluck Swearin' produced She's Gone, and that Don Giovanni Records would happily add it to their close-knit, youthful artillery of conscious punk.) The potential those moments bring is palpable, and that low-key maturity, the one that keeps She's Gone from being another delicious-yet-slapdash addition to an already replete base of teen angst, builds a platform from which the band will eventually and easily catch up with their adult selves."
2174	20323	"In ""Avatar"", the twenty-first episode of the third season of ""The X-Files"", actress Janie Woods-Morris portrays a madam named Lorraine Kelleher, who is questioned by Agents Mulder and Scully after the death of one of her prostitutes. (She meets her demise later in the episode.) Within ""The X-Files"" universe, spanning more than two-hundred episodes and nine seasons, Lorraine Kelleher is a minor part, to say the least. But producer Kai Hugo nonetheless chose the name for a track on his second full-length release under the Palmbomen alias. The track, with its canned claps, faux woodblock clops, acid lines and laser pips slowed by cough syrup, is a strange and woozy standout on an odd yet amiable effort.As Ganz Nackisch, Hugo favored the dusty-stylus distortion and filtered-house thump that was already out of fashion in France in the late '00s. By the time of his 2010 EP Moon Children, he had shifted gears, favoring the slo-mo arpeggios, 2am-hour synth washes and reverbed vocals popularized by the Drive soundtrack. ""Stock""—off his 2013 album Night Flight Europa—embraced the sounds of the continent, from Italo to taser-riddled electro but not much of it stuck. While past productions dabbled in vocals, Palmbomen II does away with them entirely and the album is decidedly more insular and the better for it, sounding like Hugo recorded it all while locked in his bedroom.If he did so it seems likely he was simultaneously watching every last DVD of ""The X-Files"": Each track on Palmbomen II derives its name from a character on the show, and Hugo's choices, like ""Lorraine Kelleher"", reflect an obsession and peculiarly deep knowledge of every sub-minor and one-off character. There’s no ""Knowle Rohrer"" or ""Marita Covarrubias"" to be found here, much less ""Toothpick Man"" or ""Luis Cardinal"", so even adepts of the show might not glean the connection. Instead, Hugo has a track named for the systems analyst situated near a volcano on Mount Avalon who had a silicone-like tentacle burst through his throat in one early episode (""Peter Tanaka"") as well as a Boards of Canada-esque one-minute interlude named for Mulder’s mother, ""Teena Mulder"".Taken in one setting, the album could use a bit more movement, BPM-wise, its pacing somewhere between drugged and extremely hungover. ""Gerd Thomas"" feels lethargic, the sluggishness of the 303 and handclaps offset by a sprinkling of marimba. The interlude ""Caitlin Ross"" sounds like it could be from a Ryuichi Sakamoto demo and ""Rebecca Waite"" rides percolating tropical hand drums, distorted thumb piano and a rattle that makes for one of the album’s brighter moments. Tape hiss infuses every number, giving the album a sense of nostalgia, right down to the garbled tape outro of ""Leo Danzinger"". But Hugo seems to be invoking the '90s not as a vague point of reference, but as a very specific point on a timeline. I’d peg it to 1992-1993, right when Aphex Twin’s own homemade acid compilation Selected Ambient Works 85-92 cuts off and when Chris Carter’s ""The X-Files"" first goes on the air."
2131	20427	"It Follows is a classic boy-meet-girls story, only the boy is using a fake name, the girl doesn’t know, and after they sleep together it turns out he’s passed more than fluids—specifically, a curse that makes her the target of an unstoppable, unmerciful demon. The demon takes human form; it can’t be seen by anyone but the cursed, and those who’ve previously borne the curse. (It only targets one person at a time.) It doesn’t run—it walks, stopping only when it’s in range for a vicious attack that leaves the victim’s limbs snapped, and their pelvises crushed by coital rage. It can’t open doors, but it knows how to knock. It’s the dark presence behind one of the more gripping horror movies of recent memory, as well as a fantastic argument for abstinence.The soundtrack is handled by Disasterpeace, aka Rich Vreeland, an electronic artist who’s best known for a series of video game soundtracks. It Follows is his first film score, and he’s worked diligently to build a cohesive world of ominous moods. There are several recurring motifs: a booming percussion that comes like the monster pounding on the door; a shrill klaxon signaling when danger is near; a pattern of corrupted synths chugging into motion like some futuristic train on its way to the junkyard. A window shatters. A cluster of digital hornets buzz and whine. A jet turbine spins into motion, the air supercharging to an agonizing din, only to die down and leave the room sapped of tension. It’s a score that announces when something is about to happen, only to suddenly upend expectations and leave the room on edge.It Follows wouldn’t exist without John Carpenter’s movies, and neither would the score. ""Title"" sounds like an update of Carpenter’s Halloween theme, as a lonely piano line is slowly enveloped by gothic dread. The melody is echoed on ""Detroit"", the arpeggiated tones brushing up against the sublime as the synthesizers drone from underneath. This is where you’d maybe dock Vreeland and the filmmakers a point for originality, except It Follows comes at a precarious moment for the American horror movie. Everything is either point-of-view or torture porn, and frankly, if someone wants mine a source as fertile as Halloween, they should go right ahead.Like all OSTs, It Follows makes the most sense when you’ve seen the movie it’s made for—and you should see it, especially if you can watch horror movies in genuine terror of what’s about to happen. But it can work in other contexts, and a quick scan of Vreeland’s work shows he isn’t a one-trick composer leaning on his Casio. I’m most familiar with his score for ""Fez"", a video game that’s ""Super Mario"" meets M.C. Escher, in which a pixellated alien explores a slowly decaying cartoon world. ""Fez"" is a playful, adventurous game in which a sense of whimsy is frequently juxtaposed with the solitude of the unknown. Vreeland’s score conveyed those moods, just as his work for It Follows captures the paranoid fervor aroused by finding your normally comfortable surroundings transformed into a danger zone. Is it your friend you’re looking at, or the monster? How about now?"
11700	9896	"
    I've seen a guide to the pronunciation of Gotye (""gore-ti-yeah"")
    and I'm still not sure I'm getting it right. In a lot of ways, it's a name built for the modern world-- difficult to say but extremely easy to search
    for on the Internet. Its very unpronuncability is what makes it stick in your
    brain. Gotye is one guy, Wally De Backer, who lives in Melbourne but originally
    hails from Belgium. He's a talented singer/songwriter/producer, emphasis on the
    singer part of that equation. His voice is precise yet malleable, running from
    smoothly soaring to roughly resigned, and his falsetto pierces like a light in
    the shadowy landscape of his music.
Like Drawing Blood, De Backer's second Gotye LP, is full of dark pop,
    produced with an open clarity that separates the numerous sounds and
    consequently comes off as huge and sweeping. There's a definite ring of the 80s
    to it as well, with its deliberate drum programming, big synth pads and
    romantic melodicism. I could see Peter Gabriel doing ""Night Drive""
    for sure, given the vaguely global tinge added by the hints of tamboura at the
    beginning and the piles of hand percussion that bubble up at the end.
    It's not the only feint toward worldbeat-- De Backer nods to Middle Eastern
    and South Asian modes and instrumentation on the opening verses of ""The
    Only Way"", both in his pentatonic vocal melody and the brief interrupting
    phrases played on a nasal instrument that sounds like a shenai but could just
    as easily be a synth or weirdly played sax. Horns play a big role in the
    album's most obvious single, the minor Aussie hit ""Learnalilgivinanlovin"",
    which opens with some pretty Spector-ish drums and launches into an insanely
    catchy tune backed with swelling horns and De Backer's many-tiered
    self-harmonizing. A baritone sax zigzags through the verses, teasing the vocals. It's a great song, even though it ends with a
    percussion solo.

    The other big standout-- ""Heart's a Mess""-- sounds a lot like its
    animated video looks. In the video, long-legged machine-creatures stalk a
    ravaged mechanical countryside in the moonlight and ultimately float off into
    space. A simple but effective organ figure balances De Backer's softly delivered
    verses with an off-kilter counterpart, egging him on to the song's climax, where he
    rises to a full shout on the lines ""It makes no sense/ But I'm desperate
    to connect."" Judging by the sounds here, the connection isn't going to
    happen anytime soon, and he'll probably be wandering in the moonlight for quite a
    while.

    By and large, Like Drawing Blood is at least close to this level, but
    I'm trying to figure out what happens in its last third. After the unexpected
    dub detour of ""Puzzle with a Piece Missing"", the album veers off
    course with ""A Distinctive Sound"", a sample-heavy DJ workout in the
    vein of the Avalanches and Amon Tobin. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's
    certainly incongruous and less satisfying and, ironically, also less distinct
    than De Backer's vocal turns. It's followed by a meandering, melodica-topped dub
    instrumental. While they won't send you running for the hills, the presence of
    these tracks is confusing, and it can't help feeling like they're shoved
    near the back of the running order for a reason.

    That doesn't make it a bad album, just a flawed one. At its worst, it feels
    like it's gone off on a tangent, but De Backer never fails to come back to his
    strengths, even if he sometimes takes a whole song to do it. On the whole, the
    balance comes out in his favor, and at its best, Like Drawing
    Blood is memorable and captivating.

7383	14650	"If you're putting together a rootsy indie folk band, I can understand choosing a name that involves animals. It makes you sound pantheistic and totally in tune with nature, yet also more primal and badass than if you'd just invoked trees or rivers or something.  So-- Fleet Foxes, Band of Horses, Grizzly Bear, Department of Eagles-- I get it. But the Moondoggies? Really? Doesn't this name sound like it'd belong to a group of genial, balding, middle-aged dudes singing jokey songs about life on the prairie? Something not too far removed from the Gourds maybe?Nope, the Moondoggies actually have far more in common with those aforementioned, better-named bands, making a manful, harmony-heavy brand of Americana rock modeled after fragile but forceful legends Neil Young, the Band, and the Grateful Dead. Tidelands, by contrast, finds the Moondoggies (and particularly lead singer Kevin Murphy) admirably striving to find their own voice, yet it's frequently a more crabbed and deliberate album than its predecessor. In other words, a quintessential example of artistic growing pains.The Moondoggies, like indie-folk leading lights Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, draw great strength from their vocal harmonies. In the Moondoggies' case, these harmonies frequently take on a gospel tinge, and they're intrinsic to the success of all of Tidelands' best songs. But unlike those freak-folk-friendly acts, these guys don't really isolate their harmonies or deploy them in unexpected places, instead tying them down pretty firmly to trad-rock strictures.That's not to say this strategy can't be effective-- for proof, look no further than the churning, prophetic title track, the Music From Big Pink doppelgänger ""What Took So

9443	12539	"Move D and Benjamin Brunn's Songs from the Beehive counts as one of the year's most idiosyncratic electronic releases. A collaboration between Germans David Moufang (Move D) and Brunn, Songs overlaps little with signpost trends of the past few years, instead grasping for the type of been-there thwump-and-click so familiar you'll struggle to find a buzz-word buzzier than ""techno."" Drawing on almost all of its creators' past dalliances-- trip-hop, trance, minimal, dub, ambient-- Songs is an album that constantly whispers in your year, sometimes literally, and builds damp, murky headspaces out of its elliptical grooves.That Songs trends towards the classic techno sounds shouldn't come as a huge surprise: Moufang has been an underground favorite since the early 1990s and Brunn has been releasing singles since 1999. And while this review is a little late on the come-up, make no mistake: Songs marks something of a breakthrough for Brunn and especially Moufang, the type of album that makes even electronic junkies-- those who have long praised Moufang's catalogue-- sit up and notice. Songs consists of seven long-form tracks, most of which aim to soundtrack the soft-palate dancefloor in the back of your head. ""Love the One You're With"" encapsulates this cloistered clubby-ness, opening Songs with a chopped vocal sample and slow-change synth notes. A rhythmic chirp, stunted bass sequence, and spacey, panning notes are introduced slowly, like how an innertube sits motionless for a few moments as the motorboat tenses the line.  The ingredients undoubtedly sound familiar, but Brunn and Moufang make subtle upgrades: The high-pitched chirp that anchors the track sounds like an insect, while the clipped vocals are indecipherable speech, not song.""Love the One You're With"" is the first of three long tracks to open Songs, which gives the opening 40 minutes of the album a hazy, marathon feel. ""Honey"" ramps up the fastest, beginning with skittish bass notes before Moufang and Brunn coax out a quick 4/4 kick. The track is an exercise in tempo: Long ambient drones contrast with flurries of rainbow notes and taut rhythms. ""Velvet Paws"" searches purposefully without ever wandering, as Moufang and Brunn tend to the track's early morning orbits with patient, veteran fingers.The prize at the end of the three-headed marathon is Songs' most singular track, ""Like a Restless Sea"", which loops a whispered refrain-- ""The wind that moves the trees like a restless sea""-- over distended, subtly rhythmic keyboard noise. Indeed, most of the motion in the track is provided by its hushed voice-- a stressed syllable on ""rest"" serves as the track's tether-- and the result sounds like Moufang and Brunn singing a lullaby to house music.Album closer ""Radar"", clocking in at nearly 21 minutes, sounds forward and flirtatious, a bulbous, trance-y floor-filler that dissipates into murky, rhythmic clatter and one miniature, exhilarated voice. Moufang and Brunn have long proved themselves bright, dedicated composers, but Songs represents a new high for both: a careful, vibrant long-player from two unheralded 12"" warriors that should make thoughts and soles move with equal grace."

    Bun B is a solo artist not by choice but by necessity. After spending a decade and a half in the legendary Texas rap duo UGK, Bun found himself all alone in 2002, when Pimp C, his partner, went to prison on a parole-violation charge. With Pimp gone, Bun hit the guest appearance circuit hard and eventually released Trill, his decent-enough 2005 solo debut. At the tail end of 2005, Pimp came home, and the reunited duo crafted the triumphant double album Underground Kingz. One of the few truly feel-good comeback stories in rap was cut short this past December when Pimp died from complications of sleep apnea. A few months later, Bun returns to the solo slog. If nothing else, II Trill makes for a great story of personal resilience.
    Bun B is one of the South's great rap voices: He has a gravelly depth-charge snarl that belies a rapid-fire bounce-rap delivery and always finds a way to effortlessly blend with even the most complicated drum patterns. But solo Bun will never work anywhere near as well as UGK did. In UGK, Pimp's nasal libertine honk played counterpoint to Bun's authoritative rumble, and Pimp's crushingly humid country-funk beats gave Bun's voice focus and direction. And Pimp or no Pimp, the 2008 Bun is nowhere near as ecstatically word-drunk as he once was; no line on II Trill rivals this astoundingly awesome boast from 2001's ""Wood Wheel"": ""Smoking on bionic bubonic chronic, it's so ironic/ Sipping gin and tonic, supersonic like Johnny Mnemonic."" The Bun we hear on II Trill is weirdly workmanlike, a technical beast without a whole lot to say beyond obligatory lines about his realness.
    Throughout II Trill, Bun largely ignores the tragic context surrounding the album, preferring instead to lock into his time-tested lyrical tropes; the small army of guest-rappers on the album mentions Pimp more often than Bun does. Along with the booty-clap club-track ""Pop It 4 Pimp"", the only Pimp C eulogy here is ""Angel in the Sky"", a toothless rap&b lament. Back on the first Trill, Bun spent six minutes on ""The Story"" directly and candidly detailing UGK's history over a hard beat without letting a chorus interrupt him. Touching as it might be, ""Angel in the Sky"" has none of that scope or specificity. Instead, Bun sounds like he's trying to cope with loss by getting back to business as usual, an understandable response but not one that makes for a terribly compelling end-to-end listen.
    And yet II Trill is still a stronger album than its predecessor, largely because its producers keep things cohesive, doing their best to stay within Pimp's organic-thump blueprint, and because the guest rappers here seem to realize they're on tracks with Bun B and that they have to step their shit up accordingly. On ""Damn I'm Cold"", which should've been the first single, Bun and Lil Wayne trade wicked punchlines over Chops' swampy blues-guitar noodles and screaming organs. ""Swang on Em"" brings martial snares, horns, and a surprisingly slippery fake-Southern Lupe Fiasco cameo. On ""Get Cha Issue"", Bun uses Bigg Tyme's grimy chopped-up bar-rock track to momentarily depart from his standard block-talk, kicking nebulously political end-times proclamations (addressing elected leaders: ""Y'all some liars, stealers, philanderers and all/ Got senators sucking dick inside of bathroom stalls""). But nothing sounds as great as ""Underground Thang"", where Pimp C's disembodied voice returns, bringing with it the group chemistry and the guttural asshole charisma missing elsewhere.
    With its near-endless running-time and its occasional misguided bids for radio-play (the thoroughly meh Sean Kingston-assisted single ""That's Gangsta"" springs to mind), II Trill feels like a throwback to a time when record labels were actually willing to devote resources toward recording and promoting rap albums. As such, it never quite works as a cohesive statement. But anyone expecting a world-conquering classic like UGK's 1996 Ridin' Dirty is demanding too much. II Trill is a solid and occasionally great record, an album more directed toward car-stereo utility than bedroom contemplation. At this point in his career, Bun's more than earned the right to crank out records like this whenever he wants.

2869	19675	"Few releases have so effectively shrugged at the supposed dichotomy of “alternative” and “traditional” R&B over the past few years than Late Nights with Jeremih, the free mixtape from Jeremih that quietly grew to be a cult favorite after dropping from left field in 2012. And anyway, that binary—which took real shape around 2011, thanks in large part to the clamor around the Weeknd’s landmark debut, House of Balloons—has always been more about the audience than about the artist. There are vague aesthetic similarities among R&B artists pegged as “alternative” (or otherwise)—a focus on vibe over narrative, a tendency to distort vocals to the point of disembodiment—but what it more often designates is a certain seal of approval, a go-ahead for guilt-free consumption by whatever your term of choice may be for those who’ve warmed to R&B in the 2010s but approach the bulk of the genre under the protective cloak of irony.Late Nights, at once radio-driven and experimental, shared some of those aesthetics but managed to duck that conversation so thoroughly that it made you question if the conversation was worth having to begin with. Its oddness was approachable from all angles, as Jeremih and a league of ambitious producers (Mike WiLL Made It in his absolute prime, pop soothsayer Tricky Stewart, occasionally Jeremih himself) took cues from the sounds of the underground but never quite presented them as “cool.” All this was especially surprising coming from the guy best known for “Birthday Sex”, a doofy novelty hit that’s endured solely because people continue to  have birthdays. But even then, there were glimmers of promise: in a 2009 acoustic performance of the same song, he transformed it into something intimate and feather-light, accompanying himself on piano.When Jeremih initially linked last year with moody L.A. producer Shlohmo for Yours Truly and Adidas Originals’ Songs From Scratch series, it wasn’t such an improbable pairing: here was a singer willing to go all in with producers’ stranger impulses working with a beatmaker that possesses omnivorous tendencies, whose gooey sad-boy soundscapes draw from ghostly R&B balladry, abstracted hip-hop percussion, and hissy ambience alike. (The first half of last year’s Laid Out EP could, with very slight stretches of the imagination, be considered some warped form of R&B itself.) That collaboration, “Bo Peep (Do U Right)"", was proof enough: gorgeously smoggy, humid, and sort of tragic despite the surface romance, with Jeremih’s weightless falsetto piercing through the groaning bassline, “Wish somebody would’ve seen us, baby.” It was heavier than Jeremih’s usual stuff, but it worked, at least as a one-off. A year later, the duo aim to replicate its magic on No More, their six-track collaboration; but where Jeremih floated on “Bo Peep,” the majority of the EP falls flat.Shlohmo’s productions are typically dense and blurry, his bittersweet melodies rendered in smudgy sepia tones and built from intricately arranged layers of what sound like organized anxieties. When there are vocals, they’re often samples; even when they’re not, as with “Don’t Say No”, his lovely 2013 collaboration with How to Dress Well, vocals tend to serve as yet another instrument in the mix, rather than the focal point. Though “Bo Peep” proved an exception, Jeremih’s voice isn’t intended for this sort of environment; there’s a translucency to his falsetto that radiates when given the proper space, but gets bogged down by too much outside noise.Late Night’s best moments— “773 Love,” “Fuck U All The Time,” “Go To The Mo”—shared a certain sense of delicacy, their productions defined primarily by negative space. No More could benefit from some of this airiness; instead, it often feels stifling, Jeremih’s voice mired in the layers of hi-hat twitches and bass grumblings. Title track “No More” burbles and quivers yet doesn’t quite move in any particular direction. “Let It Go” is pretty—it’s certainly the best new song on the project—but ultimately reads as a slightly subpar cousin to “Bo Peep”. And when the duo aim for sparseness, on skeletal closing track “The End,” they’re left with a handful of parts and not much whole; Jeremih’s a touch off-key and slightly out of time, and a tacked-on appearance from Chance the Rapper is a bizarre choice for a finale, entirely at odds with the warm, woozy sensuality of the preceding tracks.Most questionable here is the inclusion of Shlohmo’s “Fuck U All the Time” remix, the original version of which he released well before the two ever crossed paths. It’s essentially just an extended version of the original, which boasts an additional Jeremih verse packed with mildly cute, mostly embarrassing lines like, “Don’t let the time ticky-icky-icky while I’m snapping off your bra/ And biting on your Vickies.” Moments like that are forgivable, if a bit dorky (and it’s far from the first remix of the song crammed with superfluous verses), but it’s harder to understand the impulse to improve upon a song that draws seductiveness from subtlety by piling more stuff on top—that familiar moaning bassline, those little beeps and clatters. It’s that same impulse that characterizes much of the past few years of so-called alt-R&B: pile on the effects, pitch down the voice, and let 'er rip. That impulse holds No More back from approaching the transcendence of Jeremih and Shlohmo’s first collaboration (or most of Late Nights): too much of the EP feels like a drawn-out remix of a song that didn’t really need it in the first place."
17416	6664	"Radioinactive is a guy, not a group.  He hails from Los Angeles, and dabbles in
    a genre he calls ""avant hip-hop.""  ""Avant,"" in this context (as with most other
    indie usages of the word) is merely a euphemism.  One may use the word as a
    synonym for ""cutting edge,"" as its technical definition is ""culturally or
    stylistically advanced.""  But musically, ""avant"" has come to imply brazen
    abnormality over the years.  Dumb the music down and it just becomes plain
    weird.  So, in essence, Radioinactive makes ""weird hip-hop.""  Or maybe one
    would do better just to call it weird, and forget the hip-hop part.

    But that wouldn't exactly be fair; if there's one thing I associate with hip-hop,
    it's the beats, and Radioinactive definitely has those.  His beats fit the
    ""avant"" label, avoiding pop, funk or fusion samples-- hard break beats, horn
    sections and thumping, subterranean basslines make but a few appearances on
    Pyramidi. Instead, Radio culls samples from the nocturnal subcultures of
    the world; the title track placed me in a Moroccan brothel (supposing brothels
    exist in Morocco), ""Una Cosa"" in a smoky Havana nightclub, ""Childish"" on the
    weekend streets of Kingston. The dominant motif is darkness-- not anger or
    aggression, but a relaxed, cool musical presence.  And as a contrast to most
    other hip-hop artists, I can't imagine hearing Radioinactive coming out of a
    Lincoln Navigator with deep dish rims, tinted windows and a dope ""system."" This
    stuff seems a little too exotic for the pimps and players.

    The rhymes are another matter. Radio has an interesting free-flowing,
    halfway-to-helium delivery that sometimes matches his beats, but at others
    sounds superfluous and distracts from the groove. His rambling writing style
    just lacks precision.  It borders on free association, or some sort of partially
    calculated freestyle, and the loose approach, mixed with the tempo, results in
    enough words to fill a 20-page thesis. With so many lyrics, whatever message
    Radio wants to get across is severely diluted.

    There's an adage that says the best bassists ""know how to play the rests."" MCs
    aren't much different. Two of the best examples for any MC to learn from are
    Rakim and Kool G Rap.  Like Radioinactive, each preferred to rap at quick tempos,
    but they excelled by knowing when to shut up and let the breaks take the
    foreground, or just resting on a beat to punctuate a lyric (""I can take a phrase
    that's rarely heard/ [pause]/ Flip it/ [pause]/ Now it's a daily
    word,"" from Rakim's ""Follow the Leader""). Radio doesn't play with dynamics
    enough, even when he's got a good beat to work with, like on the title track.
    Another example is the Arabian-flavored ""Before the Thought,"" where Radio gets
    stuck in a noticeable vocal cadence, which is odd, considering his rhymes and
    meter are rarely predictable.  Fortunately, the backing track overpowers the
    unrelenting lyrical assault, making the song enjoyable regardless of its
    difficulties.

    Radioinactive is at his lyrical best on ""The Music,"" which is also one of the
    more traditional hip-hop tracks, and the one with the stiffest breakbeat. He
    sounds a lot like Del here, especially when he's varying his vocal inflection
    to deliver lyrics like, ""Down your sink/ Down your drain/ Found your brain
    underground/ With a plunger found right next to it/ Add some text to it/ Add
    some facts/ Ask your Dad for the keys and plan to never give them back."" Moments
    like these are not common enough on Pyramidi, and require patience to
    discover; the album spans 30 tracks and 71 minutes, including a good deal of
    random vignettes and minute-or-less musical interludes.

    It's nice to hear hip-hop that doesn't conjure too many memories of A Tribe
    Called Quest, Gang Starr or Brand Nubian, as many underground artists do these
    days. But prescience and creativity give way to overkill and lack of execution
    on this one. If Radioinactive can clean up his act (maybe bury some of the waste
    in a Nevada mountainside or something), he has the potential to make some pretty
    wicked albums. This one might even be worth owning just for its distinctiveness."
11274	10343	"Two Gallants are no strangers to controversy. What the Toll
    Tells, their 2006 debut for Saddle Creek, included ""Long Summer Day"",
    a song written from the perspective of a slave, which raised issues of
    racism and misappropriation, including from Pitchfork reviewer Brian Howe.
    Then, while playing a show last fall in Houston, the San Francisco duo had an
    unfortunate run-in with the police that ended in violence and arrest.
    Their ultimately triumphant legal battles and hectic tour schedule left Adam Stephens and Tyson
    Vogel little time to craft a proper full-length (one is due out in
    September), so in the meantime they've recorded some acoustic tracks at sound checks and
    radio appearances.

    The Scenery of Farewell is a different direction for the
    usually raucous TG, who've earned comparisons to a Southern
    White Stripes or an American Pogues by dragging ratty garage-punk
    through the muddy country. Instead, their more intimate, stripped-down
    approach (including flourishes of piano and various string instruments
    like cello, double, bass, and violin) likens them more to roots
    rockers like the Jayhawks and the Avett Brothers, along with nods to
    acoustic Neil Young and the Band.
    Many of the EP's themes are about life on the road, alienation, and
    loneliness, the struggle to keep long distance (geographical and
    emotional) relationships going and when to say goodbye to them. String-drenched opener ""Seems Like Home to Me"" is a weary lament
    about a woman with oceans for eyes. ""Lady"" goes ""where the hobos sleep""
    and admits to ""count[ing] my thoughts with coffee spoons."" The strings
    and harmonicas of ""Up the Country"" lament, ""I've seen salvation's yard
    but every highwayman's been barred."" ""All Your Faithless Loyalties""
    is an early Dylan-styled kiss-off akin to ""It Ain't Me Babe"". With the
    piano ballad closer, ""Linger"", it's hard to tell if they are men in
    love or men at war. Love is a battlefield, after all.

    While the intimate settings give Two Gallants a different palette for
    themselves and their fans, as well as a spotlight on their literate
    lyrics, the songs are a little too similar sounding. The Scenery
    of Farewell is a decent lazy summer listen, but it doesn't leave a lasting
    impression and is probably not enough to convert anyone who isn't
    already a fan. In turning down the volume, the band
    loses much of its unique personality, love it or hate it.

12288	9335	"
    Before his untimely passing this year, Detroit producer and MC J Dilla had established himself as one of hip-hop's most reliable auteurs. ""He didn't overthink things,"" said Karriem Riggins, whom Dilla enlisted to finish the nearly completed The Shining shortly before his death, to the Detroit Free Press. Dilla's knack for intuitive and engaging beats served MCs well: His lucid, live-instrument-and-breakbeat-intensive production is synonymous with socially conscious rap's 1990s heyday-- a milieu on which Dilla left huge footprints with production credits on staples like the Pharcyde's Labcabincalifornia, A Tribe Called Quest's Beats, Rhymes and Life, and De La Soul's Stakes Is High.
    Yet his prevailing focus on soulful, dynamic listenability instead of jazzbo hokum (let us pass over Common's Electric Circus in silence) instilled a durability in his music that allowed it to survive the seismic shifts in aesthetics that rocked hip-hop over the past decade. Despite the erratic quality of his own group Slum Village's output, Dilla's consistently sharp production kept the flame alive for the soul-jacking, pop-friendly rap that would enjoy a resurgence with recently influential records by Common and Kanye West.
    A good hook, in other words, never goes out of style, and in a rap climate broad enough to allow for everything from deep-space funk to minimal snap music, Dilla's classicism acts as a control group amid more exotic strains. His other 2006 release, Donuts, with its profusion of brief instrumentals, was his record for heads-- a glorified beat tape that put the raw stuff of his vision on enticing display. In contrast, The Shining is more of a general audience record, by virtue of its song-length tracks and pervasive vocals from Dilla and his crew. As such, it presents challenges that Donuts didn't.

    On a beat tape, you can make your point in a few bars and move on to the next boom-bap, but an album wants structure and continuity. Dilla imposed this structure upon The Shining by two primary methods, with varying levels of success. The first was by cultivating a sense of unified variety, and this is where The Shining truly excels-- it's a great digest of Dilla's various moods and modes. We get sumptuous neo-soul: ""Love"" recreates the Impressions' ""We Must Be in Love"" as a crackling swoon punched up with hearty brass, while ""Baby"" uses sped-up infant samples as bold, primary-color accents for its supple pastels. We get vertiginous, Madlib-esque fire: ""Geek Down"" weaves a sinister net of thunderclap drums, weird wavering bass, demonic incantation, and a dominant line like a sliced-up kazoo; the rock-solid stomp of ""E=MC2"" radiates as variegated vocoder textures swell and decay. And we get straight-up trunk-rattle: ""Jungle Love"" laces wowing sirens over skeletal trash-compacter percussion, while ""Body Movin'"" carves up a cymbal-heavy wash with off-kilter squelch and abrupt vocal drops.

The Shining's second layer of structural integrity resides in the guest vocals that dominate the album. Many of the record's guests also rose to prominence in the 1990s, though none of them remind us how much hip-hop has changed since then more starkly than Busta Rhymes: The guy who once had one of the most bugged-out flows in rap squanders ""Geek Down"" with thuggish, boring ad-libs that pay homage to the ""fucking godfather Dilla"" while contradicting the essence of his playful spirit. Common fares a bit better on ""E=MC2"", dropping innocuous party raps into the tight slots between the scratches and drums. He's equally passable sparring gently with the always sublime D'Angelo on ""So Far to Go"", which sports the sort of inventively dreamy yet perfectly coherent landscape Dilla also showed off on Steve Spacek's ""Dollar"", reminding us that the producer was as good with r&b atmosphere as he was with rap thwack (he makes Dwele sound way better than he has any right to on the ""Dime Piece"" remix). MED and Guilty Simpson spit nails that are well-suited to the junkyard jangle of ""Jungle Love"", while Black Thought mounts a commanding presence amid the overlapping click-tracks of ""Love Movin'"". Dilla embeds his own utilitarian rhymes in the deep digital swirls of ""Won't Do"", and while they don't add much force to the track, they pretty much stay out of the way.

    Staying out of the way was one of Dilla's assets-- one hears his productions, first and foremost, as songs, not as stylized renditions of his brand. This is why his music is at once so enduringly listenable and why it never fully cracked a mainstream obsessed with personality and trademarked tics-- Dilla's trademark was self-effacement in the service of the groove. The mainstream wanted him, but he mostly didn't want it, preferring to work with friends and kindred spirits, admitting as much with the sample that closes out ""Baby"": ""How do I feel about radio hip-hop? I think it's wack. Most of the shit they play is straight garbage."" Whether or not one agrees with the sentiment is beside the point in the context of The Shining-- it's simply an expression of Dilla's steadfast commitment to his own vision amid the shifting tides of rap culture at large.

7437	14631	"When the Vaselines reunited a couple of years ago, they didn't pretend they had much to add to what they'd accomplished in the late 1980s: two EPs and a brief album, all of them brisk, frothy, wittily stupid, magnificently hooky, and horny enough to shatter granite. But their reunion also seemed like a ""fuck it, why not?"" move. The Glasgow-based duo of Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly were never exactly careerists-- it's not their problem that Nirvana covered three of their songs-- and their 2008-2009 tour seemed like a one-off frolic rather than any kind of commitment or cash-in.Yet here they are again, backed up by members of Belle and Sebastian and the 1990s, and produced by Jamie Watson (who recorded them the first time around, too). The album's got a cute title, with the double meaning of ""check out how hot we are"" and ""hooking up again with the person you used to date."" Almost any of these simple two-riff, verse-chorus songs would have made a perfectly acceptable addition to their original records (and they're better than anything either Kelly or McKee has come up with since they broke up); in particular, ""I Hate the 80's"" is a welcome bit of grumpy oldsterism and ""Turning It On"" is built on juicy love/hate sentiments. The band's twanging, strummy arrangements and McKee and Kelly's bedroom-eyed thrust-and-parry are exactly like they were the first time around.That's what's disconcerting about Sex with an X. Significant artistic development of any kind probably would've been a bad idea for this band-- they were, as the saying goes, small but perfectly formed. Still, it's also not quite satisfying to hear 40-year-olds come back to what they were doing half their lifetime ago and approach it exactly the same way. Pretend the album was recorded at the same sessions as 1989's Dum-Dum, and it's a kick. But it wasn't.It's instructive to compare the Vaselines to the Pastels, their contemporaries and scenemates (with whom Kelly also played). The Pastels also started off with a focus on untamed youth and speed and simplicity, and gradually came to abandon all of those things in favor of what made them distinctive: the chalk and grit of their voices and the smoky drift of their songs. Kelly and McKee, on the other hand, treat the Vaselines as a vehicle for a particular sound and attitude. They've got their formula, and they're sticking to it, whether or not it's got anything more to yield. ""Feels so good it must be bad for me/ Let's do it, let's do it again,"" they sing on the title track. They know perfectly well that what they're doing is retrograde and maybe even beneath them, and it's hard to blame them, because it's the best they've ever had anyway."

    ""It was so f'in precious."" So went a lyric from Cloud Cult's last studio LP, 2007's The Meaning Of 8, and it could've been the understatement of the year.  Nearly everything about the group is so admirable (their studio runs on geothermal power) or adorable (live painter onstage?!?!), that you could feel comfortable nominating them for public office or writing about them only in LOLCAT speak.  But while 8 wasn't exactly an epic fail, it was curiously underwhelming; pre-leak hype suggested that it would push these industrious Minnesotans to the upper echelon of blog hosannas and year-end top tens that they seemed perfectly constructed for, but it just sort of deflated upon touchdown.  But Cloud Cult have developed a self-sufficiency that allows them to exist almost totally outside indie's name-making machinery; simply put, they don't need the help, seeing as how whatever happens, they'll just keep doing what they do, free of the temptation to compromise their lofty ambitions.
    So, as expected, Cloud Cult keep it moving with their eighth album in as many years, but Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes) is a pretty marked departure from their previous records. Considering that they've got their aesthetic down pat (a sort of post-Beck kitchen sink alt-rock matched with the 21st-century quasi-religious collectives), it's got nothing to do with sonics, however.  Their last two LP's combined to clock in at more than 120 minutes over the span of 44 tracks, but this time, they've damn near put out an EP-- 39 over 13. This would initially seem like a smart move, but sprawl is every bit as essential to what they do as capo Craig Minowa's warble; paddling through all the extraneous dross was part (or most) of the fun.  Unfortunately, their batting average is far lower here, magnifying all the nagging problems they've compiled to date.  The title rings true, as the contents of Feel Good Ghosts are effusive, but invertebrate.
    Essentially, this is where the insularity finally catches up.  At the very least, ""No One Said it Would Be Easy"" begins Feel Good Ghosts with beautifully panned piano, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most empathetic-- ""You're a pretty human being...living, it ain't easy""-- but overzealous studio treatment has Minowa sounding like Jeremy Enigk drowning in a jar of Smuckers.  And then there's ""Love You All"", which ends Feel Good Ghosts with the scent of an acid-washed power ballad, expressing the type of sentiments that are uncut Cloud Cult at their most cloying. Minowa offers ""I love you""'s to his mother and father but does so through a fucking talkbox, which either undermines the emotion or completely cancels it out.

    In between, Feel Good Ghosts too often comes off like hamburger phone transmissions from the Juno-verse, force-feeding knotty or naughty feelings through a filter of whimsy. ""Story of the Grandson of Jesus"", in addition to mining the same territory as 8's ""Alien Christ"", relates the story of a false prophet with a ""penchant for the pinchies,"" offering ""cola and Twinkies."" Meanwhile, ""Journey of the Featherless"" gives you an idea of what an unplugged Her Space Holiday might sound like, impotently namechecking cellphones and eBay as if they're pillars of modern evil after Minowa dispenses a K.I.T. senior yearbook koan-- ""It's worth dreaming just for the dream of it.""   The group's always had a predilection for the boomin' system in their drum machines, but ""The Tornado Lessons"" is finally where Minowa tries his hand at the rap game.  I'll let you guess how that turns out.

    I really wanted to see ""May Your Hearts Stay Strong"" succeed more than it does, as it features one of Feel Good Ghost's most arresting arrangements of machinery clanks and dramatic keyboards, and suggests that Cloud Cult might be willing to strip away their shiny happy defense mechanisms.  But nothing about the shadowy love affair described therein feels real-- a nightclub owner who ""got his first stitches when he bit an ice cream bowl"" falls for a girl who ""wore her grandma's prom dress and slippers on her feet.""  Instead of letting the characters just be, they have to be characters instead, and lyrically, Minowa just sounds out of his element, similar to when he laments ""all the poop that brings me down"" over the oontz-oontzing fake disco of ""Hurricane And Fire Survival Guide"".

    I'll admit, it's hard not to root for these guys, considering that they mean so well. Minowa will likely always have Cloud Cult as a means to therapeutically address the death of his infant son, and then there's this from the band's website: ""We also plant ten trees for every 1,000 albums sold just to be sure any other pollutants are absorbed. We have turned away major record label interests so we can be sure we can maintain control of providing Cloud Cult music in the most environmentally friendly manner possible.""

    How can I tell you not to spend the ten bucks?  But you don't need a Mclusky primer to tell you that good intentions can only go so far and Feel Good Ghosts repeatedly fails to meet the listener halfway; Minowa hasn't run out of things to say, but he's having trouble coming up with new ways to say them, and Feel Good Ghosts unfortunately feels like another byproduct of Cloud Cult's recycling process.

681	22024	“Supergroup” is a flawed term, implying a Justice League of musicians banding together to use their powers for good. Most newly minted collaborations shy away from its grandiose implications (and perhaps you'd be right to suspect the motives of any who didn't). In reality, these projects often start from much smaller stakes: a chance to escape your natural creative instincts, and ultimately better understand them.The debut album by k.d. lang, Neko Case, and Laura Veirs has been compared to Trio, the 1987 effort from Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris, and the parallel makes sense in a way—there are few precedents for female solo artists banding together, and Americana is the black sheep on country’s family tree. But the titular Trio were at the height of their commercial powers in the late 1980s. Although titans in their respective fields, case/lang/veirs aren't really capitalizing on anything here. lang met Case and Veirs after she moved to Portland, and thought they’d be perfect for the punky girl group she wanted to form. She emailed them, simply stating, “I think we should make a record.” Within half an hour, they had both replied saying yes.Rather than bring finished songs to the studio, they honored the spirit of collaboration, with Veirs and lang taking the bulk of the work, and Case, who lives primarily in Vermont, joining them when she could. These are three of the strongest voices in their field—lang the full-voiced seductress, Case the hurricane, and Veirs the wry storyteller—so things could easily have become overcrowded. Instead, they give each other space to take the lead on group-authored material, which wound up veering from lang’s original punk Ronettes template in favor of dusky songs about devotion, heartache, and awe at the simple power of human connection and creativity—the kind that underpins a project like this. “I Want to Be Here” is one of a few songs written by all three musicians, and finds them praising a misfit artist friend who “lost a front tooth, can’t keep a job,” Veirs sings, reassuring them, “but the things you make are so beautiful / They bring me joy / Don’t you ever stop.” Singing as a meditative campfire choir, they avow that “the hungry fools who rule the world can’t catch us / Surely they can’t ruin everything.”case/lang/veirs makes a few subtle political statements about the human cost of being an artist. “Our life savings aren’t enough / Have to love you hard and make it up, make it up,” Case sings on realist heartbreaker “Supermoon,” where strings and the odd rumble of thunder lend forlorn drama to a heavily thumbed acoustic guitar. Veirs’ “Song for Judee” gives dignity to the late singer-songwriter Judee Sill, elucidating the harsh realities of her life with empathy and warmth. They dismiss preconceptions about youth determining the value of women artists on “Atomic Number,” dividing the opening lines into a three-part sunrise. “I’m not the freckled maid / I’m not the fair-haired girl / I’m not a pail of milk for you to spoil,” they declare, as pattering percussion pushes their elegy for innocence into a golden chorus. “Why are the wholesome things the ones we make obscene?” Case asks later on.Although lang has said they didn’t start with a theme, much of case/lang/veirs stems from this idea of relationships as wholesome forces. More than once, the presence of someone else is a revivifying power, peeling whoever’s singing away from the ledge, up off the rug. And despite each artist’s unique individual approach, they share a sensory approach to singing about these intimacies that’s completely intoxicating and oftentimes driven by natural imagery (like much of Case's best work). “Why does the heart of the flame burn blue? / Why do January cherries bloom? / Why do blue fires burn in me, yet not in you?” lang croons over tumbling jazz piano on “Blue Fires.” Case’s “Delirium” takes place in bed, her sleeping lover’s skin smelling like fireworks. The “Greens of June” flood in and make Veirs “want to live like I never have before,” while “laundry on the line, truckers passing on the right” remind Case of all the beauty there is to live for, driving “Down I-5” with her shoulder burning in the window.Loveliest of all is lang’s “Honey and Smoke,” where she watches other people fawning over her lover—“I watch as they pour honey in your ear”—with confident devotion. It’s a dreamy western slow dance, until lang too is overcome by infatuation. “Unaware of just how beautiful you are from within / Uncontainable / Exquisite to the detail / It hypnotizes people / Robs them of their social graces / Swarming to your glow / Fanning with phrases,” she sings with rapt intensity, losing her cool for a moment and showing her hand. Even when they sing about being emotionally closed-off, on “Behind the Armory,” they can’t help but make it beautiful: “Flies in amber / Sand in soap / Air trapped in the glass,” Case yearns.The sweetness of their gaze only makes the melodies on case/lang/veirs seem more familiar, resonating deep within some distant memory while still sounding fresh. The hooks are mostly vocal-led, but producer Tucker Martine and the small band of players (including Glenn Kotche on percussion) color them perfectly. In “Best Kept Secret,” Veirs calls on a friend in California to lighten her mood, accompanied by a gold-rush fanfare of horns and guitars. Woodwind tentatively dots the edges of “1000 Miles Away,” where lang anguishes about the distance between her and the woman standing right next to her. “Why Do We Fight” finds elegance in defeat, lang questioning the point of “spit and punches” amid streams of pedal steel and soft piano. The attention to detail is just as evident in the small production touches—the subtle plucks and scrapes that make these songs feel lived-in and alive, like the barely perceptible mechanical glimmer that gilds the edge of the steady fingerpicked pulse in “I Want to Be Here,” or the muted line of firecrackers that skitters down the chorus of “Honey and Smoke.”What are the stakes with a collaborative record like this? It probably won’t yield a follow-up, but it’d be a gift if it did. None of the participants had suffered a lapse in her powers and needed reviving, though the newsworthiness of the collaboration should hopefully introduce a generation of listeners to their respective deep catalogues (particularly lang's). case/lang/veirs isn’t a springboard or a resting place—it's a tribute to connection, communion, and reflection on the things that bind us. And it feels particularly significant and sanctuary-like for the fractured times that we live in. “I just want, I wanna be here with you,” they sing in unison. “Not bracing for what comes next.”
14655	387	"I have a friend.  Since he's fictional, I call him as I wish: Marshall.  Well, Marshall has a few hang-ups,
    one of which is Barsuk Records.  He can't forgive them for unveiling Death Cab's white-collared weeping on
    the world.  He curses their blue-eyed histrionics in a well-lubed monologue.  The age-old frailty, thy name
    is Gibbard diatribe.  Marshall un-surprised me earlier this week when I put on one of Barsuk's latest releases
    and he started sputtering again.  Goth is the new glam; it's our generation's adopted grunge; c'est le nouveau
    garage.  That Marshall.  He's so coy when alliterative.

    But he's right.  On their second release, Battery, the Seattle quartet Aveo has Phil Ek manning
    the boards again, and the results, while perhaps more wide-sprung, sound all-too familiar.  Time,
    that ever-degrading barometer for pop music, has caught up with them.  In 2001, their Brit-derived
    goth-punk was just gaining a foothold and still felt like a novel reinvention; now, its dreary slog is as
    commonplace as three-chord punk after the millennium's turn.

    Still, if the timing is a bit suspect (and, remember:  this is their second album), technically, Aveo prove
    sure-handed purveyors of sounds never far gone from pop.  Woking, Surrey and all of its punchdrunk-Who-punk
    of the late 70s is ably represented, just as surely as those indie-darlings The Smiths and The Cure.  Cranky
    guitars grind against the sedate echolalia of these harmonies, and they occasionally manage to enfold you in
    prickly gossamer.  When it works (""The Idiot on the Bike""), rudeboys and marble-eyed teens in thick-eyeliner
    exist in a tense, unshown turmoil where the chords laid out for each join without dissent.

    But most of the time, their discord seems falsely summoned, as though choreographed for a fight scene where
    fists sweep three feet of air and never smack chin.  Marshall calls it Chicken Little Fright.  He might say
    that music this oppressive needs room to suffocate itself.  On Battery, Aveo poke just enough holes
    through their thick guitars and smoky atmospheres to let in unwanted air.  You're never stifled or left to
    gasp, and so when the dense, grimy textures they're creating fail, you hear only their Cleaveresque veneer.

    The album's centerpiece, ""Fistfights with Mr. G"", offers the ideal illustration of these pitfalls.  After
    building a candlewaxed ballad up from the ground, lead singer William Wilson uncurls the line, ""I'll take
    him with one kick between his bony thighs.""  Marshall and I exchange a giggle.  Actually, we keep rewinding
    the song to that point and joining in with our Fraggle Rock falsettos.  The song's labyrinthine
    guitar work and pulsing keyboards crumble underneath this odd disjunction between hymnal sentience and
    kick-in-the-craw lyricism.  It's somewhat like Frank Zappa fronting Joy Division, ""Mudshark"" grunted out
    atop ""Disorder"".  Confusion settles in, but here it has no recourse to the musical buzzword of the last
    two years: irony.  Instead, it's impotent with cheap fuck-the-man irreverence, and ""Mr. G"" lays down limp
    and stringbeaned atop the song's now-lost transcendence.

    As Battery spins through its final waltz, Marshall contemplates the pulp of his thumbflesh.   He
    says the whorls remind him of a cartographical system still undiscovered.  It's obvious that Aveo, with
    its tardy amalgam of Cure-rock, has him rethinking Barsuk.  It's not enough to forgive them for Gibbard's
    gum-toothed melancholy, but it may prove a serviceable distraction.  Anything to quell his monomania."
2518	19978	"Give Dave Huismans credit for this: his albums may fall short of brilliance, but with each one he at least finds a new way to do so. In the last five years, his work under his 2562 moniker mutated from restrained, minimalist dubstep (2009's Unbalance) to disco-informed twitch-bass (2011's Fever) to ambient techno infused with Middle Eastern atmosphere and field recordings (2012's Air Jordan EP)—concepts that promised more than they delivered while still finding at least some prime real estate on dancefloor playlists. You could move to it, but good luck finding a real emotional connection inside those rhythmic lines.This time, 2562's method involves drawing in a glut of no wave, new age, coldwave, and whatever synthesized washes of overcast dystopian malaise he can bolt to a solid 4/4. That's given The New Today more of a human feeling than previous works—even if said human feeling is shot through with a tense dread. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that it's one of those clinical exercises more focused on refining sounds than making them resonate as something actually alive. Listen to those six-minute builds crawl to a crest, key in to the vague bristle of an abstracted foreboding, but don't expect any moments of revelation. It's ambient techno at room temperature.It can be appealing in a purely scientific sense to go through and catalog each track's tactile qualities. Maybe it's because it follows a space-station hum of a cliché-riddled ambient opener (""Arrival""), but ""Terraforming"" quickly jumps out as a high point, nearly 10 minutes of giant-machine startup-process churn. Unexpected yet subtle intrusions of new age synth throw off the mood in an intriguing way, and elsewhere on the record contrasting elements jump out—light pianos in the pistons-and-steam clutter of ""Cauldron"", or the waning moments of ""Vibedoctor"" where treated vibraphones start frantically spilling all over one another.And yet the music is still distant, no matter how up-close the beats feel. Once the songs become familiar, the pleasures disappear along with the surprises. It's frustrating that Huisman is so skilled at crafing individual sounds but unable to put them all together. Someday, there might be a 2562 full-length with all this record's elusive textures, the unpredictability of Fever's mutant-disco rhythms, and the deep warmth of Unbalance. In the meantime, it's another case of try again, fail again, fail better."
12669	3679	"As always, the shifting features of the underground continue to assemble and mutate according to their own peculiar gravity. One of the most unexpected and impressive recent formations is GHQ, a trance-folk group made up of Marcia Bassett (Double Leopards, Hototogitsu), Pete Nolan (Magik Markers, Wooden Wand & the Vanishing Voice), and Steve Gunn (provenance unknown). Cosmology of Eye is their first official album following a typically murky history of small-batch recordings, and here the trio vividly broadcasts an astonishing selection of American primitive drone, slow-puffing acoustic strums, and elongated, dimly-lit ragas.

    The most immediately striking aspect about Cosmology of Eye is how dissimilar it is to Bassett and Nolan's better-known projects. Listeners familiar with either Magik Markers' spazz-rock extremism or the skull-warping mysteries of Double Leopards might initially be taken aback by the graceful, unhurried majesty of GHQ's drowsy astral maneuvers. As such, this album provides a valuable counterbalance to each musician's previous body of work, infusing their steadfast, ecstatic drone-rituals with a welcome crosscurrent of fresh oxygen. At times the patient, widescreen visions of Cosmology of Eye can seem like a deliberate reverse-image of Double Leopards' claustrophobic din, as GHQ's quiet orbits trace some of the same mystical arcs as East Coast avant-pioneers like Angus Maclise or Henry Flynt.

    The echoes of these visionary forebears are most evident on the opening ""Drink the Good Moon"", which layers minimalist violin scrapings over distant percussion and shadowy vocal incantations. Though Bassett's vocals are featured more prominently on the bottomless swirl of ""Drift-Void"", lucid conversation is kept to a minimum around these campfires, as everyone instead seems intent on staring at the flames, hoping to discern whatever spirit figures might rise from the ashes. The epic, loose-formed raga ""Lie, Live, Make It"" forms the bulk of the album's second side, and its repetitive, unresolvable patterns manage to simultaneously recall the celestial mantras of Popul Vuh and the primal rhythms of the Godz. Better yet is the album-closing ""Black River Apples"", which features spiraling, Sandy Bull-like strands of guitar and banjo and likely stands as the most unabashedly gorgeous music either Bassett or Nolan have ever had a hand in.

    Predictably, GHQ have already followed Cosmology of Eye with the full-length La Poesia Visiva CD-R on the Heavy Blossom label. On this release the trio return to the fertile climes of Cosmology of Eye, dipping again into the perpetual drone-streams that seem always to reside just out of view, extending to the horizon in every direction. If Hototogitsu, Double Leopards, and Magik Markers are sometimes able to channel the exact vibrations of an ongoing apocalypse, GHQ instead create the enlightened hymns of post-urban survivors. Time will only tell if they will eventually become as endlessly prolific as Bassett and Nolan's other groups, but for now it would appear that GHQ have momentum on their side."
11280	10350	"
    Bottom of the Hudson was once primarily a one-man band, releasing two patchwork demo-sounding albums before
    pulling together the effortlessly great and unfortunately overlooked Holiday
    Machine EP in 2005. That record was steeped in both the proud melodies and personal
    intimacy of 1990s indie, treading that balance easily thanks to the
    clean lo-fi aesthetic of bedroom auteur Eli Simon. In reviewing that EP for
    Pitchfork, I belabored a comparison between BOTH and Guided by Voices, which
    wasn't completely fair; it's not like they're the only two bands with equal
    affinity towards lo-fi recording and the British Invasion. They're
    both rare in how well they can balance the two, however, and Fantastic
    Hawk shows that and more. It's an album of simple, irresistible melodies
    and slow, subtle crescendos and insinuations that earn the band's occasional
    grand gestures.
    While Fantastic
    Hawk makes use of a real studio, Simon's best songs transcend however
    they may be recorded. ""Pretty Much It"" exemplifies his ability for laconic
    vocal melodies that tug on the ears and pull us in like a familiar scent.
    ""Perfect Distillation"" (a phrase you'll likely only read in record
    reviews) builds slowly and cautiously to its perky, note-perfect chorus, while the
    ascending guitars on the sneaky coda of ""Suffering Time"" are cannily
    constructed and immaculately delivered. So there's tracks that would sound
    great in any setting, and tracks that meet new sounds halfway, like the
    woodwinds that pop up in the final moments of ""Fantastic Hawk"" or the
    Elvrum-like acoustic scrape of ""Rusty Zippers"", which puts all the burden
    on Simon's arresting vocal regardless of the oboes and zithers that garnish it.
    There are also songs that, given the new studio treatment, should hit harder than
    they do: The raining marimbas and insistent guitar chug of ""Bee Hive""
    cry out for top-down highway drives, but its strangely demure rhythm section keeps
    it stuck somewhere between intimacy and grandeur. ""Over Engineered""
    is an overcooked lighter lifter with sheets of underwhelming shoegaze-stolen static. ""Cemetary Gates"" in particular punches
    at the walls of the band's limitations. From the staccato fake-out drums to the
    skittering drum pads, experimental and scattered under Simon's gift for
    traditional songwriting, its potential shines through while still begging for a
    more sympathetic producer.

    Of course, as with the case
    with many of our favorite lo-fi bands (including the aforementioned GBV), we
    tend to love them during their formative years and turn on them when they get
    access to real studios and recording budgets. Fickle, maybe, and not something
    to accurately level at BOTH, but maybe we love not only these bands' tunes but
    their potential, embracing their would-be classics in their roughened state
    while believing they'd conquer the world if given a chance. Bottom of the Hudson deserve more than
    their small, fervent following, but while Fantastic Hawk has
    plenty of new sounds and strong moments, it seems to lack that world-conquering
    ambition.

17956	5981	"I've always been suspicious of Elephant 6 musicians. First of all, they call themselves
    part of a ""collective."" When I think of a ""collective,"" my geeky mind immediately turns
    to the Borg. And while, as far as I know, the Elephant 6'ers aren't planning any kind of
    sinister interplanetary takeover, the comparison is quite appropriate. Elephant 6 artists,
    especially the Olivia Tremor Control, have managed to assimilate the better aspects of
    several genres-- from '60s pop and rock to electronica and R&B--; into an easy-to-stomach
    pop-tinted form.
    Still, ""collective"" may not be quite the right word.  It's just too technical and non-
    descript. I looked it up, and Merriam-Webster defines a collective as ""a cooperative unit
    or organization."" Big deal. A bunch of my friends and I could sell lemonade on the street
    corner and call ourselves ""The Citrus 3 Collective."" That's no fun. No, the Elephant 6
    Collective should be called ""The Cult of the Six Elephants."" That's right, cult.
    So what makes the Elephant 6 collective a cult? Mystery and intrigue. Almost every aspect
    of the Elephant 6 is a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a jewel case. Neutral Milk
    Hotel frontman Jeff Magnum has now supposedly joined the circus. A band called Frosted
    Ambassador, which I understand to be Olivia Tremor Control drummer Eric Harris' band,
    released an album which was supposedly discovered in a potter's shoebox. (Yeah, I know!)
    But as for the Olivia Tremor Control themselves, they've been relatively free of scandal.
    Frontmen Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss have never shrouded themselves in any kind of
    mystery. Until now.
    For months now, rumors of an Olivia Tremor Control breakup have spread like wildfire. The
    band has stopped touring, Bill Doss is now working on his Sunshine Fix Project, and Elephant
    6 message boards are buzzing with ""direct from the band"" breakup statements. And as if all
    this weren't a compelling enough argument that Olivia is about to bite the dust, the band
    has now presented their fans with Singles and Beyond-- a compilation of hard-to-find
    EPs, singles, and compilation appearances-- to remind us just how much Will and Bill will
    be missed.
    For relatively new Olivia-obsessives, Singles and Beyond is great. Highly sought-after
    early EPs such as The Giant Day, and the band's first release, California Demise,
    which dates back to when Jeff Magnum was still a member of the OTC, are compiled onto a single
    $12 CD. Also included are countless singles and compilation appearances, many of which have
    been all but unavailable until now.
    ""Love Athena"" and ""Today I Lost a Tooth,"" both from the California Demise EP, kick off
    Singles and Beyond with some of the best pop tunes ever written by the Olivias. Fuzzy
    guitars play indelible hooks while Hart and Doss sing abstract lyrics in heavenly harmonies.
    California Demise proves to be a record in the same vein as the group's first full-length,
    Dusk at Cubist Castle-- excellent lo-fi pop songs with a few well-placed bits of
    electronics and found noise. Additional highlights come with ""Beneath the Climb,"" from a long
    out-of-print Cassiel Records compilation, and ""I'm Not Feeling Human,"" from the Giant Day
    EP.
    Unfortunately, the odds-and-sods nature of Singles and Beyond prevents it from packing
    the same punch as the band's two full-length albums, Dusk at Cubist Castle and Black
    Foliage. Both of those records, particularly Black Foliage, were well-hinged epics,
    centering on indecipherable though clearly present themes. With each track, these records drew
    you in with a perfectly balanced blend of pop melodies and noisy arrangements. Adding to the
    overwhelming depth was the multi-faceted collage nature of the recordings. Bizarre sounds were
    referenced multiple times throughout the records, making familiar friends of these decidedly
    alien noises. Now, for the first time on an Olivia Tremor Control album, we're presented with
    a collection of songs instead of a full album, and the result is suitably less compelling.
    While Singles and Beyond may just be a collection of songs, it is nonetheless a collection
    of Olivia Tremor Control songs, and a must-have for any fan. For the first time in ages, fans can
    command a relatively complete collection of the band's singles and EPs without taking out a second
    mortgage. As for me, I'm stashing away the $12 I was planning to spend on the Giant Day EP
    in the desperate hope that someday soon there will be a brand spankin' new Olivia Tremor Control
    record for me to purchase. Unfortunately, my psychic inclination senses that this may be the
    band's final release."
5246	16952	"Values in hip-hop are shifting. Gone are the days when credibility was tethered to sheer lyricism, steady touring, self-promoted mixtapes, hard-won co-signs, major-label affiliations, or background. Masculinity and heterosexuality are no longer a given. Instead, in 2012 we have artists buoyed by novelty and crumbling barriers, hilarity potential, and glittery snowballs of online hype. If you could somehow cash in the head-spinning thrill of refreshing your Tumblr feed to find Danny Brown in Mark McNairy gear alongside Floridian princess Kitty Pryde, you could probably make a down payment on Kanye's newly-for-sale mansion. At this point it's still difficult to determine whether the new school is seriously overvalued or if we've just unnecessarily moored ourselves to outmoded guidelines for too long.Sasha Go Hard is a rising Chicago rapper who straddles both the old and current systems. As a baby-faced teenage girl, she wears the coveted contemporary badge of internet-savvy hip-hop outsider, frequently posting videos of her (often all-female) cohort rolling around in hypeball extraordinaire Chief Keef's Southside Chicago neighborhood haunts, sitting pretty in oversized SUVs, and practicing dance moves. But on the other hand, Sasha is a traditionally solid rapper, and Do You Know Who I Am? is, above all, a traditionally promising mixtape from someone making steady, earned progress. It's a marked leap from an earlier tape called Glory Girl, and it's exciting to feel a rapper grow palpably better, brandishing tough-talking tunnel-vision confidence. A lot here is owed to excellent production from beat makers as hungry for recognition as Sasha is. The fleshed-out beat selection from producers like Absolut P, Young Chop, and Block On Da Track here is sometimes monstrous-- the tape often feels like it's a machine lurching forward as metallic slugs slip and slurp through its many gears and tin pellets ricochet throughout its casing. The best beats-- like Absolut P's on the murderous ""A&E""-- seem to rile Sasha up in the best way, acting as menacing vehicles for the compulsively simple, hypnotically repetitive hooks she's got a knack for. ""My lil' bad ass/ My li'/ My li' bad ass,"" goes one. ""Money/ Money/ Money/ Money/ I want more money,"" goes another. ""If you mad 'cuz I'm bad/ Then I'm glad/ 'Cuz you sad."" They pile up in long chain links, making it especially exciting when Sasha chooses to switch up her tone or employ a bit of wordplay, like on ""More Money"": ""On the beat go dumb/ And dumb/ And dumb/ Feel it froggie, jump."" On a song like posse cut ""I'm Hotta"", which features Chella H and her most immediate contemporary, Katie Got Bandz, she seems to stumble into her range by repeating the word ""bars"" in a startling way: ""Bars. Barsbars. bars. Bawwwwrs."" On the other hand, she shows her weakness on a couple of tone-deaf slow songs, ""You the One"" and ""Tell Me"". She raps far better than she'll ever sing-- nothing wrong with that. One of the best things about Do You Know Who I Am? is that it sounds sustainable, consistent from front to back in a way that could easily yield two or three more equally assertive tapes this year. Barring unforeseen interference (namely: a premature major-label deal), Do You Know Who I Am? could preclude a run reminiscent of 2008- and 2009-era Gucci Mane, 2011-era Waka Flocka Flame, or pre-Pluto Future. It could be reminiscent of Nicki Minaj's Beam Me Up Scotty, and not simply because there's a song that's (very possibly coincidentally) titled ""Itty Bitty"" on here. For a rapper so perfectly suited to 2012 sensibilities, a return to tradition is oddly exhilarating. If anything, Sasha suggests a hopeful possibility that qualities like unfamiliarity and tradition, novelty and aptitude, hype and progress are not mutually exclusive-- in the future, the best artists will probably have all of it."
3243	19197	"The union of Man Forever and So Percussion is so natural, it could have been caused by gravity. Both acts seek new sounds and ideas via percussion, and both embrace devout repetition as a tool for finding unbeaten paths. Granted, they’ve arrived at that task from different angles: Man Forever is Oneida drummer Kid Millions alongside many partners from the underground rock world, while So Percussion is a quartet of former Yale grad students who perform works by heavyweights like Steve Reich and David Lang. But both share a vision of percussion as exploratory and expansive rather than supplementary.In fact, their visions are so expansive that combining them could be too much of a good thing. There’s already a lot to absorb in the respective work of Man Forever and So Percussion, so their big, active sounds might crowd each other, perhaps even cancel each other out. Neither happens on Ryonen, which spreads 30 minutes of music across two tracks. There’s clarity throughout, even when drums overlap and rhythms blur, as well as a precision that gives a sense of purpose to every move. The whole isn’t greater than the sum of its parts; that’d be too much to expect of two entities with such high-quality individual track records. But Ryonen is an engaging first strike.What makes it engaging is its continual forward motion. Both pieces are loop-based, their cores formed by cycles of percussion that repeat for long stretches. Yet both also make progress, rarely dragged down by the weight of their over-and-over beats. Part of this progress comes from sonic variety: multiple types of drums and cymbals are employed, and one piece requires that each instrument be played ""in a different time signature at the same tempo.” But progress also comes in the way participants use energy to create kinetic waves. They’re able to make the same figure sound different through the intensity and force of their playing.Those waves are most obvious on opener “The Clear Realization,” since the percussion recedes to let in a dreamy voice that sounds uncannily like HEALTH’s Jake Duzsik. Adding singing is an interesting move—I wouldn’t have guessed vocals would have anything to do with this collaboration—and the choice gives dramatic tint to a piece that’s otherwise about physicality. But it also makes “The Clear Realization” oddly light. It’s as if the musicians felt compelled to filter their ideas through something literal like speech, rather than letting the drumming do the talking. The song might be more broadly communicative as a result, but it’s also more generic.Vocals emerge on Ryonen’s closing title track too, but they come much later in the game, and they’re more about adding texture than taking the lead. The percussion in turn is also more complex and subtle. It begins like a collection of offset drumrolls, but gradually masses into a growling drone, then returns even more pointed and hypnotic than it began. As hummed voices rise with the final percussion climax, “Ryonen” scales heights despite few overt, attention-grabbing changes. In doing so, it gives the collection an ideal ending point: it's both the album's peak and a ramp Man Forever and So Percussion could use to shoot higher, if we’re lucky enough to get a second meeting of these skillful minds."
13018	3354	"Instead of explaining the Buddha Machine, I wish I could just persuade you to drop the cash and order one, so you can figure it out on your own. Giving you my impressions will ruin the fun, in the same way that you don't give kids a review of a toy-- you just hand it over and let them start playing. When mine came in the mail, opening the box gave me a kind of Christmas morning rush and a flash of ""what is this thing?"" It's packaged in a small cardboard box printed with Chinese lettering around an image of a street scene. Inside you'll find what looks like a small transistor radio, plus two AA batteries (also Chinese).

    Switch it on, and a soft, ambient loop starts to crackle through the tiny, cheap speaker built into the device. You can adjust the volume dial, or switch between the nine short loops programmed into the Buddha Machine-- and then you set it down and leave it alone. I've left it playing hours at a time while I sit at my desk, and I could even picture installing these around my house, like low budget installation art.

    But I don't want to get hung up on its artistry, because most important of all, it's also an object. The minute I opened the box, I wanted to hold it in my hand, and play with the switches, and carry it around with me. It has an output jack, but it's much more fun to listen to its cheap built-in speaker: at low volumes, the loops are placid, fitting into the corner of your ear, but turn up the dial or press it to your ear and you hear hundreds of nuances and crackles of static. And best of all, the music never stops. Sure, you can listen to a minimalist CD and imagine how it would feel to hear it for days on end, but the Buddha Machine lets you try it: There's no 80-minute limit, and the batteries will go for hours. Psychologically, it makes a big difference when you aren't waiting for the music to fade out.

    The nine loops are suggestive, but they're deliberately not engaging. A piece like Ekkehard Ehlers' ""Plays John Cassavetes 2"" makes you feel like you could hear it repeat forever, but in practice it needs to wrap itself up and end before we can get tired of it. The loops on the Buddha Machine don't shift or change over time, although you may be tricked into believing that they do, and a couple of loops that almost have hooks actually made me anxious, as I realized that I was waiting for them to move on. (The ninth loop, which is only two seconds long, is too fast and abrupt and probably could have been cut.)

    More than anything, the Buddha Machine is a great way to study ambient music. It's built to produce background music, but as you treat it more functionally, you might question whether it's ""art."" What's the point of music that doesn't move forward? Can something this boundless and utilitarian meet the same criteria as an album, like Brian Eno's Discreet Music, where the system was designed to run forever but strategically isn't allowed to? You don't have to think about these issues-- or about anything at all-- but you'd be missing out on part of the fun.

    Some people will call this a novelty, but it's not: It's a toy. Most of us are drawn to little gadgets that make music; we love to pick them up and fiddle with the switches, and play with them, and figure out how they work. Along the way we're testing and stretching the ways we experience and consume music. The Buddha Machine isn't the first self-contained music maker to sell as a work of electronic art, but it is an almost perfectly-realized example. And I can't stop playing with it."
8354	13732	"The eight-year career of Jawbox could be written as a cautionary tale: indie band signs to a big label, makes two great records that eventually fall out of print, and breaks up. But listening to Jawbox's freshly reissued 1994 major-label debut, For Your Own Special Sweetheart, it's difficult to conclude they made the wrong decision by recording this album for Atlantic. The obvious reason is cold, hard cash: Sweetheart might sound unassumingly direct, but it takes a lot of time and money to make a record this precise and balanced. The other reason is more nebulous, but no less relevant: You don't jump ship from a dogmatically anti-major label like Dischord to a behemoth like Atlantic without understanding that the next thing you do had better be really, really good. While a more naïve band might have diluted its sound to seek fame and fortune, Jawbox cashed in the chips on their shoulders and made their most uncompromising and ferocious record.Sweetheart's return to Dischord reintroduces the album as a win-win prospect: a record with a mid-90s alt-rock budget, but none of that era's corny or diminishing relics. Bob Weston's thoughtful remaster retains the dynamic range of the original while breathing new life into its low end; Zach Barocas' kick drum finally feels like a punch in the chest. The essential B-sides from the Savory EP are included as well. Even the cover art has been revised, the dated sepia toned blow-up doll image of the original replaced by a solidly cast marble figure rendered in high-contrast grayscale.The new cover is apt; FYOSS is downright sculptural in its attention to form and structure. The brilliance of FYOSS lies not in any one melody, guitar line, or drum fill but rather in the interaction between these elements. Every song is a thoughtfully interrelated system, an organic economy of sound, rhythm, and gesture. At times, once-distant guitar parts come together with such effortless strength that you can visualize guitarists J. Robbins and Bill Barbot bending the necks of their instruments in unison. Ted Nicely's impeccable production lends a subtle sheen to the album's pop sensibility but never dulls its harsh edges, revealing a band that is well-versed in both harmony and discord (no pun intended).At its best, FYOSS compresses the energy of hardcore into something more nuanced and deliberate. ""Savory"" is a masterfully constructed study in tension and release, as Robbins' simple vocal melody is made infinitely more potent by layers of dissonant guitar chords, sparse bass, and violent, propulsive drumming. Even the song's angelic chorus seems subtly unresolved and menacing, though Robbins' and Barbot's guitars chime rather than stab. The guitar ""solo"" consists of little more than occasional muted feedback bursts, instead serving to emphasize the monolithic force of the band's rhythm section in the absence of Robbins' vocals. The J.G. Ballard-inspired ""Motorist"" narrates a car crash as metallic guitars jut out from a spare, skeletal frame. ""Cruel Swing"" sounds exactly like you'd think, Barocas absolutely pummeling his kit over a walking bass figure that sounds like it's challenging you to a fight. Album closer ""Whitney Walks"" contorts the limitations of Robbins' vocal range into a uniquely seething, uneasy kind of melancholy that perfectly prefigures the song's explosive finale.The highlight of this reissue of Sweetheart, however, may very well be Savory B-side ""68"". For an odd-time-signature rock song, ""68"" is disarmingly elegant, to the point where you barely even notice that it's chugging along in 7/4. Here, you can understand why the Dismemberment Plan were quick to cite Jawbox as an influence: The improbable chord changes and impossible rhythmic ideas on FYOSS are rendered as seamless and intuitive as possible. Though the playing here is solid throughout, nothing about the record is flashy or unattainable-- restraint and discipline consistently best self-aware complexity.While FYOSS itself doesn't sound dated, the notion that plainly recorded guitar, bass, drums, and vocals can add up to something extraordinary sometimes does. The onslaught of radio-friendly ""alternative"" bands that followed Jawbox has left us understandably wary of well-produced, punk-informed rock music with no obvious quirks or departures. But FYOSS has aged well precisely because it did not pander to the aesthetic fads of its time-- mainstream or underground. Instead, Jawbox honed their sound, maximized the resources at their disposal, and made a record that hides behind no extraneous instruments, sounds, or ideologies."
15659	5170	"How much the second volume of guitarist Loren Connors' The Departing of a     Dream differs from the first depends a lot on how closely you want to     listen. On the surface, Vol. II is very much of a piece with its     predecessor, characterized by its by vast, quiet spaces, unhurried     compositions, and an overall sense of dread and despair. The instrumental     makeup is pretty much identical-- Connors is credited with guitars, tapes     and sounds-- and Volume II seems very much like a continuation.     But the details and proportions here have been shuffled, and if you get     down and listen closely enough, this a different kind of record.The first thing you'll notice is that Connors spends a bit more time here on     the ""tapes"" and ""sounds"" and a bit less on the guitar. Field recordings form     the essential character of many tracks. The third track (no titles) has only     a strum or two of guitar and mostly consists of what sounds like a recording     of an abandoned field along the side of a busy highway.  You can hear the wind     through the long grass and the hum of traffic a little ways away, and can     almost see the decade-old rusted cans and yellow newspaper scraps tangled in     the scrubby underbrush. It's quite an evocative piece considering it was     probably recorded on a random afternoon on a Walkman.The sixth track was recorded a bit further into the wilderness, across the     woods and into the forest, and this time, at dawn, complete with a cooing     mourning dove. The first track has a similarly rich ambient layer with a     more industrial bent, but quiet and in the distance. And over the noise     Connors layers his plucked, sustained, carefully laid notes.On the tracks without field recordings Departing of a Dream feels     familiar. A melody tumbles from Connors' hands with hints of processing and     wah-wah to make a tone that bubbles up from some waterlogged dream. Once     again, Connors is a master of slow instrumental heartbreak, and if you're     in the wrong mood, this record can actually be painful to listen to. The     seventh track, for example, is a slow pan across a bombed-out landscape of     emotional devastation, all gurgly tone, bent notes, and shapeless melody.The shorter eighth track, which closes this brief (31-minute) album, has a     warmer, sunnier cast, which somehow makes things even worse. The suggestion     of hope and renewal seems like a prelude to another shattering reality     somewhere in the blurry future. If you're sad and anxious you have a friend     in Loren Connors. "
15165	7740	"There's something about the kitchen-sink approach to music that makes me suspicious.  Excessive genre-hopping
    or wearing stylistic flexibility as a badge is often considered honorable or even proof of an artist's
    restless, boundless talent.  Yet when this approach is put under a microscope, the choice to aim for a
    variety of different sounds often seems like a mask for artists unable to do any one thing particularly
    well.
    A lot of the initial praise garnered by Scissor Sisters stemmed from their oscillation between what many
    consider to be disparate styles: To be reductive, those are rollicking early 70s Elton John-esque pop songs
    and buoyant disco.  However, on their self-titled debut, Scissor Sisters not only do quite a few genres
    justice-- not least of which is witty, irreverent pop songs-- but both their idiosyncratic approach to
    music and their sensibilities seem to have common roots in glam-era rock or Philly soul.
    On the face of it, that's an odd blend.  Unless you're Ryan Adams, Homer Simpson, or those bearded fellows
    in Kings of Leon, you aren't likely of the mindset that rock achieved perfection in 1974.  But the Sisters
    embrace the playfulness and panache of that era's artists-- from Sparks and Elton, to 10cc and Mott the
    Hoople, to The Spinners and, um, Pink Floyd-- and come out smelling like roses.  Here, the Sisters skip
    smartly through glam's linear history, and stray far enough from the beaten path to discover a sound of
    their own, all while resisting the sacrifice of context for pantomime.
    With one part arched eyebrows and droll wit, and one part melancholia and sharp social observation, the
    Sisters' debut is bursting with golden moments.  To the disappointment of some, large portions of the
    Scissor Sisters' highly circulated and heavily dancefloor-leaning demo has been either re-recorded or
    exorcised from the final cut, but the retail version outstrips the demo by a mile.  ""Doctor (I'm Only
    Seeing Dark)"", ""Backwoods"", and ""Bicycling with the Devil"" in particular are missed, but with their
    inclusion, the finished product would likely have been a far more schizophrenic affair.
    Instead, the Sisters' debut hangs together well, despite sounding at times more like a career-spanning
    singles compilation than a cohesive work. (Although, in this MP3 era, where's the harm in that?)  Debut
    single ""Laura"", with its overflow of rollicking piano and wah-wah guitar, is the hyper-jovial opener.
    Break-up song ""Better Luck"" and the falsetto-drenched disco cover of ""Comfortably Numb"" (what might have
    been had Pink Floyd followed their classic rock contemporaries into late 70s disco tourism) are the
    dancing-with-tears-in-your-eyes tracks.  ""Tits on the Radio"" is New York's best protest dance song since
    !!!, and ""Lovers in the Backseat"" is a gold lamé-draped take on voyeurism.  ""Mary"" and ""It Can't Come
    Quickly Enough"", meanwhile, are the 4 a.m. ballads, contenders for the night's penultimate spin before
    ""Last Dance"" soundtracks the queue at the coat check.
    Best of all are ""Take Your Mama"" and ""Return to Oz"".  The former is a clever Primal Scream-meets-""Freedom
    '90"" suggestion to come out to your mother during a night on the town.  The latter is a weary, hungover
    ballad lamenting the influence of crystal meth on the gay nightclub scene (""What once was Emerald City's/
    Now a crystal town"").  In combination, those two tracks delightfully reveal that under Scissor Sisters'
    sheen of fabulousness and irresistible hooks beats a heart that breaks as easily as it bursts, and that's
    a sort of versatility that can't be easily concocted."
977	21686	"Explosions in the Sky are the kind of band that you think about in terms of scale. There is the sheer size of their songs, but also of the group: They've sold out Radio City Music Hall and play larger concert halls (which is surprising for a rock band without a vocalist); they famously soundtracked ""Friday Night Lights,"" a number of motion pictures, and their songs shows up on dozens of television shows. But their sixth album, The Wilderness, the first non-soundtrack collection since 2011's Take Care, Take Care, Take Care, feels remarkably small. Shifting inward and turning their gaze toward minutiae, the group still manages to create something that resonates in as grand a way, just via different means, and it's their best since 2003's The Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place.Like Cold Dead Place, The Wilderness gives you a sense of a landscape, but instead of a march towards a vast horizon, it feels like burrowing in to escape the cold. Those signature crescendos and climaxes are present, but just as often you find yourself contemplating near-silent electronic details or wisps of sound. On first listen The Wilderness sounds almost like a whisper; as you do dig in, the details grow and resonate. It's like taking a pause on a hike and realizing just how many sounds there are in what seemed like silence. The Austin band has been around since 1999, and you get the sense that they're searching for new paths to achieve their original goals.For the most part, the songs feel segmented and self-contained, standalone compositions instead of pieces of an overall fabric. They return time again to distorted drums that sometimes feel like echoes in a cave, other times like a crumbling landslide, while the guitars are generally crystalline and precise, sometimes taking on the texture of strings. It resembles Inventions, guitarist Mark T. Smith's more electronic side project with Eluvium, blended with Explosions' usual dramatics. ""Disintegration Anxiety,"" which opens with chopped sounds, is the album's big anthem, and they take their time getting there; it's the fifth song out of nine. It's fitting that the title evokes the title  of the Cure's landmark 1989 record—there's a similar sense of longing and a beautiful darkness at work here, too. You find the same atmosphere on ""Losing the Light"" as well—the quietest, most subterranean song on the album, it almost resembles a classical work or something by Tim Hecker, and it feels like spelunking in the dark and coming upon cluster of diamonds that help light your way. The music is rarely ""driving"" in the usual sense of the group—it's meditative and okay with staying in one place. ""The Ecstatics,"" for instance, has clicking, slow-motion electronic drums and the same bright, clean guitar as a number of the tracks, and moves in an aqueous slow motion with cold electronics that sound like fizzing water. There are upbeat moments, like ""Tangle Formations,"" or ""Infinite Orbit,"" which at first feels amorphous and ambient before suddenly catching fire. When it does finally open up, the effect is stunning.Because the group has done so much soundtracking, it's difficult when listening to The Wilderness not to think of images that could go with these songs. Instead of making music for dramatic moments in football games, we're getting sunsets you'll remember a decade later, stumbling first kisses, half-heard car alarms during a comforting dream, that horribly unreal and frozen moment when you first hear a friend has died, walks alone at dusk, laying on your back and watching the constellations with the person you want to grow old with, the calm of seeing a loved one sleep. These songs feel personal. They tug at important moments. It's a quietly masterful, emotionally rich work. Of all their records, it's ultimately the one that sounds the most like the image their band name evokes. But you're watching from a distance, and paying more attention to the person next to you than those colors smearing against the clouds overhead."
14570	8696	"If you're new to the Gary Wilson experience, here's a brief history: Back in 1977, the talented but eccentric
    Wilson went down into his parents' New Jersey basement and recorded what would become one of the most legendary
    self-released ""real people"" albums ever made: You Think You Really Know Me.  The record sounded as
    though it was aiming for some kind of Steely Dan/Shuggie Otis electro-funk fusion, but the uncomfortable
    intimacy and passion of Wilson's performance instead rendered the album a bizarre personal portrait of one
    man's lust, loneliness and inner turmoil.

    Despite the limited original pressing of You Think You Really Know Me, the album managed to take on
    a life of its own via word-of-mouth and non-commercial radio.  Many listeners who were originally attracted
    by the substantial comedy value of songs like ""6.4 = Make Out"" and ""Chromium Bitch"", and were further drawn
    in by Wilson's crazed white-man soul and not inconsiderable musical talent.  Over the next two decades, the
    album was issued several times by various labels, its small but fervent following-- which included fans
    like Beck (who name-checked Wilson on ""Where It's At""), Matt Groening, and The Roots' ?uestlove-- growing
    with each release.  But nobody was really sure what had ever become of Gary Wilson himself.

    Curiosity about Wilson hit a sort of critical mass following the latest reissue of You Think You Really
    Know Me on Motel records in 2002.  Though Motel released a collection of stray Wilson recordings as
    Forgotten Lovers in 2003, nobody realistically expected to hear anything more from him until Stones
    Throw Records' Peanut Butter Wolf finally tracked the man down in California.  At the time, Wilson was
    reportedly working at an adult video store and regularly gigging with a jazz lounge act, and was unsurprisingly
    delighted to learn about the acclaim his old work was receiving.  It didn't take much cajoling to convince
    Wilson to finally deliver a true follow-up.

    So here we are with Mary Had Brown Hair, which sounds more like 27 days have passed since You
    Think You Really Know Me than 27 years.  There are more drum machines this time around, as well as
    chirping Doogie Howser, M.D. synths and treated vocals reminiscent of early Ween.  These ""modern"" touches,
    however, cause the album to lose a bit of the swank, mustachioed 70s vibe of its predecessor.  There's also
    an increased emphasis on conventional pop songwriting; although that's speaking relatively-- these songs
    resemble actual pop radio hits the way basset hounds resemble lake trout.  Otherwise, Mary Had Brown
    Hair surely delivers everything that Wilson enthusiasts could have hoped for, perhaps even too much so.

    Erotic obsession and small-town alienation remain the central themes of Wilson's work, and as on his debut
    he here performs songs like ""Gary Saw Linda Last Night"", ""Our Last Date"", and ""Debbie, Debbie"" with an
    unnerving introspective intensity.  (I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that somewhere along the way
    Gary's caused some women to change their phone numbers.)  Fixated, adolescent love songs like ""Linda Wants
    to Be Alone"" (""She was writing a note to my parents saying that I was bothering her"") that were borderline
    creepy in 1977 are downright alarming now that the guy is legitimately in his 50s.  Scariest of all is ""Gary's
    in the Park"", which features a menacing Wilson intoning the lines, ""Gary's in the dark/ And you know I'll
    be waiting for you...""

    The possibility exists, of course, that this whole troubled ""Gary Wilson"" persona is just a fictional
    construction of an artist that's simply giving his audience what they want to hear, a theory given
    credibility by the fact that, throughout the album, the singer refers to Gary Wilson in the third person
    as though it's just a role he's playing.  This illustrates what has always been the big conundrum regarding
    outsider music: If the artist is as lacking in self-awareness as he seems to be, it risks putting the
    audience in a condescending, ""let's all laugh at the freak"" position.  Or is Gary Wilson's whole weirdo-loner
    shtick an elaborate affectation meant to dress up what is otherwise nice but pretty mundane synth-pop?  Can
    he really have changed this little over the last 27 years?

    Whatever the truth is regarding Wilson's methods and intentions, there's no doubt that Mary Had Brown
    Hair is one of the oddest and most baffling musical artifacts you're likely to get your mitts on in
    2004-- one that raises more questions than it answers.  How much you'll actually want to listen to it over
    the next 27 years is a question you'll have to answer for yourself."
8654	12781	"""I think there's a hell of a good buck to be made out of solving our problems. So we'll probably solve them for better or worse.""--Doug Randle, quoted in the original liner notes to   Songs for the New Industrial State.There's a funny mix of cynicism and optimism in that quotation from Canadian songwriter Doug Randle that nicely sums up the prevailing sentiment of his lone album. Originally recorded only for broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1970, the record was ostensibly given a new lease on life when the Kanata label picked it up the following year for release, but poor distribution ensured its quick trip into the recesses of Canadian music history, where it remained until now.On its surface,   Songs for the New Industrial State  is a sunny pop record adorned with many of the baroque trappings of adult-aimed light music records and California pop-psych, but there's much at work within that glossy interior. Randle turns his background composing music for advertisements inside-out with lyrics that carefully dissect the very methods he employed to sell things and lay their phoniness bare. In the late 60s and early 70s, lyrics decrying the artifice of a plastic world and environmental degradation weren't uncommon, but Randle does it differently, sometimes with a charming awkwardness that leaves the notion of rhyme scheme behind. He'd written musicals for the CBC, and that background is evident here, too-- the album as a whole feels something like an inversion of the industrial musicals that large companies frequently staged at shareholder meetings and sales events from the 40s into the 80s.Randle doesn't sing or play anything on the album, instead serving as the composer/conductor while steady studio hands take care of the instrumental parts. The dual vocals of Tommy Ambrose and Laurie Bower, which alternate between harmony and unison singing, give the record a distinctive, plush feel. They help to sell Randle's vision of commerce trampling nature and peace of mind amid the fanfare of trumpets and strings as surely as the lady who sang ""My Bathroom Is a Private Kind of Place"" sold American Standard fixtures. Randle's open-hearted sincerity and tendency to say exactly what he's thinking without irony means that a lot of modern listeners will have to make a bit of an adjustment for lines like ""Warm wood/ It looks like warm wood/ Touch it/ It feels like colored plastic.""""Nicolston Dam"" has some of the album's best imagery as Randle contrasts the pace of modern life with just sitting and watching trout leap over a dam, which nicely ties in the environmental themes that are also on his mind. On the odd, harpsichord-stuffed ""One-Way Swimming"" he offers to a hypothetical partner a way to get even further from the modern world: swimming out into the middle of the ocean. It doesn't quite advocate suicide, but it does suggest that falling off the edge of the world might be a nice escape. At the other end of the record, ""Vive La Company"" is a satirical portrait of a company man and his wife who tailor their interests and conversation to help him up the corporate ladder while their children walk to school singing commercials.Randle's battle between cynicism about modern life and wide-eyed optimism is ultimately won by the latter, as he ends the album with ""Life Will Be Worth Living"". Naturally, many concerns on the record still ring true today, even if our ways of talking and singing about them have evolved as our society has moved from industrial to post-industrial. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but the album is a work of singular vision that earns its second airing through Randle's inventive sense of arrangement and to-the-point honesty."
7850	14221	"Cory Rayborn is a lawyer in High Point, N.C., who, for the last decade, has run Three Lobed Recordings, a tiny, taste-driven label that specializes in the most electric, radiant drones and acoustic, ruminative rambles. Three Lobed's distinguished roster of alumni includes Tom Carter, Wooden Wand, Heavy Winged, Sunburned Hand of the Man, Six Organs of Admittance, Bardo Pond, and a horde of like minds-- basically, a fantasy camp for the wilder, woollier facets of what's been, for better and worse, dubbed New Weird America.Since 2008, Three Lobed also released two LPs by Jack Rose, the acoustic guitarist generally accepted as his form's giant. In the 1990s with the band Pelt, Rose made the sort of eternal atmospheres that suggested La Monte Young relocating to the foot of Appalachia. At the turn of the decade, Rose turned his fingers to a series of progressively ambitious solo guitar albums. The early work owed obvious debts to John Fahey, but Rose's parallel explorations of Middle Eastern music and the blues, bluegrass, and string band music pushed him to new shapes and sounds. When he died on December 5, 2009, he was on a serious hot streak. A full-length collaboration with Virginia string band the Black Twig Pickers and its then-forthcoming follow-up-- his ecstatic Thrill Jockey Records debut, Luck in the Valley, recorded with many of the same musicians-- stand as two of his career's best. With a technique and tone that seemed slowly carved from the trunk of an age-old oak, Rose was the well-listened, workmanlike advocate for the future of American primitive music. Down with indie kids, skilled enough to stun anyone, Rose seemed poised at last to have an impact beyond his own sphere of influence.Turns out, he already had: Not long after Rose died, Rayborn sent a late-night mass e-mail to most of the musicians he'd met as a listener or label head, asking if they'd like to offer a tune for his tribute to Rose. There were no length limits and no style guidelines-- only no covers of Rose tunes because, as Rayborn puts it, ""Jack would not dig that."" By the next morning, he'd secured a contribution commitment from a musician who hadn't even received the original invitation. And so, Honest Strings: A Tribute to the Life and Work of Jack Rose snowballed into a glorious and gargantuan 41-track, seven-hour, online-only ode.The importance of Rayborn's decision to make the tribute available only through download cannot be understated. Here, it allows for a rare marriage of quantity and quality, since each piece feels as uninhibited as the whole. Among the contributors are the expected-- Byron Coley, the Black Twig Pickers, D. Charles Speer, Steve Gunn, Loren Connors, No Neck Blues Band, and Hush Arbors, just to sample. But the true testament to Rose's legacy and conviviality are those you might not expect-- rock'n'roll bluesman Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi All-Stars, Mogwai's Stuart Leslie Braithwaite, and 90s improvisational outfit Un. As such, it pays its respects without suffering an overload of reverence. Sure, there are acoustic guitar songs, but they come embedded among brilliant beds of rock'n'roll, country, improvisation, drone, spoken-word, book readings, and complete live explorations. It's less a eulogy for Rose and more a celebration of his-- or, really, anyone's-- obsession with music.Any concerns about 41 tracks of guitarists swiping Rose's style are void from the start: In just the first five cuts, Chris Forsyth offers a repetitive roadhouse number, while recent Rose collaborator D. Charles Speer twists jokes and memories of Jack around a goofy country trot that recalls Roger Miller's ""King of the Road"". Banjoist Charlie Parr and fiddler Mike Gangloff squeak and squeal through the exultant gospel exit ""This World Is Not My Home"". Six Organs of Admittance and Cian Nugent do reach for acoustics, but Six Organs' ""Drinking with Jack"" is a lithe, tender beauty; Nugent, a young Irishman, bends and breaks his themes. And that's just the first 27 minutes of this nearly 400-minute collection, not necessarily the best.Of these 41 pieces, there are very few blunders. Even the shortest one-- a patient 90-second reflection for acoustic guitar by Jenks Miller, better known for his drone and metal work as Horseback-- feels weighty. It's simple and sweet and, like the best work of the man to whom it's dedicated, is more concerned with expressing a feeling than evidencing high technique. Aside from a 54-minute reading from Joseph Mattson's debut novel, Empty the Sun, the longest track is a 43-minute live set from a Rose-less Pelt. Titled ""Louisville Susurration"", the piece unfolds with patience and grandeur. It alone would be a worthy album.Honest Strings is, at once, an incredibly demanding and non-threatening set. Its variety is either a marathon or a playground, meant as much for listening from one end to the other as it is for bouncing to and fro, picking up new sounds by artists you might not know. The entire set costs $15, too, or less than four cents per minute of music. Thanks to Rayborn's free curation and the free Web hosting of Thrill Jockey Records' digital outpost, Fina, every penny goes to Rose's estate. Much like the parameters Rayborn set for the collection, then, this brilliant mass of music is open to everyone. Now there's a legacy Jack would likely dig."
4843	17458	"Earlier this year, the Memphis quintet Sex Cult played SXSW and impressed the hell out of DIY punk busybody Ty Segall, who agreed to produce their debut album. In between that show and this release eight months later, the band traveled to San Francisco and cut tracks at Eric Bauer's studio in Chinatown, where Sic Alps, Thee Oh Sees, and pretty much every other San Francisco band have recorded. They also changed their name: Faced with a cease-and-desist letter from a New York label, Sex Cult converted to Ex-Cult.That westward progression suits the band well, especially since Fog City and Bluff City have so much in common. Both claim small but active scenes that gnaw the bones of their musical pasts: Segall and his contemporaries find inspiration in the seismic rumbles of hippie punks like the Beau Brummels and the Chocolate Watchband, while several generations of Memphis acts-- as diverse as Tav Falco, Reigning Sound, and even Jay Reatard-- have deconstructed and reassembled the r&b swagger that echoed off the walls of Sun, Stax, and every other local indie label.Those various strains are apparent on Ex-Cult's self-titled debut, which-- no surprise-- sounds like a Memphis punk band recording in San Francisco. It's never quite that simple, however: There are nods to nervy UK bands like Magazine and Wire, as well as to rambunctious Aussie punks like the Victims and Calif. crew the Angry Somaons (Ex-Cult covered ""No Fun on the Beaches"", by Mornington Peninsula's the Chosen Few, for the b-side of their recent ""M.P.D."" single). The Memphians' sound is streamlined but not hostile, powerful but not brutal, with ear-catching flourishes peppered throughout the dozen songs: the guitar chimes that open the album, the skronky guitairs on ""M.P.D."" that sound like saxophones, the circus-geek backing vocals on ""Don't Feel Anything"", the co-ed shouts on closer ""Future Victims"".There is plenty of Mid-South grit on ""Shade of Red"" and ""Young Trash"" to complement Ex-Cult's occasional bursts of West Coast melodicism, which may ultimately have less to do with Segall's production and more to do with the fact that Ex-Cult claims several members in common with Memphis indie-popsters Magic Kids. For all its urgency, Ex-Cult rarely slows down enough to let those component sounds combine and sink in. It's almost too intense for its own good, with one jittery punk attack after another. But the twin guitars, courtesy of J.B. Horrell and Alec McIntyre, always find some new texture to explore or some new perpetual-motion machine riff to lock in on, and Chris Shaw, formerly of Memphis hardcore act Vile Nation, shows a volatile charisma that occasionally sounds constrained in this studio setting. Ultimately, Ex-Cult gives the impression of a band more comfortable on stage than off; they have a great sense of punk's past, but they're still getting a grip on their present."
287	22437	The Pixies weren’t the only band that blazed the trail for alternative rock’s mainstream takeover in the ’90s, but they were the rare band that got to be trailblazers twice. When they regrouped at Coachella in 2004 after an 11-year breakup, they effectively ushered in another musical phenomenon: the indie-icon reunion-tour circuit. It granted the Massachusetts misfits a long overdue opportunity to play for the sort of massive crowds that their famous fans—Nirvana, Radiohead, and Weezer among them—had built on their influence. But what was once a valorous underdog-victory narrative has slowly turned into a cautionary tale about pissing away all the goodwill you’ve accrued.For the rest of the 2000s, the Pixies toured and toured as if they were on a mission to perform for every last person on Earth who longed to hear “Debaser” in the flesh. By the time they finally decided to release new music again in 2013, not only was bassist Kim Deal gone, so too was any lingering excitement about the prospect of new Pixies music. What’s more, the three scatterbrained EPs they issued between 2013 and 2014—later compiled and reshuffled in album form as Indie Cindy—only served to answer those deflated expectations with a collection of songs that overcompensated for their lack of vigor and volatility by amping up the egregious eccentricity.And yet despite that misfire, not to mention an aborted attempt to replace Deal with another Kim, the Pixies are giving it another go. With bassist Paz Lenchantin (A Perfect Circle, the Entrance Band) now officially sworn in, Head Carrier feels like an attempt to stabilize their course. The Pixies are no longer the legends resurfacing with their first album in 20 years; they’re just a steady-as-she-goes rock band cranking out another record. With Head Carrier, they’re essentially in their Voodoo Lounge phase, turning in the sort of middling, late-career album that will clog up the Pixies bin at your local record store when you’re looking to upgrade your worn-out copy of Surfer Rosa.If Head Carrier has no ambitions to be a return to a form, it at least doesn’t incite the same sort of facepalm incredulity as Indie Cindy. (Seriously: what the fuck was “Bagboy”?) On tuneful songs like “Classic Masher” and “Might As Well Be Gone,” you can hear traces of the band that made “Here Comes Your Man” and “Velouria.” But there’s scant evidence of the band that made “Vamos” or “Gouge Away”—the volcanic outbursts that made their more melodic songs shine like diamonds in the coal.The tension points that once made the Pixies so singular and striking—tiki-torched calm vs. eyeball-slicing chaos, sweetness vs. psychosis, American mythology vs. Spanish surrealism—have been thoroughly massaged out by this point. Yes, Kim Deal is missed, but so are Black Francis’ frightening mood swings, Joey Santiago’s blazing grease-rag guitars, and Dave Lovering’s concrete-cracking stomps. These Pixies are happy to just twang and jangle instead of slash and burn; on those rare occasions when they do try to rip up the asphalt (“Baal’s Back,” “Um Chagga Laga”), they sound less like ticking time-bomb terrors drunk on Dali and David Lynch than a mildly cranky Tex-Mex bar band.As futile as it may be to hold the current Pixies up to the standard of records they made nearly 30 years ago, the comparisons are unavoidable given that they’re still executing the same playbook, only with less enthusiasm. Lenchantin is called on to do everything Kim Deal used to do, but while her plainspoken delivery is genial enough, it doesn’t exude the mischievous glee that made her predecessor such an effective balm to Francis’ tonsil-shredding howls. And given that Francis doesn’t get all that worked up about much here, the contrast between the two is muted—she’s more harmonic support than a full-on foil.As such, Lenchantin’s lead vocal debut as a Pixie, “All I Think About Now,” is less notable for her performance than the lyrics Francis gave her to sing. Opening with an unsubtle echo of “Where Is My Mind?,” the song serves as Francis’ thank-you note to Deal, a fond remembrance of their working relationship to dispel the long-rumored animosity between the two. That sort of candor and poignancy are rare qualities in the Pixies canon—and credit Lenchantin, who came up with the lyrical concept, for nudging Francis into this uncharted terrain. But the singing-telegram approach feels sort of like, well, quitting your band by fax.The truth is, if Head Carrier had arrived as the umpteenth Frank Black solo album, little about it would seem amiss. But coming from a band whose legacy was built on shock-and-awe transgression, Head Carrier feels overly pleasant and pedestrian. I’m reminded of that infamous Steve Albini interview from the early ’90s where the Surfer Rosa producer called his former clients “a band who, at their top-dollar best, are blandly entertaining college rock.” At the time, the quote seemed like blasphemy. Now, it feels like prophecy.
16693	1538	"Though my hopes were briefly raised by a frazzled Christopher Lloyd in 1985, it's painfully obvious now
    that time travel doesn't exist as a human technological capability.  This being overwhelmingly the case, I
    will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly
    more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on
    mustachioed megalomaniacs.  So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put X-Files
    on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000.

    It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the
    new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being.  Then,
    toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism
    that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World.  This music was deemed fascinating,
    uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was
    to be the coming of ""the next Radiohead,"" or perhaps more tellingly, ""the next Travis.""

    This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who
    called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, ""Yellow"",
    as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots.
    I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled
    from, Parachutes.  It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening
    three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny.

    Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, A Rush of Blood to the Head has Coldplay taking
    a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well.
    I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would
    have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success.  But while the sound of
    this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys
    forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs.

    Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly ""Daylight"", with its swooping guitar
    and synth lines.  Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a
    song that otherwise wouldn't hold much.  Midtempo non-rockers ""Green Eyes"" and ""Warning Sign"" stretch the
    most obvious thread back to Parachutes with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed
    melodies.  And there are also a couple of ""memo to listener: we can rock, too!"" moments, specifically ""A
    Whisper"" and the lite-apocalypse of opener ""Politik"".  The latter essentially takes the blueprint of
    ""Yellow""-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious
    song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance.  Martin's double-tracked vocals
    hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with
    is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box.

    Part of the blame for moments like these rests on producer Ken Nelson, who doesn't seem to know what to do
    with the band's expanded sound this time out.  He alternately dries up the quietest passages and drenches
    the louder sections with Martin Hannett-sized reverb tides.  It takes a lot of discretion to handle that
    sound, and the folly of Nelson and the band (who co-produced) often comes at the expense of the vocals,
    which frequently get lost in the haze.

    And that's a shame because vocalist Chris Martin has improved since the band's not-so-humble beginnings--
    his voice is dramatically fuller than in the past, and he falters less on the higher notes.  But, of course,
    he's still far from foolproof: at times, his attempts to broaden his palette don't pan out, such as during
    the regrettable midsection of ""Clocks"", where he barely bothers to add a melody to the central lyric ""nothing
    else compares.""  To his credit, he does manage a pretty good verse melody here, but then he oddly shies
    away from what should be the hook at the end, tentatively trailing off as though he's not sure it's
    good enough.

    That could very well be the case, too, as it's been widely posited that Coldplay nearly didn't make this
    album at all, fearing that they didn't have the depth to provide an adequate follow-up to their debut. I'll
    avoid the obvious cheap shot there and instead offer that they indeed still might.  Parachutes proved
    that Coldplay have at least a nascent songwriting capability, and A Rush of Blood to the Head shows
    them testing themselves musically, so it seems logical that if their third album were to combine those
    strengths they might finally start to sound like the band the UK press is always going on about.

    After over a half-dozen listens, I still haven't taken anything away from A Rush of Blood to the Head
    (by contrast, I recognized Parachutes' ""Don't Panic"" for the relatively tight song it is after hearing
    it once), and my girl, who was much more a fan of Parachutes than I was, sums it up as ""boring.""
    She's pretty much got it right.  Coldplay may claw their way back from this, but it'll be a pretty steep
    climb."
10077	11620	"The fantastical tale of King ""Bama Lama"" Khan begins in 1995, when the Montreal-born son of immigrants from India (and self-professed grandson of the opium-addicted ""Johnny Thunders of the sitar"") left home to play bass for the Spaceshits, a Cramps-linked garage-rock group fronted by Mark Sultan, aka future King Khan partner BBQ Show. A few years later, while in Germany Khan formed ""psychedelic soul big band"" the Sensational Shrines. By 2004, King Khan and the Shrines had played shows across Europe, along the way releasing not just a handful of 7"" and 10"" records, but also two full-length albums: 2001's Three Hairs & You're Mine, which was produced by White Stripes engineer Liam Watson, and 2004's Mr. Supernatural.
    Most people didn't hear about King Khan and the Shrines until last year, when What Is?!, their most recent LP for German label Hazelwood, seared the band's combustible combo-- Stax plus Nuggets plus hiss-covered indie-rock screwiness-- onto listeners' collective noggins. It was as if they were the Dirtbombs on simultaneous James Brown and Sun Ra kicks, or Black Lips with less of the Vice-ready comedy and more underlying pathos. Now signed to Vice, King Khan and the Shrines present a few of the best tracks from What Is?!, along with some of their earlier cuts, on label debut The Supreme Genius of King Khan and the Shrines. Despite the appropriately over-the-top title, it's not so much a Greatest Hits-- What Is?! has slightly better songs overall-- as a chronicle of how Khan became King.
    The strongest tracks, where the band's unhinged nostalgia meets not only squealing discord but also Khan's stupefying jester/soul-man antics, appeared previously on What Is?!. Take nourishment from the Hammond-drenched soul food-stamps of ""Welfare Bread"". Hear Khan go howling mad and a step past girl-crazy amid the sitar-like guitar and wah-wah pedals of ""I Wanna Be a Girl"". The string-tying absurdity of ""69 Faces of Love"", or the prickly dick jokes and ""Venus in Furs"" string drone of ""The Ballad of Lady Godiva"" are sadly absent, but the deafness-repping James Brown of ""Land of the Freak"", the Stooge-ian assault of ""No Regrets"", and the relatively sane red-line retro of ""Outta Harm's Way"" are all present and accounted for, as they should be.

    The seeds for that sound were sown long ago, as the older tracks on The Supreme Genius of show. The record opens where it oughta-- at a record store-- with the masochistic ""Torture"", originally from a 2000 7"". The ""she's fat, she's ugly"" chorus of 2001 10"" cut ""Took My Lady to Dinner"" loses its novelty sooner than some of the band's later ideas, and yet every time Khan sings about bringing home the bacon (or his special lady's Empire State-sized ass), well I just break down and laugh; queasy ballad ""Fool Like Me"", from the 2001 debut LP, finds similar redemption. ""Sweet Tooth"", off a 2004 split LP with the Dirtbombs, has the party ambiance of What's Going On, but it, like a few of the tracks on the second half of the album, shows a group not quite fully formed, lacking the self-awareness and depth of their best work. ""My heart is broke and I feel alone,"" Khan intones on 2003's ""Que Lindo Sueno"". Even at their worst, they're merely retro.

    It probably bodes well for King Khan and the Shrines that their best days aren't already, uh, years behind them. If you're a newcomer to their cracked vintage universe, The Supreme Genius of should be an excellent introduction, the band as they currently want the world to see them. If you arrived with What Is?!, this one might not get as many spins, but it'll still provide important context and a couple of tracks you probably hadn't heard. And if you've been listening to these guys since the Spaceshits...why the hell didn't you tell anyone?!

4062	18301	"Copenhagen's Nick Eriksen makes electronic music that's as playfully elaborate as his moniker, Taragana Pyjarama. Following a debut EP whose reliance on submerged samples smacked of chillwave, Eriksen signed to Kompakt for his more distinctive first LP, Tipped Bowls, where he expanded his software synths with limber analog hardware. It was a sunny and delightful deluge of clear but unusual shapes, with rich, high-contrast timbres and granulated rhythms swarming around house beats both implied and explicit. The Kompakt contract presumably goes on, and Nothing Hype, released on Eriksen's own Wyrd imprint, feels like a stopgap until then. It's billed as a ""mini-LP,"" though ironically, the longer Tipped Bowls got more into the miniature spirit. That almost demented level of fine detail thins out into broader strokes on Nothing Hype, an agreeable but less unique record.To get a sense of the difference between Tipped Bowls and Nothing Hype, check out each of their atmospheric opening tracks. On the former's ""Four Legged"", a panning notch smears a tone cluster as sub-rhythms bubble through, while on the latter's ""With Me"", a delayed chord progression glides along in a stately fashion, the accents accumulating on the beats instead of whirling and scattering across them. On the first, there always seem to be 10 things happening at once, while on the other, nothing much happens at all. This atypical complacency is elsewhere most apparent on ""PUR 1"", where a rubbery attack builds toward little more than some flanged harmonies and jammy synth intervals. These are smoothly pumping pistons, but Eriksen neglected to festoon them with tiny moving parts.Absent that intricacy, the dance tracks are the most engaging and liberated-feeling ones. The prancing ""RAR"", lush and sultry in the manner of  Dutch producer Applescal, is enriched by lingering harmonies that erratically well up, though it's hard to pick out any decisive climax or shift in their seven minutes of variable iteration. ""Touching"" makes for a dynamic highlight, though it sharply recalls a tamed version of ""Ribbons"" by professed Eriksen influence Four Tet. That leaves only ""Beam"", where a gently wobbling instrumental doesn't rise to the dramatic level of the vocalist, Kicki Halmos, and ""Lore (Merged)"", a small afterthought of a crescendo. Nothing Hype sets out its modest aims in its title, and the exploded diagrams of Tipped Bowls settle back into something more diagrammatic. It's a nice listen but not a very idiosyncratic one; one trusts that Eriksen is simply skimming off the top of his creative reservoir, already proven to be deep, until his next proper LP."
7651	14378	"Eric Bachmann has been making records for about 20 years now, and in that time, the economics of recording and distributing music have changed in every way imaginable. Bachmann was never on a major label-- Archers of Loaf released their records on Alias Records, and Crooked Fingers have split time between Warm, Merge, and self-releasing music-- but he still seems to have recognized that musicians need to be looking for alternative sources of funding for their projects. To pay for the recording and release of this EP, his second short collection of covers, Bachmann turned to Kickstarter.com, a site that lets artists, charities, community groups, inventors, and all manner of other people solicit donations for their projects. A donation gets you something in return, in this case anything from a high-quality download at the $6 level to a performance by the band in your living room for $2,500. (NB: Pitchfork publisher Chris Kaskie is an investor in Kickstarter.)Bachmann and his Crooked Fingers cohorts clearly made it well beyond their funding goal, enabling them to do a digital/vinyl release; this is the second covers EP the band has released, and for its modest ambitions, it delivers a lot. The focus is a bit different this time. Where last time, he included a huge hit (Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure"") and got a little outside the Crooked Fingers comfort zone by taking on Prince as well, on Vol. II Bachmann turns his sights on songs a little more naturally in his wheelhouse. Merle Haggard, Moby Grape, John Hartford (via Glen Campbell), Thin Lizzy, Billy Joe Shaver (via Waylon Jennings), and the Kinks all get the modern Americana treatment, and it more or less all works. It's also interesting to hear the band return to such a subdued approach after cramming Forfeit/Fortune with horns and European folk sounds.The golden-era country covers, Haggard's ""Shelly's Winter Love"" and Shaver's ""Black Rose"", are two of the most notable re-interpretations. Bachmann strips both of the the
So it's not perfect by any means, but it's a lovely extra for fans of the band, and the extra money it raised will go toward the band's next LP, possibly used to hire a few extra bouzouki players and gypsy brass bands (I hope). As much as I kid, though, I am curious whether this heralds a retreat from the fuller sound the band has pursued lately or simply a low-key diversion. It's not quite the essential piece of the discography that the first Reservoir Songs EP was, but it does enough to personalize the source material that it's worth listening to on its own merits."
3850	18492	"The concept behind Golden Tickets is generous and sweet. As Yoni Wolf explained on the Joyful Noise label's website, the EP is a collection of songs for and about specific WHY? fans. ""We would write a theme song for one customer who came to the [WHY?] web store and bought something every month... We'd read all about them on Facebook and Twitter, and sometimes even go so far as to contact their significant other to ask them questions. Then I would write the song on piano, and my brother would take the skeleton of lyrics & piano and turn it into a fully realized arrangement.""Those seven songs are collected here, on the Golden Tickets EP, and if I was any of these hardcore fans, I would be struggling with the uncomfortable question of whether my favorite band was personally mocking or belittling me. Part of the issue with these fan-specific valentines is unfair to Wolf but hard to ignore; Wolf's acrid delivery turns everything a little smarmy, which suits him well when he's addressing his favorite subject-- himself and his many faults-- but skews a little queasy when he's paying tribute to people who've done him the favor of repeatedly buying his music.If I were the fan who Wolf pays tribute to on ""Banana Mae"", for instance, I would have some serious questions.  Wolf opens with the room-clearing line ""Follow me, @banana_mae/ If you wanna see what I have to say/ now I'm only less than twenty-tre/ But I'll Twit a tweet to make your hair turn grey"" before offering an unflattering imitation of a stereotypical vapid, prattling teenage girl. Banana Mae gets the last laugh, though; the second verse is cobbled together from her own tweets, which ironically contain the only characteristically Yoni Wolfian insights to be found on Golden Tickets: ""I'm very impatient for science to figure out/ how I can clone myself and make the clone interact with my friends and family, it's tiring."" Or: ""I think the reason I don’t have any friends is ‘cause the people that I click with the best/ Also hate to leave their beds."" You can hear what she might like in Wolf's best writing.Speaking of which: For WHY? fans who are not the seven people selected as this EP's subject matter, these songs represent the nadir of the WHY? project. Every song begins with the character baldly introducing themselves: ""My name is Hunter Van Brocklin."" ""Well it's me, Dropjaw."" Or ""Peta E. Godfrey, I'm a bonafide Aussie."" The characterizations are less sketches of human people and more little sock-puppet retellings of the sort of basic biographical info you can glean from scanning a person's Facebook and Twitter: ""I was born to teach/ I do humanities/ Strictly public school, I think that should be the rule,"" he sings on ""Peta Godfrey"". Wolf's lyrics are bewilderingly lazy throughout: Hunter Van Brocklin is ""just a small-town boy in this big city"" and a ""a simple Southern man trying to find my fate."" Van Brocklin has ""fingers like a poem when they press the keys."" Fingers like a poem?Wolf has long been a shrewd, incisive writer, and his words have often borne testament to the virtues of mental sweat and finger-cramping rewriting. You could practically see the ghosted revisions hovering over a perfect line like ""God put a song on my palm that you can't read/ I'll be embalmed with it long before, you'll see."" ""I want that sharpened steel of truth in every word,"" he insisted on ""This Blackest Purse."" It's been awhile since we've seen that guy. On Golden Tickets, it sounds as if he's simply given up trying. There is one remaining golden ticket, by the way: ""The lucky person who receives this golden ticket will have a WHY? song written about him or her,"" the album page says. ""No foolin."" In context, it sounds like a threat."
11313	10304	"Can't Wait Another Day would be easier to love if it didn't keep accidentally signposting a shortage of fresh songwriting ideas. It can't help but feel symbolic when the Ladybug Transistor covers Trader Horne's ""Here Comes the Rain"", if only because the chorus is awfully similar to Jan & Dean's ""Like a Summer Rain""-- a song this band covered a few albums back. Only a pop geek would spend much time noticing that the next track is vaguely in the style of Twinkle's 1964 hit ""Terry"", except that said next track is titled...""Terry"". And you'd never think that the album's second-best track, ""For No Other"", feels a bit like a song called ""Rushes of Pure Spring""-- not unless you'd heard that one on the Ladybug Transistor's second album. Oh, I'm vastly overstating the case: These are dim resemblances, not steals, and the ""Here Comes the Rain"" thing is surely intentional. But they do seem to reinforce the sense of a band that's still sorting out where to head next, not yet nailing it down.
    They can be forgiven for that, especially after the departure of key member Sasha Bell. This is a figuring-things-out album, just as the vast Ladybug & Friends roster of guest contributions suggests: Even the label's advertising copy calls it ""a promise of good things to come."" The good news is that they'd seem to have their eyes on a new path. A few years after 1999's fantastic The Albemarle Sound, the group's high point of paisley-covered indie pop baroque, they took a few steps back toward rock's middle ground, as if worried that all those stately arrangements and flute breaks were going out of style; it's made them more popular, but less interesting. On this record, they make some firm, decisive gestures toward a new direction: Their usual lush, languorous sound picks up tinges of well-heeled folk and country, and a few big doses of the warm, sentimental Nashville sound Lambchop used to trade in.
    Bobby Goldsboro gets offered as one potential inspiration, and a listen to his 1968 hit ""Honey""-- lavished with strings, choir, and even theremin-- will explain the connection: Just compare with ""Lord, Don't Pass Me By"", the Ladybug Transistor's grand album closer. (Elsewhere, ""This Old Chase"" sounds, weirdly enough, like Ric Ocasek and the Cars going western.) This sound isn't in the least a bad fit: Singer Gary Olson is one of far too few guys in indie with the kind of rich, liquid baritone that can sell a slow, sad melody. That comes in handy through the rest of this record, too, which feels like a late-breaking, friends-and-all lap through the good old gorgeous: ""For No Other"" in particular is as deep and warm as anything they've ever done. When all those qualities come together with a solid song-- like the beautifully written ""Always on the Telephone""-- it's a real thrill, even before the astounding 80s-styled sax solo.
    When it comes to staking out a new direction, these are solid results: You can't help but wish them lots of luck in pinning down their new sound, lineup, and working method, especially after the recent death of San Fadyl, one of the more lovable drummers in indie rock. As an album, though, this one feels like a bit of a stall-- a little filler, a little room to breathe, and a little time to make plans. The band's years making friends and fans all through the indie and indie pop worlds mean they've earned enough credit for people to bear with them, and even enjoy their work in progress-- but here's hoping they'll plow their new furrow as fully, uniquely, and single-mindedly as they did with The Albemarle Sound. "
227	22378	Jim Adkins had written himself off. Judging from the open letter announcing Integrity Blues, the Jimmy Eat World frontman had spent the band’s first-ever hiatus soul-searching. For 15 years, Jimmy Eat World had been judged against their self-help smash hit “The Middle,” and this past April, Taylor Swift gave it a signal boost with an uncomfortably mixed message: “I used to listen to this in middle school!”  The expansive, emotionally weathered Integrity Blues sounds nothing like “The Middle,” but it’s perhaps their best record since then on account of being its unlikely spiritual sequel.It does feel odd praising Adkins for taking the initiative to actually write about himself, given Jimmy Eat World’s status to many as emo’s quintessential band. But unlike the other songwriters responsible for breaking emo onto alt-rock radio in early ’00s, Adkins never created a persona that made him inextricable from his music, allowing the audience rather than the author to inhabit the role of the narrator—this is why Clarity and Bleed American have aged much better than unearthed LiveJournals like The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most or Deja Entendu. But after Bleed American redeemed Jimmy Eat World commercially, their albums have been increasingly self-conscious and reactionary: the blue-black millennial malaise of Futures led to the peacocking radio-rock of Chase This Light; the band reunited with Clarity and Bleed American producer/donut innovator Mark Trombino for Invented, an ambitious and uneven collection of character sketches inspired by Cindy Sherman and Hannah Starkey photography. It led to another precipitous drop in sales and was followed by the streamlined Damage, pitched as an “adult breakup record,” but sounding complacent and AOR enough to soundtrack a date night movie at AMC Cinema.Their new partnership with Justin Meldal-Johnsen on Integrity Blues is both sensible and inspired: he’s worked on recent records for Paramore and Tegan and Sara, acts with emo foundations who are unrepentantly making rewarding pop now and Jimmy Eat World is as much a pop act as Carly Rae Jepsen is emo. Meldal-Johnsen is perhaps best known as the producer and bassist for M83—a band that sounds little like Jimmy Eat World, but still uses “can you still feel the butterflies” as an operating artistic principle, creating fantastical safe spaces in which teenage melodrama is a life-sustaining renewable resource rather than an escape.At least from a production standpoint, Integrity Blues is the exact opposite of what the title promises: it’s a complete fabrication of a four-person rock band, a proudly produced record where barely anything sounds like it does in its natural state. The guitar that opens “You With Me” is almost comically opulent, like a harp strung with liquid crystal and wrapped in icicle lights. Falsetto harmonies channel an ultralight beam through stained glass, sounding closer to the synth-prog hosannahs of Mew or Passion Pit. Every element of Zach Lind’s drum set is tweaked with crackling EQ and Rick Burch’s bass is a pulsating synth bubble. And yet the modesty that would often dulled and sanitized Chase This Light and Damage provides necessary heft on Integrity Blues. “You With Me” still feels like four guys in a room.Integrity Blues is in the exquisite, crystalline mold of “Polaris” or “Ten” and they’ve never successfully spent the majority of any album in this mode until now. The rumbling exposition of “Sure and Certain” and its choral liftoff nods back at professed superfans Chvrches, “It Matters” is unusually slinky and guitar-free, “Pretty Grids” is damn near translucent. Elsewhere, they prove deft and evoking their past glory without rehashing it: actual adult breakup ballad “The End Is Beautiful” is a crossbreed of “Hear You Me” and“Cautioners,” and Jimmy Eat World can still write spring-loaded, major-third melodies (“Through”) and add to their flawless run of 6+-minute epics (closer “Pol Roger” is “23”going on 40). The deceptively worded “You With Me” (“what makes our love so hard to be/is it you or is that you with me?”) is also indicative of Adkins’ subtle and progressive growth as a lyricist. Freed from the narrative strictures that Damage and Invented couldn’t support, Integrity Blues unpacks an adulthood spent “destination addicted,” whether the arrival is financial, romantic or even emotional success. At times, it’s almost like he’s ripping up the lyric sheets of his past—20 years after “Episode IV” promised a chance to dance all night, Adkins sneers, “But that’s something we never do...there’s my dream, doesn’t that sound good to you?” “Our weakness is the same, we need poison sometimes,” went the refrain on Clarity’s intoxicating “Ten”; Integrity Blues' frostbitten title track declares, “no one’s making you spend lonely nights poisoned through and through.” Even in his less resolute days, Adkins was always a try-hard type, and and his new bootstraps mentality can aggravate that impulse: the thematically impenetrable “Pass the Baby” creeps from a monotone, no-fi electronic lurch to math-rock pummeling, a reminder that Adkins once branded himself a Jesus Lizard ripoff artist and proof that menace and obscurity are the opposite of what they’re good at. Lead single “Get Right” serves as Integrity Blues’ thesis (“disguised as patience, time gets wasted”), but it's probably the least compelling Jimmy Eat World single ever released.It’s immediately followed by one of their best; “You Are Free” is earnest and comforting, on the edge of cloying, and unabashedly anthemic—like all of Jimmy Eat World’s best songs, it tells you what you need to hear right when you’re vulnerable enough to hear it. “Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads and ways we go around what’s one step from our face,” Adkins sings. “You Are Free” echoes the sentiments of “The Middle,” but not its belief that “everything will be alright”—it can be, if you’re willing to accept your responsibility.Though Jimmy Eat World hasn’t had much part in the ongoing renaissance of emo—in fact, some of it may be a reaction to what Bleed American hath wrought—Integrity Blues finds itself sharing its dominant concern of using the genre’s inherent vulnerability and introspection to promote self-esteem rather than self-pity. Summarizing his view of integrity, Adkins sings, “It’s all what you do when no one cares,” on the title track, written during a brief solo tour where he played to small crowds in bars and churches in places like Billings, MT and Maquoketa, IA. It’s indicative of Integrity Blues’ diamond-cut polish that this is the rawest thing here—while Adkins is backed by tearful Sigur Rós strings, his vocals are completely unadorned, possibly even first-take. It just took some time, but we’re finally hearing what Adkins has to say for himself.  
5822	16273	"Paris-dwelling DJ and producer Fetisch, who makes up one half of Terranova with the Berlin-based house and techno-oriented artist &ME, could no doubt spin a yarn or two about pivotal events in the history of club culture. If you're looking for someone who's been there, done that, and has all the scars to prove it, Fetisch is your man. He's spun records at Danceteria and Tunnel in New York; recorded at Conny Plank's legendary Cologne studio; found himself at the epicenter of the original illegal rave boom in England; and worked with Manuel Göttsching, Tricky, and Ari-up from the Slits. Their latest record even features a bizarre cameo from German horror and exploitation actor Udo Kier. It's clearly a career that bears no particular focus or shape, with the many-sided tracks on Hotel Amour spinning off from the all-embracing approach Fetisch has gleefully wallowed in over the years.As such, this is a record with a handful of standout songs struggling and straining against one another after being crammed into the standard album format. It feels like a collection of tracks screaming for individual attention, like precocious children all holding their hands up at the same time in class. The strength of Terranova's vocal collaborators are the primary cause of that, with Fetisch and &ME drawing on some fiercely individual talent. Copenhagen-based singer Tomas Høffding leaves a sizable imprint, in particular on ""Question Mark"", which is positioned somewhere between the blubstep croon of Jamie Woon and Antony Hegarty's work with Hercules and Love Affair. Elsewhere, the soft vocal intonations of Khan lend Hotel Amour the aura of post-rave comedown, particularly on the blissfully understated ""So Strong"".The stylistic thrust of this album is caught somewhere between the current and the deep past, with shades of modern pop production layered over the stripped-back grooves of vintage house. There aren't too many straightforward club bangers here, but there are a few old school thrills to be derived from the undulating TB-303 bass ripples of ""I Want to Go Out"" and ""By My Side"". But taking such an unabashedly retro approach on certain tracks feels jarring when Terranova strive to be forward-thinking elsewhere. ""Take My Hand"", the standout here, is all coarse, sputtering rhythms, clattering tin-pot drums, and heavily dubbed-out vocals. The closing ""Prayer"", featuring Kier's glowering spoken-word extracts and a straight-down-the-line piece of torch singing from German vocalist Nicolette Krebitz, is driven by the same kind of ambition DJ Hell was stirring up on his outstanding 2009 album Teufelswerk.But those tracks are mostly anomalies, with too much of Hotel Amour sinking into territory that has been heavily mined in recent times. Billie Ray Martin gives an impressively robust vocal performance on ""Make Me Feel"", but there's nothing in the limp backing that elevates it beyond the bevy of pallid trip-hop clones that clutched hard to the coattails of Massive Attack's Blue Lines 20 years ago. There's been a deluge of producers striving hard to work a darker edge into their material over the past decade, and it feels like it will take something very special to stand out in a marketplace bursting at the seems with alleyway-dwelling artists scrambling to translate early-morning post-ecstasy cityscapes into song. This isn't that record, but in ""Take My Hand"" and ""Prayer"", there is a way out of the gloom, providing some distance from the genre mimicry it ducks into elsewhere."
11815	9766	"Since Helios' Eingya is the third full-length by Boston-based
    composer Keith Kenniff, and the second from the same alias (Corduroy Road
    was released under the name Goldmund), you can't accuse him of not being
    serious about his work. Nor can you call him a dilettante or moonlighter: He's
    a Berklee College of Music grad who's served time since childhood in music
    lessons administered by a musically-inclined father (instead of playing outside
    or whatever), and his accomplishment and expertise on various instruments is
    gratifyingly apparent on all three of his releases.
    But though Boards of Canada-jonesing listeners hailed Eingya when it
    was released last year as the ambient classic they'd gone however many years
    without, a cursory listen to the record showed that Kenniff at least thought
    he had a story to tell beyond the texture of his sound. Press materials alluded
    to European travel and a fascination with cinema to explain the record's
    narrative arcs, which was giving either too much credit or not nearly enough,
    depending on how much you liked what he ended up with.
    When I first listened to Eingya it was mostly to
    ""Vargtimme"", a grindingly borderless, AM-station bit of noise that
    updated Eno and partnered well with NYC-drone duo Growing, who often work in
    the same just one sound vicinity. This was the lone spot on the album
    that didn't try to move me along to the next, which I appreciated. And I dodged
    the rest of the album-- save a few tracks incorporating field recordings of
    birds chirping and the like-- because it felt pushy: Upswells, dramatic builds,
    and arcs so familiar as to be meaningless, or worse, were all I could hear once I
    caught the trick.

    Returning to the record, other things caught my ear. I wondered
    at the formally traditional guitar sound of the latter half of ""The Toy
    Garden"", an elegant and composed break from the song's otherwise heavy
    synthetic texture; the hollowed-out flute sounds that begin ""First Dream
    Called Ocean""; and the bell-toned riffs that carry ""Paper Tiger""
    into its flat bass-toned denouement. In any one of these sounds I could have
    remained.

    Kenniff is trained as a percussionist, which might explain Eingya's
    forward-motion embrace, or we may have to give credit to the abhorrent
    ""taking in influence from his knowledge of cinema"" touted as a virtue
    in his press materials. My guess is the answer lies somewhere in between: Kenniff
    fits his movements to moods and classic shapes because it never occurred to him
    not to do so. And why not? Already he's in the business of making
    close-listening materials for an audience that likely hears his stuff via MP3s
    over computer speakers; spinning his music as more than just sound might be an
    unconscious survival mechanism.

    Likely there's no fault here at all, except with this reviewer. My wishes
    for bedroom laptop music often seem opposed to those of its creators. I wish
    they'd worry more at their own subjectivity. Instead, I feel as though they
    impinge on mine.

14193	5626	"Sometimes an album sounds better if you don't know its artist's name or its song titles. Just Google ""bukkake"" and then pray for your mortal soul's destiny. The self-canceling album title doesn't help, and neither does the obligatory freakfolk vibe of songs titled ""Enter the Wang"", ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"", or ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"". If I never knew these fouls, then maybe I would consider the Master Musicians of Bukkake to be one haunting artifact unearthed from the crates of a Bangkok record shop/noodle house/bordello in the back.

    The Master Musicians is a motley assemble of 20 blokes from subterranean Seattle who generally perform lysergically poisoned impressions of Southeast Asian ceremonial music. Alan Bishop and Charlie Gocher of ethnodelic greats the Sun City Girls add some drums and Burmese banjo in there. Visible is best heard in one sitting as it follows a narrative from wearied peace to phantasmagoric horror to entrance to heaven.

    Opener, (cough, cough), ""Enter the Wang"" fires the gong with faint Asian pentatonic string scales letting everyone know that the curtains are drawn and much madness follows. ""Bukkake Sunrise"" first bleeds in what sounds like a cross being a machine eating a tape and rain on tin. Blues guitar melodies that overlook a dust bowl arise while tribal chants echo throughout, beckoning one out of slumber and tempting that person to crawl out his or her bedroom window to follow the sound. The earth then swallows up the seeker.

    ""Lucky Duck"" loosely recalls the Balinese monkey chant, as scattered Master Musicians arise from the ashes to curse in ululating chants all punctuated with tribal thumps. However, the melodrama kicks in with the following, ""Pipestone Octopus with Horseheart"" interrupts the album's flow with Residents-style orientialism with screeching and wails blown through the nose. The children's Halloween record vibe fares better on ""Horseheart Revolution"" and ""Black Bile"", where the chants are awash in the village fires.

    Midway through the LP, ""Hidden from the Hidden Ones"" gathers the delirium into a natural tension with a drum march to the sacrifice altar and Faust-like violin grindings driving the momentum. ""Custody's Last Battle/Secret Wars"" is the peak; gunshots pierce through an open-air recording as dribbling percussion and screamed ""aiees"" flee the battlefield. An obligatory catharsis, I suppose. Closer ""Circular and Made of the Earth"" resolves the whole delirium with a feel-good ballad of accordion drones and sitar-stylized banjos plucks in perfect tune with an enraptured bloke speaking in tongues.

    Cynics can consider this music to be another example of Westerners trying to be weird by exploiting ""exotic"" and ""mysterious"" Asian music. That accusation does have substantial evidence, but this music should not be dismissed so quickly. The majority of the music is still well-executed and can engross listeners with a sense of otherness. Just don't look up ""bukkake,"" for the love of God."
16144	6	"Can there be any purpose behind a master's degree in the psychology of music other than inevitably attempting
    to rule the minds of men through the manipulative powers of sound?  I submit that there can not; the job
    prospects from a degree like that are, like, what?  Music therapist?  I don't think so.  The only career
    I can imagine it successfully leading to is Supervillian.

    It doesn't take a superhuman intellect to see
    through the aims of Jon DeRosa's education-- he's the arch-mastermind behind the warm, homey folk of Pale
    Horse and Rider, and has guested on several other records, including Debridement, a recent Chairkickers
    release by Rivulets.  But none of his various projects are more dangerous, more insidious, than the icy calm
    of Aarktica's dreamy ambiance.  In fact, his nefarious desire to lull listeners into a pliant, peaceful
    daydream (and then rob them, no doubt-- or worse!) could easily have succeeded with last year's Or You
    Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway if it weren't for the heroic actions of
    Pitchfo...  hey, wait.  That got a really positive review...  uuuhhhh.... now... that... I think about it,
    Pure Tone Audiometry is really... pretty...  oh, god, no...  if I don't come back, tell
    Kathleen Hanna... I... love... her...

    Wow... where was I?

    I always get distracted by the lush, diffuse tones at the conclusion of ""Out to Sea"".  The track opens Pure
    Tone Audiometry with a delicate, Magnetic Fields-ish male/female vocal dynamic between DeRosa and
    Lorraine Lelis, as they sweetly harmonize over the romantic notions of being lost at sea and never again
    seeing home.  Before long, the voices become lost in the hazy ambiance completely, and the experimental
    pop is vaporized; only Lelis' seraphic call remains to try and navigate the listener through the droning
    fog.  Eventually, even the music itself vanishes.

    DeRosa's arrangements are intensely careful and subdued, and never once does he allow his deliberately
    constructed tranquility to be disturbed.  The few real swells of emotion are thrilling, but momentary;
    such an austere, clinical tone is produced that it sometimes becomes stultifying, although I'm not sure
    emotive response is the aim here.  Aarktica is cold, pure, and almost inescapably tranquil.

    ""Snowstorm Ruins Birthday"" revisits the vapor that lingers from ""Out to Sea"".  There was music here,
    but now only traces remain, surrounding the listener in a wintry mist of component sounds, atomic gray
    noise, a touching (but still distant) pop melody dissolved into its basic elements.  Slowly, song structures
    reform; DeRosa's wispy vocals return alongside Lelis' stunning accompaniment, triumphantly welling up from
    miles beneath the faintly reverberating electric and simple acoustic plucking in ""Ocean""'s beautiful climax.
    ""Big Year"" explores the darker regions of Aarktica's ethereal shoegazing like a slightly cheerier version
    of Projekt-based ambient artists Lycia; the listener is inexorably pulled deeper into the track's echoing
    maze of acoustics, subtly ominous drones, and trembling strings.

    Until... total silence?

    No, wait.  Not total.  DeRosa slipped up; ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is a five-minute foray into
    ultra-minimalist drone, just a rhythmic pulse wrapped in a barely audible hum, before eventually bowing
    out completely.  The sheer vacancy of what amounts to little more than empty space is pretty unnecessary,
    and though it's anything but jarring, it still stands out as a glaring hole in an otherwise pristine calm.
    As a breather before ""Williamsburg Counterpoint"", Pure Tone Audiometry's twelve-minute centerpiece,
    ""Water Wakes Dead Cells"" is briefly very effective.  By the halfway point, though, the album's hypnotic
    spell has been broken-- it served as an anticlimactic pause, but after a few minutes, it just seems like
    a good time to get a drink, to make my escape.

    Ah, who am I kidding?  Aarktica's attempt to pacify and control his audience into a narcotized lull is good
    but not perfect.  Of course, it's too late for me, but at least you've been warned.  Jon DeRosa is a madman!
    He wants to control the world with his beautiful, antiseptic melodies!  He's nearly succeeded yet again!
    Tell the world before it's too late!"
17751	4727	"The Pitchfork staffer originally assigned to write a review of Lemon
    Jelly's EP collection determined that he was too cool for the job. And I have
    to agree. The guy gets sent demo recordings from Icelandic bands seeking his
    guidance/approval on material for their forthcoming albums. Rumor has it that
    Stephen Frears consulted him about what vinyl should be prominently displayed
    during High Fidelity.  He's too cool to even wear vintage RayBan Aviator
    shades!  Suffice to say, he's too good for this.

    So Lemonjelly.ky was passed to me-- apparently because my cool-to-nerd
    ratio needs major improving. Though I haven't yet got what it takes to carry
    off designer stay-press suits, I feel comfortable in my facsimile RayBan
    Aviators. But even I'm too cool for the lurid banality of this record.

    This compilation of three EPs' worth of downtempo ditties aims for the same
    market that scarfed up The Beta Band's Three EPs disc, but the
    similarities swiftly end there.  The packaging is lush, deluxe and probably
    shortlisted for a graphic design award, yet Lemonjelly.ky's nine
    tracks consist largely of samples from atrocious Nana Mouskouri songs and
    soundclips nipped from 100 Strings' mood music albums.  What binds these
    samples together is a series of predicable hip-hop beats and root-note
    basslines. In the UK, Lemon Jelly are probably pin-ups for a certain type
    of elitist freshman who considers himself ever-so superior for conspicuously
    enjoying this stuff.

    By arranging Lemonjelly.ky in chronological order, we can at least
    appreciate that by July 2000's The Midnight EP, it had at last occurred
    to the duo of Fred Deakin and Nick Franglin that splicing Bert Kaempfert with
    drum machine presets wasn't going to get them the St. Tropez mansion they'd
    been promising themselves since The Bath EP was released in August 1998.
    I get all mangled up inside about Lemonjelly.ky as a whole, but it's
    The Bath EP that gets me frayed. ""Nervous Tension"" samples a relaxation
    tape monologue which, unironically, has the opposite effect on my well-being.
    The only person who might be truly thrilled with ""A Tune for Jack"" is Jack
    himself-- the rest of us can live without hearing Johnny Pearson's Sounds
    Orchestral version of ""Wichita Lineman"" mixed with the hypothetical beats
    of the Captain & Tennille's deck-shoe shuffling version of Young MC's ""Bust
    a Move"".

    ""The Stauton Lick"" heads back into instructional tape land for a lesson in
    basic folk guitar techniques, and ends up sounding like a 14-year old imagining
    Fairport Convention covering New Order's ""All the Way"". ""His Majesty King Raam""
    is the sick fantasy of two thirty-something Brits-- a kindergarten tale broadcast
    on the BBC's Jackanory program enhanced with Henry Mancini's ""Days of
    Wine and Roses"".

    After these trite and scoffing appropriations of bad taste, the Midnight
    EP seriously engages.  Here, Lemon Jelly have gotten beyond novelty value and
    begin to layer elements, and to distill some palpable beauty from their thrift
    store sources. Thus, ""Kneel Before Your God"" threads folk guitar lines with
    delicate turntablism and seraphic synth lines; ""Page One"" is skittering,
    piano-driven, and club-ready.  And the guys display hitherto unexpected
    restraint during ""Come"", in which they refrain from lubricated smut in favor
    of a sparse, harmonica-led treat. It's almost as though the schoolboy graphic
    design team within the duo has been partially defeated by their adult musician
    personas.  But the rout is merely an incipient one; this more mature Lemon
    Jelly is far from being a confirmed victory for subtle moderation.

    Because the three tracks that comprise the Midnight EP rely far less
    on snickering, snobby kitsch, we can hope that Lemon Jelly will eschew juvenile
    mockery and perfect their technique. Only then will Deakin and Franglin
    overcome the tossed-off vapidity of Lemonjelly.ky and take their place
    with chill-out's recent masters.  Of course, if the band choose to further
    investigate bad taste, they'd better consult WFMU's outsider music expert
    Irwin Chusid, and study Stock, Hausen & Walkman's considerably cooler Organ
    Transplants series."
3076	19368	Austin foursome Future Death are the second band to name themselves in honor of the third best Flaming Lips album—and, like the first such group, they share very little aesthetically with their source inspiration beyond a root interest in the collision of melody and noise. However, while the band is barely two years old, it’s not premature to suggest that Future Death are capable of pulling off a Lips-like evolution from acid-punk misfits to balloon-popping art-rock visionaries.Like their 2013 self-titled EP, Future Death’s debut full-length Special Victim favors unapologetically tinny, distorted production that suggests it was captured on an iPhone Voice Memos app and replayed at internal-speaker-frying volume. (It was actually recorded at a former Dallas funeral home-turned-studio owned by indie super-producer John Congleton, possibly from inside one of the leftover coffins.) But rather than flatten out their sound, the limited sonic range mostly accentuates the increasingly sophisticated songcraft trying to poke through the surface squall.Much of that first EP was written by drummer Alton Jenkins and guitarist Bill Kenny prior to the arrival of bassist Jeremy Humphries and Craiglist-sourced vocalist Angie Kang—and yet, the fact that Special Victim was a complete group effort only serves to amplify the band’s inherent contradictions. Future Death often sound like a band at war with itself, exhibiting the form of a prog-rock act but the lo-fi ferocity of a garage-punk band, as Kang’s beaming, sugar-coated melodies are brutally pushed around by the convulsing arrangements like a pinball permanently caught between two bumpers. With the blissfully berserker opener “Riot Trains”, the joyride abandon of “Basements”, and cymbal-crashing fireworks of “Roman Devices,” Future Death effectively pair the in-the-red assault of Perfect Pussy with the see-saw, guitar-scrambled sing-alongs of Marnie Stern, rendering anarchy and ecstasy as one and the same.The pancaked production doesn’t always complement Future Death's songs; at times, it renders the band’s boundless energy as an indistinct blur. (In particular, the compulsively contorting “Speedweed” begs for greater clarity that would allow Jenkins’ oft-astonishing Zach Hill/Greg Saunier-inspired stickwork to propel the song, rather than be reduced to background clatter that clashes with Kang’s chorus line.) But you can also hear the band pushing against their preset parameters to open up their sound into unchartered territory: “Junkhummer” begins as a shrill, staccato math-punk pummel but, two minutes in, Jenkins trips up the beat and sends the song spinning off into a delirious extended coda, with Kang’s voice smeared into the sort of eerie, oscillating screams you’d hear from riders trapped on a malfunctioning amusement-park ride. In terms of confidence and scope (if not fidelty), Special Victim is an impressive step up from Future Death’s inaugural EP outing—but, as their band name not too subtly suggests, the truly killer stuff could still be to come.
15962	6734	"To one man, everything Lou Reed has ever released is absolutely perfect.  And if his interviews are any
    indication, that one man is Reed himself.  His vaunted intellectualism has always afforded him a final,
    unbreachable line of defense when one of his albums is subjected to criticism-- I mean, who are we
    to detract from Lou Reed's epic vision?  We, the insipid, the shortsighted, could never truly grasp the
    depth of artistry that goes into even the most seemingly hackneyed tracks from Ecstasy (particularly
    that of ""Like a Possum""), to say nothing of the deep harmonic layering in Metal Machine Music.
    ""If you had a small mind, you'd miss it.""
    You said it, Lou.
    ""I've been rewriting the same song for a long time.  Except my bullshit is worth other people's diamonds.
    And diamonds are a girl's best friend.""
    See, only Lou Reed can criticize Lou Reed; fortunately, he has only the kindest things to say about himself.
    He's been maligned for not understanding what he does best, and inadvertently playing directly into his
    weaknesses as a result, but I'm more inclined to think that he just doesn't care what other people believe
    his perceived strengths to be.  It almost makes me wonder why he bothered at all to hand-select and remaster
    the 31 tunes included on NYC Man, especially when such effort has been made to include material from
    even (to my ""small mind"") the worst of his later work.
    Here, studio versions of numerous mega-classics are replaced with live renditions, often denying listeners
    even that small pleasure of listening to these tracks with some small degree of studio clarity rather than
    stripped-down, emotionally dead reprises.  About the only unpleasantry he's spared us is sixteen minutes
    (and one second) of grating feedback-- er, I mean, deeply embedded classical melodies-- to represent
    Metal Machine Music.
    Still, like any of the greatest Roman emperors and European monarchs knew, the wrath of the mob is something
    to be avoided, and so the King of NYC condescends to include basically all the songs that will send still
    send him to the front of the line when rock's judgment day arrives-- most of which appear as live versions.
    ""Sweet Jane""'s gloriously faded core progression is one of the single most ripped-off blasts in rock and roll;
    the harrowing epic ""Street Hassle"" still sets a standard in orchestral rock augmentation that few bands can
    even dream of approaching.  The transcendent helplessness of ""Caroline Says"", the sultry decadence of ""Walk
    on the Wild Side"", the sweet fuck-all of ""White Light/White Heat""-- all the songs that have been included
    on every other Lou Reed compilation are here, too.  In some sense, the decision to include live takes of
    many of these songs would be preferable to offering yet another studio copy of ""Heroin"", if only Reed's
    lackluster, ""I'd rather be anywhere else"" live performances didn't so consistently wither in comparison.
    To give the man some deserved credit, though, it's hard to produce a ""bad"" version of a song as genuinely
    perfect as ""I'll Be Your Mirror""; it may be diminished here, but fundamentally, it remains one of the brightest
    jewels in rock's crown.  And so it is for all of Reed's most brilliant moments.  The bad news is, there's
    more here than just his most memorable work.  Now, to state that many of Lou's later albums are awful
    is certainly subjective on some level, but I sincerely doubt there's a person alive (well, aside from Lou)
    who'd be pleased with any collection that attempted to sum up his career by including any
    songs at all-- even just one, as this compilation does-- from rock-bottom tragedies like Mistrial,
    Ecstasy, and The Raven.  Unfortunately, after the necessary inclusions, that's about all he
    can do.
    So, rather than excise ""Rock Minuet"", the studio-alternate of ""Who Am I"", or any of the other relatively
    uninspired works of his later albums, and focus instead on his equally incredible, but more commonly
    overlooked 80s work-- or shit, just limited this thing to one disc-- he wildly over-reaches.  All possible
    opportunities for cohesion have been denied here at the expense of the implicit notion that all Reed's work
    is created equal.  It ain't.
    But you know what?  Lou really was a genius (maybe still is).  Even if his decisions make much of NYC Man
    a baffling ordeal, as albums go, the canonical rock and roll might contained in some of his greatest triumphs,
    even in second-rate form, save this album from the guillotine.  Such is the scope of his songwriting skill.
    This is Lou's career, all of it-- from The Velvets to The Raven-- as it could only make sense to him,
    3\xBD decades crammed into less than 3\xBD hours.  Take away any sort of chronology and then attempt to find
    representation from every release he ever crapped out, and all that's left is a strung-out, confusing mess
    that could have turned out a hell of a lot better than it did.  A hell of a lot like Lou, actually."
6334	15746	"Eight years ago, the smart money would've bet against Nick Thorburn becoming one of the more industrious alumni to emerge from the early-2000s Canadian indie-rock uprising-- his endearingly unstable former band, the Unicorns, could barely make it through a set without experiencing some sort of breakdown (be it technical or psychological). But while he has since emerged as the autonomous creative force behind the prog-pop ensemble Islands (tellingly, it was his face alone that graced the cover of 2009's Vapours) and recently released a low key solo album under the name Nick Diamonds (I Am an Attic), Thorburn has not forgotten what made the Unicorns so special: the alternately cheeky and tense dynamic between himself and ex-bandmate Alden Penner. As such, Thorburn has never shied away from the opportunity to match wits with a creative foil, teaming up with Jim Guthrie for the countrified Human Highway detour and, now, squaring off against Ryan Kattner-- aka Honus Honus of Philly carnival barkers Man Man-- in Mister Heavenly.Thorburn, of course, is no stranger to high-concept side projects (namely, his flirtations with hip-hop in Th' Corn Gangg and Reefer) and, on paper, Mister Heavenly initially reads like a similarly orchestrated lark. The band-- rounded out by Modest Mouse drummer Joe Plummer-- was reportedly devised around a self-explanatory sub-genre they dubbed ""doom wop."" The stunt-casting of actor Michael Cera as the band's bassist during their spring 2011 tour reinforced the assumption that Mister Heavenly would be a casual, low-stakes endeavor with which Thorburn and Kattner could amuse themselves before returning to their main gigs. But Mister Heavenly's Sub Pop debut proves to be something far more lasting and rewarding: Rather than serve as an outlet for their well-documented eccentric streaks, Thorburn and Kattner's good-cop/bad-cop dynamic yields some of the most tightly focused, immediately engaging songs either principal has produced.Ironically, it's Plummer's band that seems to wield the most influence on the outset, with Thorburn's ominously quiet verses on the opening ""Bronx Sniper"" yielding to an immodest, un-mousey grunge crunch and an especially Isaac Brock-ian howl from Kattner. But, as bracing an introduction as it is, the song's angst-rock ballast does not provide the best showcase of Mister Heavenly's charms. These are more readily revealed when the band settle down and put their modernist spin on early, pre-Beatles rock'n'roll balladry and 1960s tropical pop. Parallel-universe golden-oldies like ""I Am a Hologram"", ""Diddy Eyes"", and ""Hold My Hand"" may not fully live up to the transgressive promise of the ""doom wop"" descriptor but, like fellow 1950s-rock enthusiasts Black Lips and King Khan in their gentler moments, Mister Heavenly approach their AM-radio inspirations with just the right balance of devotion and deviance. (To wit, on the winsome title-track-cum-band-mission-statement ""Mister Heavenly"", Thorburn is not so much claiming to be the man of your dreams as resigning himself to the impossibility of living up to the matinee-idol ideal.)Out of Love's playful spirit sometimes crosses the line into unnecessary indulgence-- the rocksteady rhythm of ""Reggae Pie"" sounds like it'd be fun to groove on in the practice space, but probably didn't need to be featured as the album's longest track (complete with false ending), while the 98-second song that actually bears the title ""Doom Wop"" doesn't even attempt to honor either half of the equation. (Oddly, its sludgy slop-rock sounds uncannily like a tossed-off Ty Segall demo.) However, at no point does it feel like the players are simply using Mister Heavenly as a dumping ground for leftover song scraps they couldn't work into their primary projects: Every song here comes off like a true, collaborative union of the singers' singular personalities, with Thorburn's calm, childlike voice and Kattner's wizened old-soul rasp trading verses and choruses in surprisingly complementary fashion. The effect is mutually corrupting-- by the time we reach the wonderfully warped pen-pal exchange ""Pineapple Girl"", Thorburn sounds like the creepy one while Kattner acts as the stabilizing force. Really, no one would ever accuse Islands or Man Man of lacking character and presence, but once Thorburn and Kattner return to their bands after this dalliance, you'll be excused for thinking they'll sound a little bit incomplete without one another."
9135	12896	"Five years ago, Junior Boys-- Canadians with an eye on London's turn-of-the-millennium dancefloor innovations-- merged UK garage's sugary micro-programming with winsome synth-pop hooks and melancholy vocals on their debut album, Last Exit. The record made electronically attuned critics gush, but unlike a lot of supposed crossovers, you could also imagine the Boys reaching a wider indie audience: Frontman/mastermind Jeremy Greenspan and then-partner Johnny Dark learned well from their white-label heroes, while Greenspan's voice oozed a familiar strain of bedridden heartbreak.Yet Greenspan hesitantly distanced himself from comparisons to indie heartthrobs-- perhaps that's one reason why Last Exit failed to find the mass collegiate audience that turned the Postal Service into the 21st-century's indie-pop/electronic hybrid of choice. Junior Boys' sophomore LP, So This Is Goodbye, dropped two years later with a more traditional sound rooted in classy 1980s electro-funk, trading Last Exit's pinprick jolts of joy for the languid sadness of guys in sharp suits. Commercially, it seems to have been a canny move; a Carl Craig remix of ""Like a Child"" even brought an improbable Grammy nod. While So This Is Goodbye hardly troubled the Billboard Hot 100, it (deservedly) received some of the attention denied the acclaimed but under-heard Last Exit.Listening to the new Begone Dull Care, it seems the more straightforward synthetic soul of So This Is Goodbye will remain the Boys' template for the foreseeable future. Lush, sometimes to the point of textural overload, Begone is audibly the work of band that's now been honing its chops for a decade. Whatever its budget, the album definitely sounds like the product of million-dollar multi-tracking. That's helpful when you're referencing an era where even cheap keyboards could put a dent in the fattest bankroll. And listeners might also need to cash-in their pocket change for some swank studio gear if they want to fully enjoy Greenspan and partner Matt Didemus' delicately fussed-over handclaps and scissored vox and lugubrious call-and-response synths.That's not to totally discount the duo's talent as tunesmiths-- even if ""Hazel"" is the only thing here that might survive being thrown to the wolves of pop radio-- but sometimes Greenspan and Didemus' attention to detail is the only thing that redeems the album's occasionally sketchy songwriting. At Begone's weakest, the tracks could be easily dismissed as slickly assembled bouts of pre- and post-rave deja vu. The Tangerine-ian arpeggiated bass-synth pattern on ""Work"" is played-out, almost shtick-y, though the bell-like melody adds an eerie touch. But this slightly unexpected nod to old-school bleep techno bleakness, and Greenspan's latest turn as breathy dude-diva, isn't quite enough to sell a six-minute song to anyone but über-fans or audiophiles. Since I'm not much of an audiophile, but did consider myself an über-fan, I kept waiting for ""Work"" (and several other songs) to punch something other than my nostalgia switch. In vain, as it turned out.So what's Begone's draw, especially for those of us who fell in love with the affecting future-funk experiments of the Boys' early work? Well as mentioned above, it is hard not to marvel at how assured the Boys have grown as producers. The album's best tunes, like ""Bits and Pieces"", retain the mix of ennui and ebullience that marked early singles like ""Birthday"", but with minimalist restraint traded for so many perfectly placed period touches that you may have trouble picking out your favorite bit: Maybe it's the little glitch-hiccup breakdown? Or the saxophone that slides in mid-track from soft-rock central casting? If Begone is repeat-play worthy, and I'd argue it is, it might be down to the Boys' ever-growing skill as arrangers. (""Bits and Pieces"" combines maybe a dozen compositional elements without coming off like a claustrophobic cut-and-paste exercise.) And they're not averse to the occasional sonic curveball. (Is that a banjo on the whimsical ""Dull To Pause""?) Plus for all my grousing, it's hard to deny that the album's high-gloss shine can occasionally be seductive in its own right, at least if you've got love for a certain brand of glitz.Which leads to my nagging worry about the trajectory the Boys seem to be following. The weaker tunes on Last Exit were carried by the incongruity of their component parts; you overlooked an undercooked melody, say, because the band had come up with such a compelling and unexpected hybrid. As Greenspan and Didemus have settled into a classicist groove, they're running a risk well-known to their mid-80s influences. It was a short trip from well-produced woe into camp sterility, and well-regarded uptown aesthetes like the Blue Nile were always only a mixing board misstep from guys peddling digitized woodwinds for cocktail loungers. So when I call Begone Dull Care a ""mature"" album, know it skirts both the positive and negative connotations of one of the most divisive adjectives in pop's lexicon."
4772	17503	"King Louie's Drilluminati is the most high profile single-artist mixtape to come out of the Chicago drill scene since it exploded into the mainstream over last summer. It's a weird spot for Louie (or, for now, ""King L,"" at least until Epic Records sorts out some trademark issues with another artist) to be in, not only because of its the tape's nature, but because at this point he doesn't have much in common artistically with Chief Keef and most of the other rappers he's commonly mentioned alongside.While Louie was tied in with the drill scene before anyone outside of Chicago even knew it existed, he's never totally fit in with it. For one, at age 24, he's seven years older than Keef, which in this young scene almost counts as a generational gap. But more importantly, while Keef, his Glory Boys crew, and the ever-growing number of rappers imitating them project the image of dead-eyed sociopaths, Louie's always been a hedonist first and a street tough a far-off second--his long-awaited major label debut's been through at least a year's worth of delays, and it's still called Dope & Shrimp.As a mixtape released between a rapper landing a deal and the release of his first ""official"" album, Drilluminati is intended to fulfill several important functions. One is to sustain interest in King L between the signing and the arrival of a retail product, which is increasingly difficult to do. The other is to prove that he's ready to make the jump from the mixtape circuit to a much bigger arena. Kanye West's shout out to Louie in his remix of Keef's ""I Don't Like,"" which boomed inescapably from car windows and teenagers' cellphones last summer, did the heavy lifting in terms of sustaining interest. But Drilluminati acquits itself nicely in the second respect.King Louie's been waiting for years to get a chance to establish himself as a rap-world big dog, and on Drilluminati he goes out of his way to invite comparisons with the biggest dog currently running, Rick Ross. The fact that he named the opening track ""Rozay Flow"" makes it unmistakable, but its typically supersized operatic beat by Ross mainstays J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League (who also produced the similarly Ross-ish ""Feeling Like a Billion Bucks"") would have been a pretty serious tip-off by itself. And while his lyrics include a fair share of gun talk (although maybe not so much as to justify the grim, bullet-ridden cover art), Louie spends significantly more time assuring us of his aptitude for spending money frivolously, something that Ross proven an Olympian talent for.Louie seems to understand that, if he's going to make Rick Ross-level paper, it won't be by copying Rick Ross' style-- and he doesn't need to, anyway. His flow has the weird anarchic energy that you used to pick up in Ludacris verses and, these days, are more likely to find on something featuring 2 Chainz. He combines that energy with the clipped, gunfire-like enunciation of a Chicago drill rapper-- and when he finds his pocket, it feels like getting on the right beat at the right time is the only thing between him and pop radio.A few tracks get partway there. ""My Hoes They Do Drugs"" has verses from Pusha T and Juicy J, and DJ Pain 1's slo-mo synth psychedelia bears a squinting resemblance to Juicy's ""Bandz a Make Her Dance"", although its single entendre lyrics are maybe too on the nose even for a pop audience. Louie and producer Hearon Trackz work extremely well together on ""My Niggaz"", as Trackz provides a creepy minimalist beat decorated with blaring, Inception-style brass that Louie comes at with what's probably his strongest performance on the album. Even the requisite bedroom song, ""Bandz Up"", featuring an ostentatious hook from the R&B singer Leek, is surprisingly decent.Things get even more interesting on two songs in particular. ""2 Pair"", produced by Sonny Digital, takes a giddy synth loop and a rap from Louie at his most compellingly louche, and proceeds to pound it into your head and refuses to let up. The track should make listeners either wild out with abandon or dive for the stereo's off switch. And the previously released ""Val Venis"", with its rotund beat by the gifted Chicago producer C-Sick and an instantly memorable, infinitely enjoyable tongue-tying vocal hook, is something out of an A&R's dream. If anything on Dope & Shrimp matches it, Louie might just end up as big as he thinks he is."
6632	15457	"Before its vintage bass line arrives, the first we hear of ""Pebbles"", a mid-album highlight on Strange Hearts, is crickets chirping. They seem to stay for the entirety of the song. That's a testament to this North Dakota outfit's fondness for atmosphere, something they've managed to spread out evenly across all 11 of these 1960s-indebted harmonizers. ""Pebbles"", as if by design, sounds like it was recorded for transistor radio play. The bass is dewey. The harmonies are starlit. The theremin is ripe. And then there's the matter of MJ Parker's opening line: ""Pebbles, it's time to go home now/ The drag race is over/ You smashed up your car, and now our dream is over."" It's all draped in a nice, light fuzz.But as Real Estate, for example, use pools of reverb to give their songs their own sort of submerged ambiance, Secret Cities line their more contemporary sensibilities with a layer of fuzz for similar reasons. In this case, it's not at all about obfuscation and more in the service of added warmth. Some of that can be attributed to their decision to record Strange Hearts in the basement of a recently abandoned bank in Kansas City, but most of it's in the citrus-splashed feel of their songwriting. Opener ""Always Friends"" kicks things off with a light-footed guitar melody that-- just after they lace their second verse with some well-managed whistling-- gains strength as it goes. At the moment, Secret Cities find themselves in a lane with the Morning Benders and Grizzly Bear, the latter a band whose music, in juxtaposition, has a big brother-like energy to it.That's because in contrast, these three seem to have taken a less agressively tailored approach to tapping similar veins of the 60s. As they are on ""Pebbles"" or the shuffle of ""Love Crime"", Secret Cities live and die by period-specific vocal harmonies, as mastered early on by the Zombies and Shangri-La's, just to name a couple. But Parker and fellow vocalist Charlie Gokey, both with well-suited cords for this kind of stuff, enjoy a great deal of verve in the manic rhythms of Alex Abnos. The racket they're able to muster together in the process is enough to set them apart from the pack. A song like ""Ice Cream Scene"" takes a few hairpin turns before settling into a two-minute breakdown outro that's assertive and rambunctious enough to belie their twee-est of tendencies. Elsewhere, ""Brief Encounter"" metes out psychedelic fare that's equally muscular. Organs bounce. Voice entwines. Horns march in. It could signal a parade just as easily as a funeral. Lively atmosphere either way."
8016	14053	"Everyone more or less agrees on the basic building blocks of house music-- soul-pop vocals, R&B keyboards, disco rhythms-- but it seems the genre's leading lights practice it in the abstract: DJ Sprinkles' dubby ambience, Omar-S's solar funk, ­Moodymann's jazz loops. It's in this context that Motor City Drum Ensemble's Raw Cuts, Vol. 1 sounds so refreshing: It is straightforward, effusive dance music spun from the most basic of elements, and done very, very well.A showcase for MCDE's eponymous label, Raw Cuts, Vol. 1 compiles three Raw Cuts 12""'s, labelmate Jayson Brothers' debut single, and three exclusive tracks. Clearly indebted to the dance music developed in Chicago and Detroit since the mid-1980s, MCDE (Danilo Plessow, from Stuttgart, Germany) aligns himself with electronic musicians deadly serious about placing music before image. Fortunately, Plessow's music isn't concerned with evasion. Open and melodic, Raw Cuts overflows with warm electric keys and cracking rhythms. Tension is massed then resolved with big, descending chords and wily guitar. Looped vocals roam in and out of the mix like shouts from the other side of the floor.Plessow, though, isn't just toying with 1980s dance nostalgia. Raw Cuts often sounds like dance music constructed by and for people who grew up listening to dusty, 1990s hip-hop. His sliced-up funk and interlocking slogans make ""Raw Cuts #3"" sound like a dissertation-length exploration of a J Dilla beat. ""Raw Cuts #2"" could be a clear-headed, taking-their-medicine Avalanches jam. We associate madcap samplers like those with a certain skittishness, but Plessow's sounds are thrillingly, ingenuously focused.Brothers' contributions nearly split the album in two, both through their placement and their lingering funk. ""Monster Box"" is still electronic music, but its brawny shuffle sounds like it could be the product of a particularly amped backing band. ""All My Life""'s sunken steps provide a base for the symphonic-soul strings.The source material ensures that Raw Cuts never veers into giddy, Technicolor party music, and there are times when these tracks feel like a really great party viewed in sepia tones. Take that as you will, but a slightly muted great party is still a great party. Raw Cuts is your first opportunity to hear the young, ultra-talented Plessow on disc. His warm, everyman house music is as sturdy and lived-in as his adopted hometown."
1858	20696	"Everybody knows who Dylan and Cash are, but who the hell are the Nashville Cats?  The name doesn't refer to a band, but a loose collective of ace session musicians in the 615 area code during the 1960s and 1970s, when Nashville studios had a full-to-bursting Rolodex of some of the best pickers, fiddlers, drummers, bassists, dobro players, and pedal steel guitarists in the country. You might not know who Norbert Putnam is, or Pig Robbins, or Kenny Buttrey, or Buddy Spicher, but odds are you’ve heard them on records by the Byrds, Neil Young, Joan Baez, Steve Miller, three of the four solo Beatles, J.J. Cale, and Simon & Garfunkel, among others.""The Nashville Cats"" was a name applied retroactively to this scene by the Country Music Hall of Fame to lend shape and specificity to the moment. The new compilation Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats: A New Music City is a 36-track companion piece to the Hall of Fame's exhibit of the same name, and while the release is a little confusing to unpack, it doesn't diminish the power of the music contained in it. These songs are credited to well-known stars, but in this setting their names are less important than the ones behind them. Casually blurring the lines between country and rock, these session players helped to redefine pop music away from its coastal loci and re-settle it just north of the Deep South.Blonde on Blonde was the scene’s big bang: In 1966, Dylan decamped to Nashville to record at the CBS studios, hiring mostly local musicians to flesh out songs for what would become one of his best records. This was unusual at the time, as the only people making albums in the country music capital of the world were country musicians. Still, few could argue with the results, then or now. Representing that breakthrough album here is ""Absolutely Sweet Marie"", which sounds newly punchy in this context, with that crackling organ groove acting as a sly parody perhaps of the entire L.A. scene. In Dylan’s wake, more and more artists flew into Nashville for sessions, some with only a tenuous connection to ""country."" They might have sounded like mere tourists in Music City were it not for the so-called Cats who sound alternately funky and stately, majestic and gutterbound, lowdown and high lonesome.Many of these tracks are familiar to anyone with even a passing knowledge of rock history, but even the most popular tunes sound fresh in this context, as the session players push new sounds to the forefront. The ambient jaw harp on Leonard Cohen’s ""Bird on the Wire"" pops and crackles with a new vibrancy, lending the song an off-kilter edge. The song quietly malfunctions even as Cohen sings it. Dylan and Cash exert a heavy influence, with six tracks between them—including the duet ""Girl from the North Country"", and Cash emerges as a genially paternal figure, encouraging a new generation to push the boundaries of both country and rock.  It’s hard to imagine a man better suited to act as an ambassador.Many artists went to Nashville specifically to cover Dylan, and the well-chosen covers here show how his impressionistic lyrics gave session players license to invent new flourishes. The folk duo Ian & Sylvia brighten up his composition ""This Wheel’s on Fire"" even as the musicians instill the arrangement with subtle foreboding, as though they’ve spotted some ruination on the horizon. And the Byrds’ cover of ""You Ain’t Going Nowhere"" sounds both regal and randy, thanks to the way Lloyd Green’s spry pedal steel trips lustily around the song.Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats makes a fine primer on country rock, although fans steeped in the genre may find some of it redundant. While the compilers might have hunted for lesser-known or unreleased tracks (the only exclusive is an alternate take on Dylan’s ""If Not For You""), the bigger shortcoming is the lack of info on the individual session musicians in the liner notes. There’s very little about Buttrey, Spicher, Putnam, and their fellow Cats in the packaging, not even a listing of who plays on which songs. It doesn’t detract from the music, but such an oversight is odd considering how thoroughly the exhibit itself documents them individually. Like any good catalog, however, this album is an extension of the exhibit, not a substitute. Perhaps the best way to hear it is on your way to or from the Hall of Fame, where the exhibit is up through the end of 2016. "
8023	14024	"There's something almost charmingly old-fashioned about James Milne's U.S. debut as Lawrence Arabia. There's of course that cinematic pseudonym, alluding to a Hollywood epic almost half a century old. There's also his unyielding devotion to 1960s pop music, which treats the Beatles catalog as untrod territory. But mostly it's the New Zealander's steadfast refusal to join any current pop trend, indie or otherwise, which seems a bit surprising given that Milne has played with the Ruby Suns, the Brunettes, and Okkervil River. He distances himself so far from the present that he actually sounds somewhat distinctive. Pop history, however, is littered with those who have taken up the Fab mantle to high praise, from Jim Noir all the way back to Todd Rundgren and beyond.Which is only to say that Milne is no outsider. His well-schooled command of hooks and pomp does not make him unique, just obsessive and perhaps a bit single-minded. In fact, his debut's primary limitation is that for all his fifth-Beatle vocals and the loose Höfner plunk of his basslines, Chant Darling seeks to imitate, not to innovate. At times it sounds like nothing we haven't heard before, but there are, of course, pleasures to be found in this approach, like the snaky guitar and snappy hook of ""Apple Pie Bed"", the chipper calypso sample that forms the rhythmic foundation of ""Auckland CBD Part Two"", or the decadent languor of ""I've Smoked Too Much"". Milne lets a lot of ideas loose on this album, and occasionally they get away from him. In particular, he has a tendency to repeat phrases and melodies, striving for hynotic but more often achieving tedious. ""The Undesirables"" run its sleepy hook into the ground in just two minutes, and ""The Beautiful Young Crew"" tugs obsessively at its knotty melody.Lyrically, Milne can be slyly witty and genially self-deprecating, as on the opener, ""Like a Fool"". ""I'm on the ground, girl, I'm thrashing 'round,"" he sings. ""It's easy to see what this display is for, to show you what you mean to me."" In addition to anchoring him in the here and now, that sense of haplessness is at direct odds with the song's dapper arrangements; if his thoughts are scattered, his music remains suave and martini sophisticated. Chant Darling doesn't hit strike that balance often enough, and very few of these songs allow such a glimpse of the musician behind them. Ultimately, Lawrence Arabia's carefully tailored influences have the same effect as that stage name, as if Milne was intent on absenting himself from his own album."
10221	11479	"Animal Collective have followed each of their last three albums with a short companion EP closely related to its predecessor. 2005's Prospect Hummer echoed the bent acoustic folk-pop they'd explored on Campfire Songs and Sung Tongs; it also featured British folk legend Vashti Bunyan on vocals, who was then just returning to public consciousness. While Prospect sounded terrific from the start, 2006's People, which followed Feels, felt more like what it was-- a chance to release a few not-quite-as-good songs out that didn't make the cut. Now comes the Water Curses EP, which contains three tracks from the Strawberry Jam sessions and another recorded at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room studio.
    The opening title track ranks among the best songs the band has written in purely pop terms, alongside ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"", ""Grass"", and ""Fireworks"". The production is busy with snippets of what could be a gurgling bong, creaking floorboards, and laser-like effects, but it's mixed beautifully and remains light on the ears despite its density. With its de-emphasis on identifiable instrumentation (guitars are there, but they're way down in the mix), ""Water Curses"" seems unbound by genre or era, and serves as a nice reminder of how many risks Animal Collective is taking sonically these days. It's mostly electronic and it's pop, but it doesn't have anything to do with the 1980s, which in itself makes it unusual; it sounds like something no other band working right now could have made.
    Among the other three tracks, nothing else is nearly so direct melodically. ""Street Flash"", which has been a staple of live sets for a while now, begins slow with dubbed-out scraping noises and distant samples of loud vocalizations. The opening section is pure mood, as Avey Tare sings in his lower register to assorted sounds placed against a wide backdrop of silence, but then his voice is subjected to an underwater effect, some gentle piano enters, and things grow progressively thicker. The baby-like screams that he alternates with sweet crooning aren't going to win the band any new fans (they feel somewhat out of place in this more subtle track), but it's still an effective slice of ambience.

    ""Cobwebs"" is like a mid-tempo and more song-like variation on some of ""Street Flash""'s ideas; where the latter gets by on impressionistic drift, ""Cobwebs"" is like a slow march through a bucolic landscape, the clackity and deliberate percussion occasionally giving into a surging chorus. There's again plenty of intriguing sonic detail, and the track sounds especially good on headphones; with its bright, tactile production, the whole record is very visual, sometimes feeling like  a series of weird scenes glimpsed through the glass of an aquarium.  The aquatic motif returns on record closer ""Seal Eyeing"", which is anchored by a few notes of melancholy piano, and nicely wraps up some of the production ideas as they fold in the sound of the traditional instrument on a pretty, evocative ballad while maintaining an air of strangeness.

    Though ostensibly a collection of outtakes, Water Curses feels like its own thing, with a consistent mood and an identifiable palette. The record also finds the band becoming increasingly comfortable with integrating unusual sounds and textures into their music. Where they once used synths, delay pedals, and crude electronic percussion in an abstract, noise-oriented ways, they're now discovering how to make odd sounds work with proper songs. You can hear them becoming more experimental and more accessible simultaneously. While Water Curses is plenty enjoyable on its own, it also sets you dreaming about where Animal Collective will go next.
    "
6133	15949	"Milagres are from Brooklyn but they seem like a ""Brooklyn band"" in ways that that extend beyond geography. Despite those zeitgeisty triangles on the album cover, their debut LP, Glowing Mouth, brings to mind that period between 2005 and 2009, when the borough pumped out earnest rock bands that embraced ornate, occasionally anthemic song structures and on-the-cusp-of-turning-30 neuroses.Needless to say, things have changed since then, as James Murphy's decade-old jab about how ""your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables"" has more or less become reality (again). One of Brooklyn's remaining guitar bands, Real Estate, aren't really from Brooklyn, and elsewhere you're more likely to find piles of synthesizers and stoner-friendly visuals at a D.I.Y. show, anyway. Even that bastion of wistful, distanced indie-pop, Captured Tracks, has taken a turn toward largely embracing the harsh synth minimalism of coldwave. The sepia-toned M.O.R. Glowing Mouth, then, is almost tailor-made for those nostalgic for the days when nostalgia wasn't indie culture's M.O.-- or, for when tickets to see Grizzly Bear weren't too expensive.Calling Milagres ""fussy"" is only half the story, though. Glowing Mouth represents something of a collective split personality within the band, and they're at their best when embracing the high-stakes theater of emotional, mainstream rock. A recent article in The Guardian compared Milagres to Coldplay, which is half right, since if Milagres were half as playful and unabashedly romantic as Coldplay, they'd be a much more interesting band.There is a sort of distinctly British world-weariness to lead singer Kyle Wilson's voice, though, swinging and swaying toward the rafters while still retaining an elegant, low-level misery. A times, they recall the stronger points of Elbow's catalog (witness album closer ""Doubted"", where Wilson sounds like a slightly weakened dead ringer for Guy Garvey). If you've spent more than a minute of your life defending Doves, there are moments on Glowing Mouth that are pure catnip.In the end, though, it's Grizzly Bear's influence that looms largest over Glowing Mouth. There's plenty that brings Yellow House to mind, from the cavernous surroundings to the jagged, obtuse guitars on ""For Disposal"". Like records by Grizzly Bear, St. Vincent, and the National, nothing feels out of place on Glowing Mouth; it's precise and hermetically sealed to perfection, the kind of reasonably competent mid-2000s mainstream indie that inevitably finds an audience, no matter how small and blog-specific. But while Milagres may sound like a lot of music fans' favorite bands, it's hard to imagine anyone preferring this record to the real deal."
16938	981	"In case you don't know who Brute is: hang on to your indie cred,
    activate your patchouli filters, and then answer me this: why does
    Vic Chesnutt (who is so irrevocably cool) make records with
    Widespread Panic (who are so irrevocably not)?  I don't mean to
    over-refer to the car accident that handicapped Chesnutt, but he
    is a jalopist: his music peaks when it's wreckage-esque, arranged
    in a dangerous and fragile fashion that fits the stark goulash of
    his boondoggler-philosopher persona.  And here he is in Brute with
    the airtight Widespread Panic, who check every valve like purgatorial
    Pep Boys.  I wonder if Birkenstocks outnumber Campers at their live
    shows.

    For chrissakes, Vic Chesnutt was in Sling Blade!  Remember
    when drizznunk, moodswinging Dwight Yoakam slams Chesnutt's wheelchair
    into the door, almost capsizing him?  Sling Blade told it like
    it is-- showcasing power lines and potholes and crutches and fast food
    and armpit moisture, not Jennifer Love Hewitt in spaghetti straps bending
    over every six minutes.  Like Fargo or Lone Star, it
    presented a region as its frumpy self, and dadgummit, that's how I
    like my alt-country/avant-roots/No Depression/cowpunk/ya'llternative/thunderplink/asscord/shitporch.

    But on Cobalt, Panic fails to meet Chesnutt's dark vision
    even halfway. When the first song kicks in, you'll think you
    accidentally switched on an adult-contemporary station broadcasting
    a John Hiatt/Bonnie Raitt duet. The band's playing is clean, but
    straight-up soulless. What is it that their fans can't get enough of?
    ""Man, bro, hey, bro, shazam, these jokers are technically
    proficient!""  The showtune plod of  ""You're With Me Now"" would
    bring the house down at your older stepbrother's sparsely attended
    second wedding, the band keeping it real like the Carnival Cruise
    poolside karaokist.  ""Adirondacks"" starts with some Bob Seger electric
    piano before busting into a patented Counting Crows midtempo anthem;
    ""Scholarship"" offers guitar tones I haven't heard since Britny Fox
    broke up.  This music is tame, tame Southern Rock, like the
    honeysuckle bloat of late Drivin' n' Cryin'.
Cobalt triumphs only on ""Puppy Sleeps,"" a riff-anchored track
    with just enough ingratiating hangnail cracker-funk to transcend the
    Disney-does-Skynryd of its peers.  My molten downstairs neighbor
    knocked on my door, incense wafting from her absorbent pajamas-- I'm
    thinking she'd finally come to borrow a cup of love, but nope: ""What
    the hell are you playing that has that repetitive bassline?""  I
    pretended to be an exchange student house-sitting for someone much
    cooler.

    Yet, Chesnutt fans might wanna shell out their germy tender for
    Cobalt anyway, because Vic more than holds up his end of the
    bargain.  His befitting themes of figurative paralysis, inertia, and
    atrophy all get thorough re-examinations. The drearier songs offer no
    escape; they're full of armory machinists, carpet plants and flour
    mills, and they recommend bridges from which ""suicide is a cinch.""
    The maudlin harmonica of ""Expiration Day"" is dead-on: Vic namechecks
    W.H. Auden and weird Southern county names, and his plangorous voice
    is as ripe as ever, despite what the twinklestains on Amazon.com say
    in their customer reviews about how the vox ""leave alot to be desired""
    and aren't ""Widespread quality.""

    Vic loves him some Latinate diction, and he enunciates it so much
    better than the thesaurus-boys in Bad Religion and Lullaby for the
    Working Class, exaggerating the mouthfuls like a phonetic alchemist.
    When he sings ""stupid preoccupations,"" he sings ""a-steyoo-peyid
    eh-paree-awk-cue-payaysheyuns.""  He continues to view the world as
    an equation (a habit he's had since the songs on his 1988 debut
    Little), condemning drug-culture friendships with the line,
    ""All we have in common are psychoactive compounds,"" on ""All Kinds,""
    a classic peep at the problem of evil that harps on kiddie porn and
    ""stale mounds of semen.""  But the overwhelming keeper is his new
    arrangement of old song ""Cutty Sark.""  Panic performs a warm and
    subdued Lambchop impression, and the lyrics are a gold amalgam of
    Chesnutt's tendency to throw images together and see what happens--
    a style that too often results in songscapes rather than songs,
    soundscapes that are often barren despite their crowdedness.

    If this record had a dozen more like ""Cutty Sark,"" I'd be lobbying
    for a 9+ rating and its subsequent canonization, hippie caravan
    and all.  Hell, you can tell just by the pictures that stubbly,
    pensive Vic is the tormented bomb while Widespread are bootleg, all
    smiling with their flowing manes, ballcaps, and Reeboks.  If you want
    an endearing jalopy, get the Ugly Casanova CD.  If you're a die-hard
    Vic-ophile, get this anyway and make your own faux-folk cover art.
    Otherwise you'll be as embarrassed of Panic's presence as you are of
    that girl you made out with because she looked like Jeff Tweedy."
7543	14503	"Christopher Willits is a guitarist, but only in the sense that it's his primary instrument. Willits is, in fact, a painter, as well as a multimedia artist. (His biography also attributes such titles to him as ""teacher"" and ""meditator."") Much of Willits' music is created through self-designed software, which means that he manipulates the conduit that manipulates his guitar-- he paints with his guitar. In a way, Willits is more of a grand manipulator than a musician, since what is paramount on Tiger Flower Circle Sun is how the guitar sounds, not so much the notes being played.Tiger Flower Circle Sun is an ode to guitar sounds. Especially heavily processed guitar sounds. On ""Light Into Branches"" alone, there are the clean fingerpicks of an acoustic guitar; the warped, rubbery windings of mid-90s John McEntire-produced post-rock; creaky stoner rock soloing; and lasery, searing mid-70s paeans to Robert Fripp. The album more or less functions in this fashion: Willits takes guitar sounds-- some familiar, some not-- and rearranges them in such a way that they become a collage (there are also occasional vocals and drums, neither of which sound as belabored as the guitar does). But since Willits constructs his own software, he cannily edits the material so that it doesn't sound disjunctive or incongruous. In that respect, the album is seamless.Yet underneath the impressive imitations and impressionistic imagery is... well, that's the rub. Though the sound design of both the individual elements and the album as a whole is often superb, there isn't much more than prettiness. Maybe it's that so many of the guitar sounds here feel so familiar to anyone with some knowledge of textural guitar music (and the audience for which this album seems to be targeted in all likelihood possesses said knowledge). But mostly, it's just that Tiger Flower Circle Sun doesn't seem to have much of a purpose beyond being aesthetically pleasing-- and that lack of depth is not immediately noticeable, but it's a nagging concern that is exacerbated over time.The title reminds me of one of my all-time favorite albums: Boredoms' Vision Creation Newsun. That title perfectly imparts the aesthetic and purpose of what Boredoms sound like they were trying to achieve, showing how both primitive and contemporary styles of music could be united in their cosmic search for catharsis. Whereas here tigers, flowers, circles, and the sun all seem to have correlations to the sound of the album, but no deeper meaning. Tiger Flower Circle Sun is a pleasant mishmash of pleasant sounds, executed with noteworthy skill. The question for Willits is, knowing that he has the ability to create these sounds with such accomplishment: What else is there?"
15923	190	"The last time I was lost in the Enchanted Forest, stomping through the snarls of black branches, snapping
    sticks and rustling the leaves, I came across a bent hag. She whispered a few words, scattered some herbs
    to the wind, and shrunk my hands into little one-inch nubs at the end of my full-grown arms.  Helpless, and
    with nightfall hastily approaching, I stumbled across a campfire that had been built by the friendly furry
    creatures of the Animal Collective.

    I could hear noises coming through the trees as I approached: They were making feral cries in the darkness,
    beginning ""Native Belle"" and startling me for just a second.  After a full day of jamborees and playing
    Indian in the woods, Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Geologist and Deaken were dancing like children around the
    crackling fire among the pines.  Their voices were twisted electronically to the point that they were
    hardly distinguishable, swirling around as though just loosed from the Ark.  I felt feeble in my attempt
    to join in, my hands cursed as they were, but the Animal Collective made me comfortable in my new body,
    showing me that even with such undersized tools-- and scarcely more than drums, voices, effect-laden
    guitars and keyboards-- infinite sounds were possible.

    The moves were simple, really: I could still whoop like an injun, flapping my nubs over my mouth to bawl
    rhythmically.  Holding my hands up into my ears, all the sounds flickered like primitive wah-wah pedals
    along a cave wall.  Even with these hands, I could still clap, and did so right in the middle of the
    Gibby-tronic slurs and screams of ""Hey Light"".  The wolf-howled bursts quieted into snapping pattycakes
    and chanted rounds around the dying embers.  These communal murmurs were far removed from their first
    spastic sounds.  Panda Bear showed that by tightening my hands into balled fists, my very arms could
    become drumsticks, conveying endless energy, every surface a percussive experiment.  Even as I tap out
    this recollection, they clack against the keys rhythmically, moving with the rounds of distorted campfire
    singing; not as a regular beat, but as something stumbled upon and followed into the wild.

    The thinly veiled vocal menace of Sonic Youth's Bad Moon Rising is laid out on ""Infant Dressing
    Table"" with much clanking, wailing and gurgled regurgitation.  Seemingly innocent as a newborn babe, ""Two
    Sails on a Sound"" mutates the dark forest into the wood panels of Whitley Strieber's downstairs den,
    suggesting the presence of silvery aliens.  As a piano sampled from Cluster II plinks out ""The
    Battle Hymn of the Republic"", the twelve-minute abduction transcends glory-glory hallelujah altogether.
    ""Slippi"" is a lost Missa Luba ritual disguised as basement hardcore, an ecclesiastical outburst of joyfully
    chanted heart patters.  ""Too Soon"" creaks as near to the ground as cricket tremors, interrupted by the
    shrapnel of the exploding frogs that fall from the trees.  Our hands also tremble with inevitable release.
    It is a natural death for such forest-dwelling creatures as us, slowly losing hold, rising and falling.

    The odd pop traces from Avey Tare and Panda Bear's much-beloved Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've
    Vanished have become discernable at certain moments on this day, but only echoed distantly in the
    woods, not so much lost as Gone.  The music was stripped down to that ecstatic skin of mouth, hands, and
    feet, invoking a rhythmic rapture I had previously only associated with Boredoms and certain tribal
    recordings.  While it's hard to grasp exactly what the Animal Collective was up to here that day in the
    forest, I have fumbled for hours tonight with my withered paws to gain some kind of understanding, and
    to hope for just one more glimpse of the ghosts with whom I was so sure I'd danced."
9227	12786	"To some secular types, the most interesting thing about faith is watching someone lose it. When you waver from an ironic disbelief in religion to a stricken doubt in yourself, you've got yourself a great arc. Or as Deleted Scenes put it, more off-handedly, ""Got god, got boring/ Lost god, stayed boring, got drunk."" Birdseed Shirt  isn't a record specifically about faith, but they work the theme hard. It carries through as they swing from grizzled jokes to unabashed emo bellows. The disgusted drunken Catholic schoolboy waltz of ""Deacons"" sits easily with the upbeat vibes of ""City That Never Wakes Up"". And the country humility of ""One Long Country Song"" still can't quite take a heartbreak lying down.The band's boast that they're influenced by both the Danielson Famile and Talking Heads holds water, not least because frontman Dan Scheuerman has the range and power to give direction to their genre wanderings. He can carry two vocal modes-- modest, country and a little bit strange, and brave and ferocious; he saves the latter approach for special occasions, always making it pay off.The songwriting is strong throughout the set, and even the short songs aren't slight. With Matt Dowling primarily on bass, Chris Scheffey on guitar, and Brian Hospital on drums, the band is a well-worn quartet that takes risks in the arrangements but never gets clever for the sake of it. They do big indie rock, like the build-up to the horns and harmony vocals that punctuate the opener, ""Turn to Sand"". The singalong and warm guitars of ""Take My Life"" make the deeply emo evocation of suicide surprisingly palatable. But they also picked up the best scraps from post-rock, including the vibes on ""Deacons"" and ""City That Never Wakes Up"", or the organ on ""Fake IDs"", a descendent of Radiohead's ""Let Down"" and the album's must-hear cut.Credit to producer L. Skell, Birdseed Shirt  isn't a knock-down-the-walls powerhouse, so much as a well-balanced demonstration of all the band's best sides-- from thoughtful existentialism to friendly irony to strange, drowsy downers. The finale, ""Get Your Shit Together for the Holidays"", encapsulates its spirit: warm and familiar at the outset, sliding into a massive, deliciously echoey climax, with dark lyrics that end on redemption-- except redemption basically means telling the protagonist to get off his or her ass and do the right thing for a couple of days. This is a young band, but they already know that good cheer will only last you so long."
538	22180	After celebrating his 29th birthday with a set at the Pitchfork Festival in Chicago, hometown hero Jeremih hinted at some new music, which arrived last Wednesday in the form of Late Nights: Europe. Jeremih Felton has been rather bounteous in recent times, adding this mixtape to his discography just a few months after Late Nights: the Album dropped in December 2015. The latter project was his third bonafide studio effort, for those who observe the distinction strictly, trailing 2010’s All About You by five years. Europe materialized at light speed by comparison. Reportedly recorded in two weeks, it’s a polished, 14-track libertine manifesto. Following 2012’s Late Nights with Jeremih and the Album, Europe wraps up a trilogy of odes to the grown and sexy.The tape’s title indicates a concept, insofar as our protagonist still thrives in the hours after the after party. Rather than a sudden desire to sing over French touch beats, the Europe of it all denotes location—recording sessions took place during the overseas stops of his summer tour. Even then the application is loose, as opener “Dubai” proves that he’s limited by neither geography nor genre. With assists from K Camp and Wiz Khalifa, the trio rides on trap-inspired drum patterns laced with a twinkling piano riff, and we get reacquainted with Rapping Jeremih.This braggart alter ego shows up again on “Lebanon,” “Amsterdam” and “Oslo, Norway,” flexing with a morning-after rasp in his voice, worn and torn during wild nights on stage and in pursuit of overwhelming women. The production, courtesy of Soundz on all but two songs, provides the perfect backdrop for him to hone his delivery, which is at times reminiscent of the drawling, yelping flow that’s currently in style. Think more Atlanta, less Brandenburg, although track three “Berlin (She Wit It)” is noteworthy for an irresistibly simple refrain that you can find yourself mumbling at random moments during the day.Unsurprisingly, the best songs are the ones that showcase Singing Jeremih and his velvety voice. “Czech Republic,” a love song with a soft-core slant, is the standout track for that reason. There must be something in the Nordic air: because two of the tape’s winners are “Copenhagen” and the raunchier “Stockholm.” Pillow talk is present throughout but “Paris (Who Taught You)” is essentially sonic porn, thanks to Ty Dolla $ign.Their collaborations are studies in lewd one-upmanship, with Ty Dolla $ign usually winning. But that’s a huge part of Dolla’s brand, an arguably more knowable one than Jeremih’s. Notoriety in post-Internet pop culture comes from either persistent productivity, or commitment to a level of visibility that generates interest—even in the absence of creative output. Jeremih’s approach lies somewhere in between these two modi operandi.He’s constant, if not necessarily prolific, while revealing very little of himself via today’s most social media channels. You recognize him from the hook of that one song, and he has independently parlayed his immense talent into platinum-selling triumphs, but he still remains something of an enigma. Jeremih almost never releases videos to accompany his singles, and through your mind’s eye it’s hard to picture his face without sunglasses on—like a less rambunctious Lil’ Jon. On “British Headboardz,” a hazy slow jam complete with bed squeaks that would make Trillville blush, his ideal companion is one who knows that there’s no “a” in his name.This harks back to 2009’s “Birthday Sex,” Jeremih’s cheeky breakthrough single that was popular long before everyone learned how to pronounce his name properly. His sound has evolved a lot since then, perhaps as a conscious effort to rebrand away from that single, but undoubtedly because of the lifestyle change that followed its chart success. If the Album was the realization of his new sound, Europe was his chance to experiment with it away from the label pressures that hounded his previous release.It’s rare to go through trials without error—the juke-riffing “Belgium (Get Down)” ends up sounding like a reference track in context. But the fault for any missteps on Europe lies for the most part with the tape’s supporting players. Verses from the Game and Krept & Konan are superfluous, although the dancehall-tinged “London” is all the better for a coquettish appearance by Stefflon Don. Fame has taken Jeremih to many different places this summer, and his openness to creative inspiration in far-flung cities has paid off. If this is what he came up with in a fortnight, running on what couldn’t have been much sleep, the wait for what he does next should be worth it.
10533	11145	"
    Samamidon (or Sam Amidon, as he sometimes bills himself)
    hails from Vermont and is the scion of
    a musical family with roots in Appalachia. A contributor
    to such indie projects as Doveman and Stars Like Fleas, he recorded five albums
    with his band Assembly before releasing a debut solo album of traditional Irish
    tunes performed on solo fiddle. A second full-length, But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted, out last year on Plug
    Research, might be called his first ""proper"" release, if only because it was
    the first with a marketing push and a wide availability. Even so, it didn't
    move too far from what came before: old folk songs translated to new, modern
    contexts. And a Tears for Fears cover.
    Amidon's new album, the ominously titled All Is Well (very little is ever well in
    these songs), again includes new readings of public domain compositions, and
    yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to Amidon's more relaxed
    approach and the contributions of composer Nico Muhly, himself a Vermonter.
    Where Chicken was well-meaning but
    occasionally dry, the trio of artists responsible for the record-- Amidon,
    Muhly, and Icelandic producer Valgeir Sigurðsson (All Is Well was recorded at Sigurðsson's Greenhouse Studios in
    Reykjavik and released on his Bedroom Community label)-- create a very specific
    space with these arrangements, which goes beyond simply setting mood and
    atmosphere. These songs inhabit their own world, closed off from the rest of
    humanity. Eschewing the hammy theatrics of indie folkies like Langhorne Slim
    and Two Gallants, All Is Well is an
    exceedingly private album, designed to usher you in and shut out everything
    else around you. It's a headphones album, but not one that relies on studio
    effects to maintain your interest.
    It helps that these songs typically traffic in internal
    monologues with a first-person narrator. In ""Saro"" Amidon sings the part of an immigrant
    from an unnamed country who describes the vast land around him and takes both grief
    and solace in missing his true love back home. Later, the singer inhabits the
    title character of ""Prodigal Son"", matter-of-factly recounting his fateful
    homecoming. Amidon sells these sentiments with a soft croak, not unpretty but
    also not expected. Despite his lifelong training, he manages to sound untrained--
    a regular soul comforting himself with music before confronting a bleak world
    again. His voice breaks evocatively when he hits the high notes on Dock Boggs'
    ""Sugar Baby"", conveying the continual ache of a lost loved one: ""I'll rock the
    cradle when you're gone,"" Amidon sings, as if mustering the stoicism needed to
    face the next day.

    Muhly's arrangements prove decidedly more modern, drawing
    inspiration from the repetitions of Philip Glass, the drones of Max Richter,
    and the flutteriness of Sufjan Stevens. ""Little Johnny Brown"", a folk tune popularized
    by Ella Jenkins in the 1960s, percolates with ambient noise-- fragments of piano,
    pots and pans percussion, unidentified thumps-- that coalesces into a calamitous
    drone. Surprisingly, it works. Throughout All
    Is Well, Amidon, Muhly, and Sigurðsson slow these songs considerably, but the
    curious instrumentation ensures they never lose momentum. Banjo and spoons
    generate tension on ""Fall on My Knees"" as a lone fiddle swirls in the
    background, and ""Wild Bill Jones"" and ""O Death"" are anchored by mournful horn fanfares
    and sustained piano notes that fade in and out between Amidon's vocals.

All Is Well is
    sequenced so that the uptempo tunes crowd the album's middle section, offsetting
    the gravity of what comes before and will come afterwards with a pair of
    celebratory songs. Flickering woodwinds and heavy strings add a sense of
    theatrical expectancy to the relatively spry ""Wedding Dress"" and ""Little
    Satchel"", which complement each other nicely and give a hopeful spin to an
    otherwise grave album. Occasionally, Muhly's score sounds too busy for such
    modest songs, but mostly the instruments interact so closely with Amidon's
    understated vocals that the arrangement and the performance become
    indistinguishable. This quality makes All
    Is Well a very forward-thinking album, despite its reliance on traditional
    tunes. With his team of musicians working so closely together, Amidon doesn't
    just update the old world to the new, but finds the roots of the new world in
    the old.

7887	14185	"Eugene Hutz, tireless rabble-rousing frontman for gypsy-punk iconoclasts Gogol Bordello, has traveled great literal and spiritual distances to be where he is today. A teenage Hutz immigrated to the United States as a political refugee in the early 1990s at the conclusion of an arduous journey begun in his native Ukraine. Assembling his band in New York City in 1999, he's spent over two decades pouring passion and sweat into establishing Gogol Bordello as one of America's most chaotically enthralling live acts and relentlessly ebullient recording artists.Hutz's odyssey has been so dogged and so deeply felt that it has become the great subject of his art itself. Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's fifth studio album, the aptly titled Trans-Continental Hustle, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against immigrants and America's tacit favoring of bland one-world homogenization in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like ""Break the Spell"", ""Raise the Knowledge"", and ""Rebellious Love"" Hutz seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder Madonna's a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between himself and his artistic creations.In the past, Hutz has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of soul-searching. That changes somewhat with Trans-Continental Hustle, as Gogol Bordello work with famed producer Rick Rubin, who ostensibly is largely responsible for a newfound emphasis on nuance and dynamics, in contrast to the always-in-fifth-gear MO that has defined the band. Results are mixed-- ""Sun Is on My Side"" offers lovely accordion and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo ""Uma Menina Uma Cigana"" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of ""When Universes Collide"" actually undermines Hutz's harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics.Hutz's emboldening exhortations and the band's sweatily democratic live show make it clear that Gogol Bordello wish to foster a massive brotherhood of open-hearted partiers. Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for Hutz and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths. I may only want to join his raucous shindig every now and again, but its nice knowing he's always somewhere tearing the roof off."
8659	13414	"For an artist who led off his debut album with a track titled ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"", Zomby has a sly academic bent to him.  Because imposing a constraint-- Zomby meticulously crafts his music with famously difficult old Atari and AKAI machines-- is a composer's trick, however lowbrow, not an anonymous-dubstep-rave-freak's trick. New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is Zomby's second stab at non-single formats, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked Where Were U in 92? More put-together than a throwaway work but lacking any true coherence or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a weird limbo.Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons the blank-eyed vocal samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (""Need Ur Lovin'"", ""B With Me"", etc.) feel. One Foot instead relies on Zomby's harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, kaleidoscopic melodies that, yes, sound not unlike those of a video game.This becomes a distraction early on One Foot, as ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead's Revenge"", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, serpentine programs against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a mother spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of creepy motion but very little definition.Because Zomby favors brief, bright tracks (together, ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar ""Mescaline Cola""-- as two-dimensional showpieces, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. ""Godzilla"" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing a stuttering beat and orbital melodies. ""Expert Tuition"" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that Zomby stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of ""Firefly Finale"" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. ""Polka Dot"" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floor-sugar. ""Bubble Bubble"" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, ""one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""-- perhaps Zomby is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: ""Polka Dots"" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). Zomby rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one."
3019	19423	In pop music, 82 seconds can be an eternity. That’s how long Primal Scream’s “Velocity Girl” lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized an entire era and established an undying narrative. As the opening track of C86—a 22-song cassette compilation of British indie bands released by the legendary music magazine NME in 1986—“Velocity Girl” has become iconic. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream’s frontman, Bobby Gillespie, left his post as the drummer of the Jesus and Mary Chain. Disentangled from that band's major-label whirlwind, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce the pop song to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.“Velocity Girl” sounded humble, but it was not without ambition. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song’s desperate refrain: “Leave me alone,” Gillespie pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring punk rock as filtered through the Byrds, and its expression of angry introversion— told in an almost Morrissey-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, sensitive young woman— was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album Screamadelica would all but eclipse their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for Gillespie, “Velocity Girl” became C86’s signature song, and it’s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn C86 from a comp into a genre.After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for indie-pop—and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from My Bloody Valentine to Belle and Sebastian to the Strokes—C86 is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its original curators, former NME writer Neil Taylor, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, C86 & All That:Indie 1983-86). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that Taylor claims should have been contenders to be on C86 in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it’s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of C86 has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.Two words pop up most often in discussions about C86—“jangle” and “twee”—and although those who make those associations aren’t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on C86’s ancestor, 1981’s C81 compilation—which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of Josef K, Orange Juice, and Aztec Camera, three alumni of Glasgow’s Postcard Records—the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. The Pastels, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the C86 torch, crawl along forlornly with “Breaking Lines,” while Miaow—who recorded for Factory Records and were led by NME writer Cath Carroll, later immortalized by her unabashed fans in Unrest—brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. McCarthy, featuring future Stereolab mastermind Tim Gane on guitar, waltzes wistfully with “Celestial City”. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-Teenage Fanclub Norman Blake), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial “E102”; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album C86. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.While some stereotypes affiliated with C86 have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors—but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from Buzzcocks’ “Love You More”, and their track that appears here, “Sad Kaleidoscope”, is an unabashed homage to Pete Shelley’s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don’t get mentioned often as an influence on the C86 school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere—from Pop Will Eat Itself’s buzzing “Mesmerized” (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman Clint Mansell scored Darren Aronofsky films) to Talulah Gosh’s lo-fi, pop-punk romp “I Told You So” (made before sugar-spiked singer Amelia Fletcher formed the more refined Heavenly). The Wedding Present fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original C86 tracklist, “This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)”, demonstrated just how much mastermind David Gedge seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, Smiths-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.The line between C86’s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group’s song featured here, “Inside”, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine’s Isn’t Anything by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of C86). But 14 Iced Bears aren’t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: “Go Ahead, Cry” by 14 Iced Bears’ Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash’s “Here It Comes” is Cure-indebted goth with a Metal Machine Music fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the 4AD roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of C86’s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of “Inside Me”,  from its 1984 debut Psychocandy. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears’ and JAMC’s tracks isn’t likely intentional, but it’s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion—of masking one’s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, pseudo-psychedelic treble—is raised, and loudly.Every precious stereotype associated with C86, however, is blown out of the water by the box set’s avant-garde contingent. Big Flame’s “New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)” is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of Minutemen’s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits bona fide musical virtuosity on “Buffalo”, even if it’s bent toward a Carl-Stalling-meets-Captain Beefheart cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of C86’s most singular, brilliant moments. The Nightingales—a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with the Clash for their legendary White Riot Tour— feed wobbly folk into post-punk on “Part Time Moral England”, right around the time that their contemporaries Mekons were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros’ “Hedonist Hat”, a clanging, churning, art-rock spasm that draws reverently from Brian Eno’s 1977 album Before and After Science. Partly in defense of these perpetual C86 outliers—the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous —The Guardian recently a piece titled “C86: The myths about the NME’s indie cassette debunked”. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.As eclectic as C86 is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire British indie scene circa 1986. As Taylor recounts in his liner notes, “The aim […] was to take an aural snapshot of the moment. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was C86 intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not”. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed—like the June Brides, one of the major players in the admittedly loose-knit scene that C86 gathered together. That’s been rectified by the reissue, with the June Brides’ horn-punched, Burt Bacharach-like gem “Just the Same” serving as the first song on the box set’s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place— such as Happy Mondays, whose undercooked “Freaky Dancin’” is a minor skirmish of the dancefloor havoc they’d go on to wreak— serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.Hindsight has been more than kind to C86, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In Marc Spitz’s new book Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film, Sarah Records cofounder Matt Haynes maintains that, “Even by the time it was released, C86 was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at NME] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as a landmark moment, but… I think that’s a slight rewriting of history.” Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator—and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by Taylor, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either his liner notes or his choice of bonus material. This reissue triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention—the dissonance and paradox—at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain.
11866	2408	"""Anyone is pretty when she smiles; me, I'm only pretty when I cry,"" sings
    Julie Doiron on her new album.  And I'll be damned if you don't just want to
    hold her, and maybe spend the whole day curled up under a blanket with her,
    staring out the window at the grey Canadian winter.  A solid dose of comforting,
    resolute melancholy can be good for the soul sometimes, and despite being the
    most upbeat album of Doiron's musical oeuvre (thanks in part to having a real
    backing band this time out), Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars still
    delivers the 100% RDA.

    Like Bettie Serveert's Carol van Dijk without the sunny smiles, Beth Orton
    without the reverb chamber and the Chemical Brothers connection, or Jenny
    Toomey on Xanax, Doiron has a natural ache in her voice that manages to
    sidestep both wistful whimsy and wretched despair. Her previous solo work
    seemed to be a bit too stark and four-tracky to distinguish itself from the
    rest of the already-saturated mope-rock market; here, she teams up with
    fellow Canadians the Wooden Stars to create a much warmer, more fully
    developed sound which supports her vocal timbre a bit better. There are
    still plenty of beautiful downbeat moments, like ""The Longest Winter""
    (""Not even the prank calls/ Are helping pass the time anymore"") or ""Seven.""
    But it's also surprisingly pleasant to hear Doiron fit herself into slightly
    different clothes, such as on the perky, almost Cardigans-like ""Dance Music""
    and the stiff, insistent bounce of ""The Best Thing for Me.""

    Although eleven songs and 42 minutes long, Julie Doiron and the Wooden
    Stars still seems a bit slight. Maybe it's because it's a rather easy,
    effortless listen, albeit something you'd only put in your stereo once in a
    while. But like hot chocolate on a cold night, it has its proper time and
    place."
14588	3121	"Led by Godspeed You Black Emperor! guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig, Fly Pan Am are but one of many storefront
    operations spun off from that multi-limbed Montreal-based behemoth.  And, as has been the case with other
    branch offices like Set Fire to Flames, Do Make Say Think, or A Silver Mt. Zion, Fly Pan Am have experienced
    some difficulty establishing an identity distinct from their parent organization.  Due primarily to Tellier-Craig's
    instantly recognizable playing style, the angular instrumental art-funk that predominated the group's first
    two albums too often resembled a pared-back, less engaging GYBE!
    But that all changes dramatically on N'Ecoutez Pas (which, unless my pidgin French has failed me,
    translates to ""Don't Listen"".)  Here, on their third full-length, Fly Pan Am complete a Black Dice-caliber
    personality shift, abandoning all previous formulae and pushing their sound outward in all directions.  For
    the first time, they incorporate vocals into their attack along with an unruly array of electronics,
    keyboards, and field recordings-- all of which results in their finest and most fully realized work to
    date.
    The album is erected around the twin pillars of ""Autunt Zig-Zag"" and ""Trés Trés Retro"", two 11-minute
    showpieces that give Fly Pan Am enough elbow room to flex their suddenly considerable Krautrock-nourished
    muscles over massive hunks of terrain.  ""Zig-Zag"" is Fly Pan Am's noisiest and perhaps best piece yet,
    combining layers of hissing electronics with a wriggling edifice of distorted guitar worthy of My Bloody
    Valentine, all while garbled voices whisper and conspire malevolently.  In French, no less.  Eventually, the
    fog lifts enough to reveal the charred tree stumps that pass by your railcar window as countless little
    bug-sized motors chug away ineffectually.
    ""Trés Trés Retro"" is a somewhat simpler affair, and its stuttering drums and hypnotic, loping bass hearken
    back to Fly Pan Am's 1999 debut, on which they dabbled extensively with minimalism and the beauty of repetition
    (most memorably when Tellier-Craig at one point plucked the same simple chord repeatedly for over 10 minutes).
    Here, though, the band gives the rhythm section plenty of traffic to weave through, with blinking stoplight
    keyboards and strange cut-up vocal edits constantly emerging to ensure that you don't get too mesmerized by
    that centerline.
    The shorter tracks assembled around these two epics are something of a motley bunch, though impressive in
    their scope and variety.  The handsomely dissonant opener ""Br\xFBlez Suivant, Suivante!"" brings Fly Pan Am
    about as close to conventional song structure as they've ever been, calling to mind Evol-era Sonic
    Youth.  The jagged, muttering ""Pas à Pas Step Until"" should cause Boredoms fans to crane their necks.  Less
    successful are brief electronic morsels like ""Buvez Nos Larmes de Métal"" (translation: ""Drink Our Metal
    Tears"") or the burbling, appropriately titled ""..."" which, at best, functions as a palate cleanser.
    So while N'Ecoutez Pas might not be the most consistent record you'll ever hear, at its best it finds
    Fly Pan Am approaching peaks of intensity and ragged splendor that few bands even acknowledge, let alone
    attempt to scale. Even better is that the whole thing is too damaged sounding to even remotely resemble
    GY!BE: For the first time, Fly Pan Am soar on their own wings."
1278	21328	"A trumpet riff; a louche, echoey, funk groove scoured by trails of guitar; a snatch of dialogue from The Wild Angels – ""we wanna be free – to do what we wanna do"". In February 1990, Screamadelica’s lead single ""Loaded"" made for an odd UK hit. Its sample soup might have put you in mind of tracks by DJs like Coldcut, but more laid back, and with the magpie wit replaced by studied cool.The vibe of ""Loaded"" was unusual enough. The identity of its makers was what really startled. Primal Scream had already jumped from sweet-toothed jangle-pop, which Bobby Gillespie’s reedy voice suited well, to scuzzy proto-grunge, which it really didn’t. Reviewers found the band’s second self-titled LP an awkward experience, which explains why a further lurch in direction on ""Loaded"" attracted as much mockery as delight. Great single, everyone agreed – but was it actually Primal Scream in anything but name?""Loaded"" had precedent – the warm, loping shuffle of the Stone Roses’ ""Fools’ Gold"" for one – but its status was set as much by what came after. Gillespie wasn’t the only indie bandleader to find himself a new groove, and the summer of 1990 was speckled with similar hits from the obscurest of sources: the Soup Dragons, the Beloved, the Farm. Like earlier psychedelic explosions, you might argue how much of this was down to the liberating effects of drugs and music on shy boys in bands, and how much was down to the more worldly urge to make some fast money and get on TV. The indie-dance bubble inflated, and a saucer-eyed version of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" by unknown chancers Candy Flip probably marked the exact moment it burst. Months after that, the Primal Scream LP finally came out.If welding ""dance"" and ""rock"" was all it achieved, its 18-month gestation would have hurt Screamadelica. The album might have been a mere appendix to a briefly promising scene. Fortunately, Screamadelica's power isn’t in an abstract clash of two different genres, but in the marriage of two very similar sensibilities.One is Bobby Gillespie’s. Primal Scream’s output has sometimes been dismissed as ""record collection rock"", their versatility no more than a procession of learned poses – the Byrds, rave, krautrock, post-punk. But Gillespie’s approach is less bandwagon-jumping and more a kind of aesthetic cosplay, where his fannish intensity of identification works to overcome the limitations of technique. The comedown blues of ""Damaged"" is Screamadelica’s weakest song, but Gillespie’s conviction makes it essential to the record.The other is producer Andy Weatherall’s. Weatherall, along with Terry Farley who remixed the ""Come Together"" single, was part of the Boy’s Own DJ and fanzine collective in the earliest days of London Acid House. Boy’s Own loved big, uplifting records, played any genre they fancied, and everything they did, in print or on record, was touched with a cheeky swagger. The euphoric splash of Italo house piano at the climax of ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"", Screamadelica’s most floor-ready track, is a great Weatherall moment. The meeting of these approaches – unashamed, celebratory club music and rock star fandom – is what gives Screamadelica its particular mood, half strutting with confidence, half yearning for transcendence. One result is that the record is often better when Bobby Gillespie is a presiding spirit rather than an actual singer. Compare album centrepiece ""Come Together"" with its single version, where Gillespie enacts a loved-up Ecstasy high in winsome style. The LP drops his vocals, reshapes the track around the gospel backing singers, and it becomes something titanic. It’s a full-length manifesto not just for the brotherhood of clubbing but for the syncretic approach to rock Primal Scream were exploring. ""All those are just labels"", thunders a sampled Reverend Jesse Jackson, ""We know that music is music."" If you want to know how joyful – and how corny – pop’s discovery of rave could feel in 1991, this is where to start.Other high points use the frontman better. ""Higher Than The Sun"" casts Gillespie as an astral voyager in a post-rave take on Tim Buckley’s ""Starsailor"". He sounds as awed by its soundscape of hoots, harpsichords, ambient drift and trumpet blasts as the listener. 13th Floor Elevators cover ""Slip Inside This House"" is just as questing, but more earthy and urgent, with a ragged-voiced Gillespie pushed beyond his limits by the groove.Screamadelica is a limit-breaking exercise in general, exploring a central question: what is ‘a band’ in the remix age? One reason the LP remains a classic is that its answer to this is so bold and open-ended – ‘Primal Scream’ here is anything from a rock group having the time of their lives on ""Movin’ On Up"", to a vaporous but definite presence on ""Higher Than The Sun (A Dub Symphony In Two Parts)"". The scoffers’ question about ""Loaded"" – is this really Primal Scream? – is firmly answered: it is if it feels that way.The fact that Primal Scream, and others, quickly retreated from this answer doesn’t make it less true. But even by 1992’s Dixie-Narco EP – included on this reissue - the band were downplaying the clubbing influence in favour of something more rootsy, recording new tracks in Memphis. Ultimately, the group’s own preference for being a rock’n’roll touring unit – with associated debauchery – stopped them pushing harder on the doors Screamadelica unlocked.The two bonus discs fall either side of the tightrope they were walking – a collection of mixes, and a document of the group’s 1992 touring set. The former, like most mix collections, isn’t meant for linear listening, but assorted nearly-there versions of ""Loaded"" show a great idea coming together and the 12"" of ""Higher Than The Sun"" is a glorious re-immersion in the song’s sensory otherworld.The live disc finds a ramshackle group admirably committed to showing their audience a great time, twisting Screamadelica’s grooves into more band-friendly shapes in the process. Some of them suffer – the segue from ""Higher Than The Sun"" into a clodhopping fragment of Sly Stone’s ""Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" is an excruciating flip from Gillespie’s finest impulses into his worst. But at best, like on the vocal version of ""Come Together"", the tracks wear their extra muscle well. And even if it closes down half of what made Screamadelica special – its reinvention of band as aesthetic – it pulls focus onto the other half. The record is in places ambitious, cosmic, showily wasted – but the thing it is most is a great party album. ""Loaded"", ""Movin’ On Up"", ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"" are still immense dance-rock singles, and Screamadelica is one of alternative music’s great periodic rediscoveries of rhythm. Dance music threw open new wardrobes for British indie – and an inveterate dresser-up like Bobby Gillespie could, and did, take full advantage."
4284	18028	"In the electronica landscape of the 1990s, Daft Punk first came over as a novelty. Funny band name, funny sound, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk”, found on their debut album, Homework. They’ve come a long way since, but the playfulness remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every new step in their career, whether positive (the landmark Discovery, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert Human After All, their forgettable score for Tron), or somewhere in between (the film Electroma) has been met initially with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”Random Access Memories, the fourth proper studio album from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, continues the trend. But the differences between their first three albums and this one are vast. RAM finds them leaving behind the highly influential, riff-heavy EDM they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. So we get a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For RAM, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost completely avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an album-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.Daft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music”. The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of Nile Rodgers followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, RAM is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s Aja and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity.Another way is to work with artists young and old who have inspired them. Rodgers pops up again on “Lose Yourself to Dance” and “Get Lucky”, and on both songs he’s joined by Pharrell on lead vocals. These two songs basically find Daft Punk attempting to make their version of a Chic song, which, in itself, is not a particularly notable goal. But the French duo’s craftsmanship carries the day. Pharrell, despite being the biggest contemporary star on the album, sounds anonymous-- his vocals are pretty much just functional. But even that is arguably in line with Daft Punk’s reverence. Disco, after all, was often a producer’s medium, and lead singers weren’t necessarily meant to be the the focus of attention. So it comes back to songwriting and production: How strong is the groove, how memorable are the hooks? “Get Lucky”, a deserved hit, works on both counts. “Lose Yourself to Dance”, on the other hand, is OK, but plodding, perhaps the weakest song on the record and a good example of the potential pitfalls of Daft Punk’s backward-looking approach.Other songs in the record’s first half-- “The Game of Love”, “Within”, and “Instant Crush”-- don’t make a huge impression initially but are best understood as part of a broader whole. “Game” and “Within” are downtempo, slightly jazzy robotic soul, delivered in the kind of gorgeous vocoder that Daft Punk have perfected. Musically, “Instant Crush” sounds a lot like a great song by Daft Punk’s pals Phoenix, and the processed lead vocal from the Strokes’ Julian Casablancas holds a simple tune that’s catchier than anything he or his main band have managed in a while. All three tracks function well in the context of the record, throwing the tour-de-force “Giorgio by Moroder” into sharp relief.“Giorgio” is a stunning piece of pop-prog that seems partly drawn from the groundbreaking producer’s experiments in long-form, epic disco, like his side-long version of “Knights in White Satin”. Moroder’s only contribution to the song is an interview that offers a thumbnail history of his life as a musician, one that recounts how how he heard the sequenced Moog as the future of music (see “I Feel Love”). The construction of “Giorgio by Moroder” is masterful, moving from easygoing beats to a for-the-ages, chill-inducing synth line, to orchestral crashes, to a brilliantly goofy guitar solo. It’s a fitting tribute to Moroder’s spirit and legacy.RAM’s best songs come in its second half, another clue that it’s meant to be heard in full. It builds as it goes. “Touch”, the record’s literal centerpiece, is where things start to get interesting. It’s telling that the songs featuring the two oldest and deepest influences on the record-- Moroder and Paul Williams-- are the most over-the-top.  (Williams' role in the 1974 cult film Phantom of the Paradise became an early obsession for Daft Punk.) These pocket symphonies allows the duo to take their concerns to the furthest reaches of ambition-- and good taste. “Touch” packs in a Cluster-fied spacey intro, some showtune balladry, a 4/4 disco section complete with swing music trills, and a sky-scraping choir, all in service of a basic lyrical idea: love is the answer and you’ve got to hold on. It’s strange, disorienting, and emotionally powerful, with a silliness that doesn’t undercut the deep feelings in the least. It encapsulates what makes Daft Punk such an enduring proposition: their relationship to cool. Their vulnerability comes from embracing cheese while also understanding the humor and playfulness in it, holding all these ideas in mind at once.This quality is also heard in “Fragments of Time”, featuring lead vocals by legendary house DJ Todd Edwards. The laid-back melody embodies another often disparaged musical moment: 70s singer-songwriter excess that East Coast critics liked to write off as the sound of El Lay-- the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Michael McDonald. Conveying the openness and innocence that marked pop radio as the 70s ended, “Fragments of Time” sounds something like a sequel to Discovery's “Digital Love”. Contrasting ""Digital Love"" and ""Fragments of Time"" also raises an interesting paradox: though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more “human,” the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect. To my ears, this quality isn’t necessarily to its detriment, as much of its appeal ultimately comes from its surface beauty, the sheer gorgeousness of the overall sound. But I suspect this feeling is at the root of why, judging from early reviews, some listeners were underwhelmed.The continual churn of the internet, experience tells us, favors quick connections, conveniences, ephemeral pleasures. But there are areas of culture popping up that seek to slow down, focus on details, and wallow in the kinds of media that it still takes money to create. This is the space that Daft Punk seek to occupy, which in and of itself can be seen as problematic. For those who embrace the more egalitarian approach to music production created by access to cheap tools and cheap distribution, Daft Punk’s mind-bogglingly lush record scans as elitist, possibly even dismissive of the creativity that is happening on a smaller scale.To really understand where they’re coming from here, you have to go back to the height of the album era, which was really just a blip in pop music history. Three things made it different: 1) it was the time just before MTV; 2) it was the time just before the CD; 3) it was the time just before the Walkman. All three hit around the dawn of the 80s and had a profound influence on how recorded music was experienced. MTV, in addition to foregrounding the visual presentation of artists, returned music to a singles-focused realm. The CD did its part too, making skipping ahead so easy and allowing for the listener to jump around at will. (It also made artwork less important and introduced the idea of records as “data”.) And the Walkman's convenience opened up new spaces for listening while decreasing sound quality, a trade-off that has driven the technology behind popular music consumption ever since.So RAM is best appreciated as a counter to these trends. It’s not that “all music should be this” but that “some music could be this.” By the time you make it to the album’s astonishing final stretch, it’s hard not to think that Daft Punk have succeeded at what they set out to do. The arrangements on ""Beyond"" and “Motherboard” are breathtaking, and Panda Bear, after many so-so collaborations, aces his vocal turn on “Doin’ It Right”, a terrifically uplifting bit of electro-pop.And then it ends with “Contact”: It’s the most old-school Daft Punk song here, and it’s also the only one based on a sample, pulling its main riff from a 1981 song by the Australian band the Sherbs. Daft Punk and collaborator DJ Falcon first used “Contact” in a DJ mix in 2002, and now it finds its way on an album about time and memory in 2013. You get a feeling of time collapsing with it, seeing where Daft Punk have been and where they could go. “Contact” will likely close some future live multimedia extravaganza, and people will go insane, and they will return to this album with new ears. You never know, but my guess is that people will be listening to Random Access Memories a decade hence, just like we’re still listening to Discovery now. You’ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, you’ll forget the day they announced the suits, you’ll forget the day the “Get Lucky” snippet leaked, you’ll forget every rumor, you’ll forget the “SNL” commercials. But the record will remain, something that channels the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present."
14703	2569	"Twentysome years before desperate postmillennial irony spawned electroclash, there was just electro.  At
    the dawn of the 80s, urban America was an incubator of newborn aesthetics where burgeoning new genres were
    feverishly built up and broken down night after night.  1979 had seen the infamous ""Disco Demolition""
    promotion at the White Sox's Comiskey Park; after a pile of dance records was ignited in center field,
    Chicago's rampant rock 'n' roll faithful erupted into a riot and forced a forfeit to the Tigers.  In
    Detroit, an intrepid radio DJ named Electrifying Mojo flouted conventional genre restraints five hours a
    night, backing up Prince with Kraftwerk and Parliament with Tangerine Dream, while voracious listeners
    like Derrick May and Juan Atkins were drawing the blueprints of techno.  Merely mentioning the names of
    New York's seminal clubs of the era-- CBGB, Studio 54, Paradise Garage, The Roxy-- evokes reveries of
    legendary hedonism and unbridled creativity, and their impact on current music runs deep.
    Since our collective cultural hindsight seems permanently set on a two-decade span, recent interest in the
    glory days of urban music has left few worthy artifacts undiscovered.  With Death Comet Crew, however,
    Troubleman has dusted off a priceless electro gem.  Along with bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid, DCC was
    a major part of Manhattan's early 80s downtown arts scene, brazenly fusing disco, punk, techno and hip-hop
    for dancefloor experimentalists and would-be B-boys.  Comprised of drummer/producer Stuart Argabright,
    guitarist Michael Diekmann, bassist/guitarist/keyboardist Shinichi Shimokawa, DJ High Priest, and MC/grafitti
    writer Rammellzee on occasional vocals, DCC was drawn together intermittently for shows and recording
    sessions in '83 and '84.  This is Riphop draws material from several performances and session dates
    during that period.
    The band's aggressively schizoid personality is split in more ways than one.  Originally named Arena Sex
    Death (my personal favorite), then Death Star Crew (George Lucas took exception to that one), Death Comet
    Crew arrived at a crucial intersection of styles and created a patchwork of malevolent Frankenstein funk
    that has influenced a generation of DJs and producers.  With live electronic drums and drawn-out sound
    collage sampling, they demolished the rigid breakbeat-and-loop structure that had dominated hip-hop to
    that point.  Huge, overmiked bass drums and frantic effects-laden guitar presage The Bomb Squad's dense
    wall of noize that fortified Public Enemy.  High Priest's booming, stream-of-conscious dialog samples set
    the stage for DJ Shadow's cinematic hip-hop.  A seething, experimental darkness permeates the album,
    recalling Dälek and Kid606.
    The most telling indicators of the album's old-school origins are Rammellzee's simplified delivery and a
    shoestring production feel to live tracks like the scratch pastiche of ""Amphipet"" and the new, new wave of
    ""A King Wave Passes"".  These quirks, though, are more endearing than inhibiting-- after all, this hypnotic,
    next-level shit was actually made back before Pro Tools existed, and Rammellzee's sing-song flow blows
    emotional buoyancy into this weighty effort.  MF Doom, in fact, owes a clear debt to his style, as well as
    DCC's overall dirty, ragged sound.
    Songs show up in complementary pairs: Psycho-sampling ""America"" and ""America 2"" bookend the album; ""Interior
    Street"" is sparse and skeletal while the hazy ""Exterior Street"" takes its lead from Shimokawa's rolling bass
    and keys.  ""Funky Dream Two"" and ""Funky Dream One"" both bounce along on the same comedic vocal sample, but
    ""Two"" is cavernous where ""One"" is brittle.  Even with the current gush of electro and dance-punk into the
    indiestream, DCC easily trumps !!! and Tussle if by no other virtue than they did it first-- and Nic Offer
    is no Rammellzee.
    Today, Tussle's sweaty, percussive dancehall punk is DCC's closest kin.  Stuart Argabright remixed their
    ""Don't Stop"" for an EP early last year, and I'm betting that set the wheels in motion to get this album
    compiled.  Death Comet Crew also reunited for a much-hyped gig in October 2003 at NYC's Knitting Factory,
    and are reportedly working on a new release.  There couldn't be a better time for their return-- now that
    we can hear it, their legacy is loud and clear."
16085	2949	"So The Faint have finally made it into the 90s. Let's toast; Smart Drinks are on me. Coming off like The Cure's own transition into the last decade, Mixed Up, tracks from The Faint's wildly popular 2001 record Danse Macabre get molded here into to the throbbing glowstick beats and gigantic bronze cojones of famous producers such as Junior Sanchez, Photek, and Paul ""Assembly Line"" Oakenfold.For the most part, each remix is based around the most identifiable facet of The Faint: the whiny, underdog-Simon-LeBon mewl of vocalist Todd Baechle. Conveniently, he's also the band's most annoying facet. (Oh, he's funny, and has the propensity to get naked at shows quicker than the strippers at the Blue Banana. I'm sure there's a lotta fuckin' urban disaffect gripping Omaha like a disease, but dudes! Blase 80s vox are the new emo howl: & I have grown weary of them.) However, even if your selective listening skills allow you to drown out Baechle's pukey purse-lipped coif, the actual remixes here-- with a few exceptions-- are mired in trahnce cliché, premeditated keyboard blasts, canny beats, and that ""UH UH UH"" pulsing low-end synth whir that blankets practically every cheap 90s house comp sold in the cut-out bin of yr local Fred Meyer's. It's all very inoffensive in its lightly perspiring drive, like hearing ""Pure Energy"" by the Information Society, ten times.Okay, maybe only eight times. Two tracks stand out: The Calculator's minimal version of ""Posed to Death"" neutralizes Baechle's authoritative pronunciations (wait... is this guy even British?!) with Leila Cusack's pretty vocals, all over a balloony glitch track that sounds straight from the new Prefuse 73 record. And with maybe a tiny sense of irony, Ursula 1000 turns ""Your Retro Career Melted"" into a funky, bass-driven disco track infused with cowbell and handclaps.Otherwise, each remix bleeds into the next with not-really-alarming anonymity. ""The Conductor"" is tackled by Madonna cohort Jacques Le Conti, aka the guy who remixed that critical Jack White blowjob, Electric Six's ""Danger! High Voltage!"" Paul Oakenfold does his intense, positive ""enter the matrix"" trance thing, and Tommie Sunshine mirrors that feel on ""Let the Poison Spill from Your Throat"", albeit with better beats and more subtleties. Photek gives ""Total Job"" an industrial makeover (complete with a chorus sung by an Apprentice of Satan) worthy of NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, before blending into Jagz Kooner's farting version of ""Agenda Suicide"". Mojolators, Junior Sanchez, even Medicine's operatic glitch... I think I got roofed and woke up in a desert rave.Is this record The Faint's attempt for legitimacy in the dance world? Is it an attempt to crossover into a larger audience, i.e. the vast amount of people who inexplicably relate to and purchase Oakenfold records? Is it an attempt by Astralwerks to regain that portion of the indie rock audience they lost after what seemed like a straight year of nothing but Bare Essentials comps? All that's cool w/me, but Dance Macabre Remixes doesn't even have the energy to scream ""JACK YO BODY"" like virtually every 90s house comp ever. Instead, its overarching mediocrity sends the message: ""This is preordained, socially acceptable dance music (possibly tailored for people who don't normally dance)."" And everyone knows that ""preordained"" and ""socially acceptable"" are the carpool lanes on the freeway to B O R I N G."
5433	16786	"Mike Shiflet's self-released 2010 album Llanos felt like a pinnacle. After more than a decade of noise and drone made in small editions for various labels, the Ohio-based artist combined his obsessions into one enveloping six-song set. But it turns out that Llanos was also a prelude, because in the past year Shiflet has made two albums for Type that are just as good, perhaps better. And they play like two sides of a coin: Sufferers, released last October, weaves patiently through a field of abstract sounds, and now Merciless paints a similar landscape with an even richer palette.It's also a more aggressive palette, though just a bit-- Sufferers also had its share of dense noise. But Shiflet's music is more interesting for how he pieces his sounds together than what sounds he uses. The power's more in the wall than in the bricks, so to speak. It doesn't matter much if he's doling out brutal racket or riding a rising drone. Either way, the connections between those textures, and Shiflet's knack for massaging them into tonal hybrids, form a kind of sonic narrative. Every moment is inseparable from what comes before and after.On Merciless, Shiflet's narrative sounds rather random at first. Opener ""Feeble Breaths"" emerges cautiously in shards of static, as if he's searching for a radio station in the middle of the woods, or groping in the dark to set a needle onto a record. But the track eventually coagulates into a pulsing loop, and from then on Shiflet's roller coaster stays in permanent forward motion. It gathers steam with crackling sheens, meditative oscillations, layered echoes, and an especially compelling piece called ""Exodus and Exile"" that evokes classical minimalism, film-noir score, and space-bound transmission.The best narratives are most compelling at the end, though, and Shiflet accordingly puts extra juice into the 16-minute, album-closing title track. Adding Marina Peterson's cello, C. Spencer Yeh's violin, and Jason Zeh's tape manipulations, he erects a windy, creaking drone that sounds both patient and urgent. It's a bit bombastic, but Shiflet keeps all the sounds grounded and tactile in a way that you can almost feel through the speakers. By the end, the track descends into more disparate timbres, not unlike the notes that began the album. That full-circle arc makes it tempting to call Merciless a new peak, but given Shiflet's history, it would be unwise to limit expectations of what he can do next."

    Let's face it-- when it comes to pairing two genres, sounds, or
    ideologies to create a new musical hybrid, rock long ago ran out of all
    its natural ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter"" combinations. For
    better or worse, this is how we end up with stuff like the Advantage, A Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC
    and ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"". And now, joining the
    mayonnaise-on-french-fries sweepstakes with an unholy union of
    post-hardcore and hi-NRG keyboards, is Enter Shikari.
    While it doesn't match Switched-On Bach
    for instant illogical strangeness, this upstart quartet's
    inspired decision to laminate energetic synthesizer blasts onto their
    cacophonous thrash does sound like a recipe for disaster on first
    blush. Surely one component of the combo will be made to suffer, either
    by the peppy keys rendering the metallic clatter toothless or the
    head-banging stuff turning the dance touches into brittle irony.
    Fortunately, the synth treatments on Take to the Skies
    are sufficiently superficial that there's no real threat of
    obtrusiveness on either side. The trance and rave elements-- almost
    invariably shimmery, galloping little things-- are just pronounced
    enough to lend a happy novelty to the proceedings, occasionally buoying
    the likes of ""No Sssweat"" and ""Labyrinth"" but rarely dictating the real
    pulse or tenor of a song.

    What we're left with then is a schizophrenic
    post-hardcore outfit, oscillating at expected junctures between
    unmitigated thrash and conventional rock passages. Lead singer Roughton
    ""Rou"" Reynolds transitions ably between larynx-shredding sandpaper
    yelps (plus occasional Cookie Monster growl) and cleanly plaintive
    emoting, with bassist Chris Batten also adding pristine pipes to
    fulfill the Daron Malakian role for a band that quite often evokes
    System of a Down (particularly on the anthemic ""Mothership"").

    As it is with many debuts, Take to the Skies
    reveals a band working to pin down what it does well, trying on several
    hats and seeing which ones fit. Surprisingly, many do-- songs like
    ""Sorry, You're Not a Winner"" and the single ""Anything Can Happen in the
    Next Half Hour..."" showcase a facility with riffage, while ""Jonny Sniper""
    and ""OK, Time For Plan B"" nicely proffer tuneful, searching pop-rock,
    the latter sounding downright New Romantic in spots. At the same time,
    however, many of the conventional rock moments sound, well, blandly conventional, and the utterly inconsequential comedown
    ""Today Won't Go Down in History"" suggests it'll be some time before
    Enter Shikari masters quieter, more ruminative fare.

    In order to make sure they get that time, the band will likely need to
    either refine or ditch altogether the synthesized window dressing-- in
    its current incarnation it's the kind of semi-clever gimmick that's
    practically guaranteed to grow stale if overused. Surely it'll take a
    little more than a simple formula of ""sonic blitzkrieg + cheesy keys""
    to keep the majority of Shikari's 183,900-odd MySpace buddies compelled
    for the long haul.

3420	19031	"“Delia’s gone, but I’m settling the score,” Alynda Lee Segarra sings on “The Body Electric,” the centerpiece of Hurray for the Riff Raff’s new album, Small Town Heroes. Over tense eddies of fiddle and sympathetic acoustic strums, her dry husk of a voice sounds more resigned than outraged, as she realizes she's too late to save Delia. Several decades too late, as the case may be: The Delia she’s singing about is the title character in the popular murder ballad ""Delia's Gone"", written by Dick Toops and Karl Silbersdorf and recorded by Bob Dylan, Harry Belafonte, Waylon Jennings, and multiple times by Johnny Cash. “The Body Electric” seeks to rescue Delia and so many other murder-ballad victims, offering an empathetic—and feminist—reading of an American folk tradition that lives on today in contemporary covers of “Banks of the Ohio” and “Knoxville Girl"". Murder ballads allow us to act out dark urges, using history to guard us against accusations of sociopathy or misogyny. But Segarra laments our fascination with such abject subject matter: “Shoot me down, put my body in the river,” she sings, “while the whole world sings, sings it like a song/ The whole world sings like there’s nothing going wrong.”For Segarra, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who gravitated toward Bikini Kill before discovering Woody Guthrie, the past is not a thing to be revered. Rather, it must be endlessly, aggressively interrogated. Small Town Heroes borrows liberally from old-time traditions, including Appalachian reels, Big Easy R&B, and Piedmont blues, yet these songs put a fresh and wily spin on old sounds and ideas. Segarra rewrites Jesse Fuller’s “San Francisco Bay Blues”, retitling it “The New SF Bay Blues” and changing the subject from a wronged woman to a brokedown touring van: “You’ve been a good old wagon/ You got me there in style”). “Crash on the Highway” subtly rewrites Roy Acuff’s “Wreck on the Highway”, its two-step beat evoking the boredom and frustration of backed-up traffic. These are songs about touring as rambling; instead of hitchin’ rides and jumpin’ trains, Segarra and Hurray for the Riff Raff are gigging around the country in a cramped van.Small Town Heroes may not sound like what you’d expect from a New Orleans album, yet it is anchored in that city’s sense of musical adventure. Segarra learned her trade playing in street bands and busking on corners, which has given her a broad musical vocabulary. She arranges and produces these songs as eloquently as she writes them, often using just a few instruments to convey a surprisingly full sound. “Blue Ridge Mountain” opens the album with her clawhammer banjo and what sounds like a clogger working together as a makeshift rhythm section, with Yosi Perlstein’s spry fiddle dancing around them. “No One Else” is built on a folk-rock foundation, yet it pitches and yaws on a rolling piano bassline that might have been learned from an old Fats Domino or Professor Longhair record.With Small Town Heroes, Segarra proves herself one of the most compelling stylists in a folk revival full of suspicious acts either too beholden to tradition or too uncritical to make much of it. Perhaps the biggest difference between Hurray and its peers is attitude: Segarra understands that these styles don’t need to be revived, so she’s not playing dress-up and isn’t concerned with projecting any sense of rustic authenticity. Instead, she understands that these old sounds still thrum somewhere deep in the American subconscious, even if our relation to them changes with each passing year. With the whole country as its geographical and historical backdrop, Small Town Heroes is an album about how life and music intersect. Rather than play to her record collection, however, Segarra takes the records out of their sleeves, scratches them up, and makes the old music speak to new concerns."
6160	15922	"Whimsy's tough. Too much, and you risk damning yourself to frivolity, cutesiness; too little, and you flirt with a potentially stultifying self-seriousness. Brooklyn-to-L.A. junkyard-pop duo High Places managed to keep their whimsy in check on their early EPs and stellar, spectral self-titled LP, matching Mary Pearson's swooping sing-songs to an alluring back-bedroom clang, playfully delivered but painstakingly crafted. Time and again in those early days, High Places perched themselves at the midpoint between experimental, electronic mangling and wide-eyed melodics, then proceeded to double-dutch all over it.Things took a turn toward the serious on last year's High Places vs. Mankind. Adding further wrinkles to their rippling productions while tamping down some of Pearson's vocal buoyancy, it's an intriguing-sounding record full of alluring textures and warped schoolyard chants. Next to what came before it, though, Mankind's melodies could seem soft-pedaled, its hooks wedged into tracks rather than constructed alongside them. And Pearson's oft-unaffected vocals took on a disaffection that felt a bit like detachment, that wonder in her voice oddly absent. This shift-- toward a fuller sound, but away from a lighter spirit-- continues on their third LP, Original Colors.Drawing on a spectrum-spanning array of dance music, Original Colors takes its cues from drum'n'bass, minimal techno, and trance's dalliances with pop. Easily their most danceable, production-centered record to date, Original Colors moves with a quicker pulse than anything that came before it. Pearson and Barber still favor their homespun beatmaking setup, and while there's no mistaking most of High Places' production work with that of the pros, they at times manage a pretty good duct-tape-and-popsicle-stick approximation of Roni Size & Reprazent's earthy clamor and the epic, arid trance-pop of Everything But the Girl beatmaker Ben Watt. Though dance purists will likely find Original Colors' careening too sinewy and scattered, every beat is set just so, and Barber and Pearson's anything-goes confidence lends these tracks an appealing elasticity.Though this shapeshifting sound world proves immersive enough, as a pop record on the order of their warbly, wide-eyed debut, Original Colors maintains a certain distance. Further flatlining her post-Mankind vocal delivery, Pearson deadpans her way through a good chunk of her lines in a distracted, almost drowsy manner. There are stretches where it seems as though she's left the room entirely; she's certainly singing less than ever before, and her vocals are often backgrounded or otherwise processed in a way that diminishes their potential impact. The crumbly, constantly undulating percussion seems to have edged Pearson out of the frame, and apart from a few more-than-milquetoast melodies they manage to set out front, she seems pretty content to let the beats take the lead, a task they're not always up for. The few graspable melodies she gets out front fare quite a bit better; ""Dry Lake"" is comfortingly loopy, if a tad lethargic, while the dubby, EBTG-nodding highlight ""Sonora"" finds Pearson doing a passable Tracey Thorn over its tumbling-downstairs backdrop. These two tracks see Pearson finally exiting her shell, shedding some of the timidity that seems to trail her here, and the beats-- easily Original Colors' most vibrant-- perk up to match. A few songs later, and there's that trepidation again.Original Colors opens up a bit with repeat spins, but its meek melodies never quite bubble to the surface the way you'd hope. Instead, as the beats deepen, their alien textures grow ever-weirder from prolonged exposure; they, too, lack some of the warmth of High Places' earlier work. But Original Colors' production still doesn't quite sit right next to its paucity of melody, and its sidestepping of the song in favor of the sound never feels like a fair trade. The beguiling interplay between the two halves of High Places-- the ethereal, almost cherubic vocals and the clattering racket in, around, and behind them-- is lacking here, along with much of their clubhousey sense of adventure. For a group who traded so well in whimsy, who got off to such a kaleidoscopic start, Original Colors can feel unusually drab."
13615	6579	"The production team-cum-recording artists in Detroit's Platinum Pied
    Pipers face commercial disadvantages. Record buyers often prefer the face on
    the cover to the voice behind the mic, and who can blame 'em. Shit
    gets confusing, like when the Neptunes became N.E.R.D. and they were a
    band but they weren't a band and...? Waajeed's
    Slum Village roots may help, but, frankly, Triple P probably won't
    make good on the Pipers' metal-promising moniker.
Presents...-style collections do have a leg up on their emcee-sponsored
    counterparts: stylistic coherence. (Hey, I care.) Triple P is no
    different. Each track is piloted by a gigantic, rushing thump. Sounds
    unremarkable, but continuity of beat is the first commandment of
    hip-hop production, and the hood is overrun by damn sinners. On top of
    this generous featherbed, PPP dump heaps of gooey, lounged-out
    instrumentation. One track has, like, eight electric pianos. Three
    more have seven. But ""Your Day Is Done"", which only brings five, is
    the no-brainer standout. The beat, to which Georgia lends serviceable
    belting and rapping, is definitive Detroit rushed snare, both smooth
    and skittish.

    Yet for all the pleasant pastichery, many tracks get a strike for
    mediocre, half-assed, or annoying vocal performances. PPP are
    immodestly generous, doling out feature spots like it's their duty to
    God. When those spots are occupied by established talent, like Jay
    Dee, the results can be exhilarating. But most of the album's guests
    are yet-to-blow newbies, most of whom sound timorous. One passerby who
    could use more trepidation is Lacks, whose performance on ""The
    Pees"" is downright obnoxious. He flows like a slap bassist, performing
    exhausting rudiments in too-tight spaces with little grace and even
    less rhythm. Not sayin' it couldn't work, but the sassy Mr. Lacks does
    not jive with the Pipers' low-laying desert bar confections.

    To PPP's credit, weak contributions from Sa-Ra Creative Partners,
    Tiombre Lockhart, and Zeno are redeemed by stellar beats. Dappled with
    streaks of astral synths, ""Deep Inside"" has a shy, backgrounded feel,
    which complements Sa-Ra's quiet, private-groovin' vox. ""I Got You""
    sounds like a civil union of Nicolay's Foreign Exchange project and
    Rich Harrison's fabulous ""1 Thing"" go-go beat: It throbs elegant
    brass and ivory under lo-fi saran, while a cacophonous ride bell tap
    dances in the back-background.

    MC Invincible's appearance on ""Detroit Winter"" sums up the
    record's shortcomings: Her skills are undeniable, but girl needs to
    speak up. So, while I'm frustrated that Triple P takes few risks and
    that its guest performers are so coweringly modest about their
    talents, Platinum Pied Pipers still get a pat on the back. And a
    motivational pep talk. And a goblet-full of sizzurp, because what the
    hell."
13143	490	"Acid House Kings' fifth LP isn't menacing, once you get past the absolutely terrifying cover. Do they have Olan Mills in Sweden? Is it haunted? The eyes just follow you. But visions of some wainscoted dystopia where bands wear turtlenecks and play acoustic Kraftwerk medleys are dispelled as ""That's How You Drive Me"" pops in like a pacifier, with all of the comfort and none of the sucking. Its gauzy lilt establishes the album's tone, an effortlessly levitating pastiche of Bacharachian flourishes and precious anorak harmonies, with the faintly lingering musk of something pulled out of mothballs.
    Major chords are accustomed to shouting, but this is how they sound when they whisper. Bandleader Johan Angergård makes sure the music doesn't get too placid to make an impression by embedding little brain-tattoos into the songs, like the giddy handclaps on ""Do What You Wanna Do"" and hipster-dork fingersnaps on ""This Heart Is a Stone"". This is a sterling example of modern twee with everything in its right place, from the flawless melodies to the droll lyrics: ""They say your middle name is trouble/ But I know it's Caroline."" Comparisons to Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura are both inevitable and unfair, since Acid House Kings predates both. Still, it doesn't help any that the rhythm guitar on ""That's How You Drive Me"" sounds exactly like a fuller version of B&S;'s ""Dog on Wheels"", or that the lead guitar on ""This Heart Is a Stone"" sounds a lot like the one on Camera Obscura's ""Before You Cry"". And how many writers have beaten me to Acid House Kings of Convenience? Whatever; that all this modern naïve-pop sounds the same is part of its appeal, although it's possible that Acid House Kings is a little more calculating than it would appear.
    Wearing their hearts on the tongues in their cheeks, Acid House Kings presents its achingly earnest songs with such seamless artifice that it approaches performance art. It doesn't stop with the ghastly cover; the first edition of the album comes with a bonus DVD containing three videos and a karaoke version of the album. The karaoke speaks for itself-- realize that you can't sing after all as you watch the band play ping-pong and pull shots of espresso. It's the videos that are of interest. Somewhere between Warhol and ""Laugh-In"", their stark pastels recreate a time that might have sort of existed but probably didn't, when everyone wore cardigans and comb-overs; danced stiltedly to fey pop music; read Marx for pleasure. Post-irony or the new sincerity? Either way, the surface of the presentation (like that of the songs) is smooth as glass-- watching Julia Lannerheim smile beatifically while singing about getting her heart broken on ""7 Days"" (Amy Millan fans: This song owns you), nonchalantly dancing while her bandmates ham it up behind her, is pretty unsettling. But the simplicity of the video imbues her with a sort of iconic presence, like she's every girl who ever danced to a sad song. So what, like, Plato meets the Lucksmiths? The tragic and the adorable vie for attention, which, in this genre, is just par for the course.  "
18206	684	"The Backstreet Boys. N'Sync. 98 Degrees. LFO. Some of the worst bands that have ever been
    forced upon the world. And what do they all have in common? They're good-looking Americans.
    Good-looking, dumb Americans. In such a time of need, who will free us from this prison we
    have created? Ugly British people. And, if the Bevis Frond's latest offering, Live at the
    Great American Music Hall, is any indication, judgment day is close at hand.

    Nick Saloman (aka the Bevis Frond), whose other credits include founder of Woronzow Records
    and the Ptolemaic Terrascope zine, is about as close to indie heaven as you can get--
    one-man lo-fi pop music made by an actual Englishman. (Bob Pollard can try all he wants to
    nail that fake-ass British accent, but at the end of the day he's still a drunken hick).
    Flydaddy Records' website claims that Nick Saloman has been called ""the finest electric
    guitarist working anywhere right now."" And while that statement is of the same typically
    overblown nature of most bands' press releases, I'd probably have to agree with that.  While
    Lenny Kravitz wastes his precious career spewing riffs straight out of ""Pentatonic Scales for
    Chronic Masturbators,"" Saloman constructs flowing, melodic guitar solos that rival those of
    Guided by Voices/ Gem/ Cobra Verde guitarist Doug Gillard.

    Whereas the Frond's two most recent LPs, Vavona Burr and North Circular, have
    showcased Saloman's ability to write brilliant hook-driven pop songs, Live at the Great
    American Music Hall showcases the band's bluesier side.  Sure, the material on this album
    lacks the catchiness of other Frond recordings, but Saloman's immensely talented touring band
    creates an energy and immediacy that is virtually nonexistent on studio outings.  See, Saloman
    is perfectly competent as a bassist and drummer, but the rhythm section on Live--
    consisting of Andy Ward on drums and Adrian Shaw on bass-- gives this record a more cohesive
    sound than any of the Bevis Frond's other albums.

    Which brings us back to our original topic: ugly British people. We live in a world where
    Britney Spears' left tit gets more publicity than every deserving indie act combined.  We are
    living in a world where LFO can sell millions of copies of an album that rhymes ""Hornets"" with
    ""Sonnets."" Our country is a fucking joke.  And as the great ugly British man Winston Churchill
    once said: ""We have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains,
    across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy."""
17287	3518	"Contrary to popular belief, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the
    moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk
    of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim.
    The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out
    moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through
    some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse as a string section pulsates toward some
    crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling
    part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the
    audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when.
    And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping
    the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise.
    The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited
    free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing
    horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is
    how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow
    and sneak quietly away after the deed is done.
    The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger on the quiet moments. The
    first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie
    a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation bears resemblance to John Cage's early
    chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form.
    Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While
    there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at
    times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand.
    By the time
    saxophonist Josh Allen pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the
    first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with
    the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio.  But when Matthew Goodheart and
    Garth Powell jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively),
    sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy
    avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is
    when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt.
    Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener,
    Goodheart plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for
    Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another one
    of these freakouts.
    Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of I Can Climb a Tree is quiet,
    subtle. Indeed, these occasional spurts of madness seem present mostly for contrast's
    sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration.
    Any good horror film will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build
    to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway,
    his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously
    braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side
    of the door?  These scenes serve to build suspense.  Similarly, songs like ""The
    Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the
    drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string listeners along, which
    makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward
    ""Accumulation #1"") that much more effective.
    All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing three names
    he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical.
    But not only are Goodheart, Allen and Powell all solid musicians in their own
    right, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe
    this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage
    explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of Eugene
    Chadbourne, Cecil Taylor and Mats Gustafsson; it's no wonder their music is so
    damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too
    bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose
    notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at
    the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell
    Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. Continually surprising,
    yes. But not scary in the least."
6958	15128	"On record, Georgia Anne Muldrow can come across as the spiritual and emotional heir to Nina Simone-- immersed in music with a cracked soul and a full heart, ever adventurous and pushing herself in new and occasionally bizarre directions. But the reality is a little different. Muldrow documents every moment of her career relentlessly, releasing a string of albums that have bright moments, but mostly feel incomplete. Her latest album, VWETO, is entirely instrumental, which is unfortunate. Muldrow's prime appeal is the way she tackles even the most rudderless instrumentals with her silken rasp, briefly attempting to keep a track in lockstep before faltering into spaced out bliss. It's this loss of control that makes her someone worth paying attention to, and without it, VWETO is just a somewhat enjoyable but mostly forgettable listen.There are promising moments, though. The slap bass on ""Strike"" paired with an upper register balloon squeak is hypnotic in the most blunted way possible, while album opener ""The No-No Chords"" sits dead center in California smog, relying on texture and loose, squelching bass to propel it forward. Meanwhile, ""fOnkRocker"" rolls so smoothly over its own g-funk bounce that it's insane that she doesn't attempt to at least throw a chorus in there. VWETO might flow beautifully from beginning to end, but it also rambles. Outside of those highlights, much of the album feels like it exists just to fill space. Tracks like ""fOnk Stroll"" drag on a few minutes too long and sound like she's fidgeting around in the space between the obvious influence of J Dilla's Donuts-era song sketches and a more fleshed out, modern funk.VWETO might be just another step in what is sure to be a long and storied career for Muldrow, but it's not the one that will match audience expectations. When she finally gets it completely right-- and it seems ridiculous to assume she won't, based on the glimpses of brilliance she's shown in the past-- she'll elevate Nag Champa and Bead Curtain soul into something worth paying attention to again."
16868	3930	"Christ almighty, it's the Hot Snakes!  Maybe you've heard of 'em.  Back in 2000, they released a fine,
    upstanding debut called Automatic Midnight.  Wasn't nothin' groundbreaking, but it spared no man
    caught standing in its crosshairs, filling mop-topped hipsters countrywide with bullets of mercurial death.
    It didn't concern itself with paltry academic nonsense like innovation and progression.
    Hell no!  It came for one purpose and one purpose only: to bludgeon.  And now the Snakes come again,
    slithering diligently between the feet of still-standing concertgoers, sensing the sweat of unshowered
    ankles, arching their backs, preparing to strike.  These are the snakes you fear most: the kind that bite.

    Combining the angular lashings of Drive Like Jehu with the strut and bravado of Rocket from the Crypt and
    a healthy dose of pure menace, the Snakes have assembled a sound straight from the heart of rock itself.
    You won't find them toppling the tower of convention to its very foundation, or even shaking their fists
    at it, and if this sound ever seems familiar or predictable, it's only because you've remembered
    it from your immortal soul.  (Plato, next round's on me.)  These guys capture the essential, timeless

    pours out the speakers is intimidating.  That's beauty of it.  Hot Snakes aren't putting themselves out
    there to push rock music to another plane; they're thrilled just to refine it through a series of lean,
    caustic numbers full of bared-to-the-bones malice and spite, punctuated by occasional moments of subtle,
    perceived vulnerability.

    It's clear from the get-go that there's danger lurking just beneath the surface of this music, and if given
    the chance, it'll chew you up and shit you out.  The jagged, stutter-stepping guitars of John Reis and Rick
    Froberg (RFTC frontman, ex-Drive Like Jehu, respectively) skip the ears and drill straight through the skull.
    Steve Albini would be so proud of the heavy metallic rumblings produced by Gar Wood's bass guitar, and Jason
    Kourkounis simply shreds his skins.  Together, these men create a musical backdrop that's hard as gaw-damn
    nails and not afraid to repeat itself until you understand exactly where it's coming from.

    Froberg's vocal tone is the perfect emotional center of each and every one of Suicide Invoice's
    twelve tracks.  Most of the time, he sounds like he's trying with all his might just to make it to the
    surface of the mix, like he's calling out across a vast distance.  His desperation adds essential emotional
    impact to what would otherwise seem to be quite obvious subject matter, giving it a truly convincing edge.
    And once in a while, on songs like ""Why Does It Hurt"" and ""Paperwork,"" Froberg drops the rage almost entirely,
    and all that's left for lines like ""I know your heart is in the right place/ So why does it hurt?"" is the
    sound of alienation.  It doesn't happen much, but when it does it's damn powerful, and not for a second
    undignified.

    Otherwise, tracks like ""I Hate the Kids"" (""Grab a spade, get in the dirt/ The older you get, the less you're
    worth"") and ""Paid in Cigarettes"" are callous and cruel enough to punch you in the stomach and steal your
    lunch money.  The only tropes these guys know are 'kicking ass' and 'taking names,' and the rest can go to
    hell, because Suicide Invoice is nothing but rock viscera in its most elegant simplicity.  And
    sometimes, that's all you need."
9889	12074	"""No weak men in the books at home,"" Gang of Four famously sang of popular history's subliminal, suppressing biases, and the same adage appears to hold true for the steady stream of reissues and compilations that have documented and repackaged the 1978-84 post-punk era for a new generation of indie-rock and dance-music enthusiasts. Maybe it was the sheer volume of DIY-minded acts springing up at the time that relegated London outfit the Lines to the margins of an already marginalized movement. Despite nominally sound credentials-- Miles Copeland's mentorship, a 1980 Peel Session, personnel links to Alternative TV, shared bills with the Cure and Birthday Party-- the Lines have thus far been shut out of comprehensive compilations issued by the likes of Soul Jazz Records and Rough Trade Shops, and earned nary a mention in Simon Reynolds' exhaustive post-punk tome, Rip It Up and Start Again. But there's enough evidence on Memory Span-- an 18-track overview of the band's output between 1978 and 1982-- to suggest the Lines were undeserving victims of attrition. Perhaps their first obstacle to hipster acceptance was that, unlike their contemporaries in Wire and Gang of Four, the Lines had yet to completely sever their trad-rock roots before releasing their first single. The Lines' earliest recordings serve as a reminder that, for all its no-future provocation, punk's amateur aesthetic provided refuge for artists looking to recapture a not-so-distant past-- specifically, a bygone 1967 when bands like the Kinks, the Who and Pink Floyd would let their whimsy run wild before fossilizing into arena rock. While the breathy melody of 1978 debut single ""White Night"" makes frontman Rico Conning's debt to Ray Davies' plain, the lo-fi production, rickety drum beat and askew blues riff mark the Lines as a definite product of their era, and perhaps a more contemporary one, too: in ampheta-mod rave-ups like ""Uneasy Affair"", you can hear precursors to the Arctic Monkeys' scrappy pub-punk. But short of providing Alex Turner with potential cover-song material, Memory Span really justifies its existence once the focus shifts to 1980's Cool Snap! EP, where the Lines began to absorb post-punk's angular, polyrhythmic and dub-wise qualities without corrupting their melodic fortitude-- most effectively on the brilliantly twitchy ""Background"", a psychedelicized companion piece to the Cure's ""10:15 Saturday Night"". And yet even this progression provides scant set-up for the revelation that is ""Nerve Pylon"", on which the Lines shed themselves of their lo-fi limitations and go for the Big Music, with a snowglobe-scenic atmosphere and ascendant chorus that, in an alternate reality, would be getting regular VH1 Classic heavy rotation alongside the Icicle Works' ""Whisper to a Scream (Birds Fly)"". But if ""Nerve Pylon"" finds the Lines prepping for their close-up, the fact that it never came might explain why they spent the rest of their brief career recoiling from it. As Memory Span delves into the band's final 1981-82 singles, the delicate post-punk/paisley-pop balance that defined the band's prior releases topples over into extended dub (""Part II""), disco-punk (""House of Cracks"") and proto acid-house (""Old House"") workouts that, while providing illuminating displays of the Lines' increasingly tangential trajectory, sound timid next to more adventurous avant-dub experimentalists from the era like Pigbag and 23 Skidoo. (Tellingly, Conning would go onto a career in producing and engineering for clients including Wire and Depeche Mode.) So the fact that Memory Span closes with an abrupt reversion to winsome 1978 ""White Night"" B-side ""Barbican""-- a last-call pint-raiser that points to the corrosive indie pop of the Clean-- feels less like a novel, full-circle conclusion than a necessary reassertion of where the Lines' real strengths lay."

    Y'know, most self-released albums don't even make it
    this far. Earlier this year, Brooklyn foursome Takka Takka started offering a free
    EP for download over the internet; by the end of September, dudes were playing
    for thousands at Central Park in support of full-length debut We Feel Safer
    at Night, opening for fellow unsigned word-of-blog heroes Clap Your Hands
    Say Yeah. The bands once shared a member, and both acts exemplify the way DIY
    musicians are using the web to reach their audiences. Unfortunately, a business
    model isn't an aesthetic, as anyone who ever tried to explain ""indie
    rock"" to a non-listener knows.
We Feel Safer at Night, true to its title, is a safe,
    practically suburban NYC indie record for the bum-free, post-Giuliani era.
    Singer/guitarist Gabe Levine sing/speaks like a nice brah from Friends
    doing his best Lou Reed deadpan, backed by lulling Phoenix-meets-Counting Crows
    acoustic rock (sorry, not quite the Rembrandts). ""She Works in Banking""
    uses a slick bassline and tingling soft-rock guitar suited for Fleetwood Mac's
    ""Dreams"", while ""Joshua and the Professor"" does choked-up
    goofball piano balladry in the earnest Ben Folds vein (Reinhold Messner,
    by the synths). But can they stand the sound of the Velvet
    Underground?
    Takka Takka also stick to what's safest and most widely
    palatable when it comes to lyrics. Like recent John Mayer single ""Waiting
    on the World to Change"", harmonica-laden ""Enough""
    addresses the war in Iraq from a smug, uncontroversial distance: ""The
    protest kids are protestin'/ But they forget that the movement's been dead for
    years."" The topic gets a more direct treatment on ""Living Out of
    Trouble"", this album's ""Details of the War"" for its
    Dylan-drenched slo-mo, but the track never quite departs the coziness of
    cliché; Levine suggests we can't hear the gunshots because our TVs are on too
    loud. Yeah, dudes, I've kinda had enough of the blame-American-Idol-first
    crowd.

    It's tough to actively dislike these guys, though, when
    even they seem to realize how lucky they are. With Kinks la-la-las and
    handclaps, ""They Built You Up Too Fast"" could be a comment on the
    phenomenon of hype itself. ""I'll be sure not to say your name at
    all,"" Levine pledges over more acoustic guitars, as if safeguarding a
    beloved mp3 from the cred-besmirching white-earbud masses. It's the type of
    song bands could play in sports bars or nightclubs anywhere in the country. No
    one can say for certain whether Takka Takka's self-released debut would've even
    made it to New York if the band didn't already call the city home, along with most of
    their buzzed-about peers who aren't from Austin or Los Angeles. I thought the democratization of music on the internet was supposed to increase
    geographical diversity.  Apparently, we're all from the outer boroughs.

4432	17830	"It isn't rare for classically trained musicians to cross into indie, but moving the other way is trickier. Icelandic pianist Ólafur Arnalds, a young composer of shadowy, wistful, slow-paced chamber music, is making it work. He began as a teenaged hardcore drummer with an illicit love of classical and film music. His efforts in that vein earned him a solo deal with Erased Tapes, home to likeminded artists such as Peter Broderick. Touring with Sigur Rós raised his public profile, and in recent years, Ólafur has shown signs of breaking free from indie-classical limbo, securing elite commissions (a score for the great choreographer Wayne McGregor) and signing with Mercury Classics, a new classical label that lacks the prestige of Decca or Deutsche Grammophon but adjoins them via parent company Universal. He achieved all this off the conservatory track, which may account for the composer's ample immediacy and wanting complexity alike.Ólafur works in blacks and whites. His musical atmospheres might be fairly abridged with the images ""night"" and ""snow;"" his releases swing from casual song-a-day EPs to hermetic, formal LPs and back again. The established foundations are intact on For Now I am Winter: the bitterly romantic strings melting over sparsely chorded rows of simple, chiming piano intervals; the faintly dated electronic production nicked from trip-hop and IDM. The album recalls Valgeir Sigurðsson's Architecture of Loss, except with the dense harmonic storminess blown off. But you can certainly hear major label resources at work. Ólafur handles the laptop and keyboard instruments but contracts out a group of strings, winds, and brass from the Iceland Symphony Orchestra; the porcelain voice of Arnór Dan; and orchestral arrangements by Nico Muhly, who reasonably responds to Ólafur’s material with dramatic yet musically cautious accompaniment.If you crave morose, impressive beauty, it's here. But for a statement on a new classical label, this sounds a lot like a stirring score in search of its ballet or film. There is startlingly little virtuosity written in the compositions, especially in the piano, where it can be hard to distinguish minimalist profundity from undeveloped themes. The strings and winds are more mobile, but Ólafur still keeps his players working through routine harmonic progressions at a pace so stately it's almost robotic. The biggest change here is the addition of Arnór Dan's vocals on four songs, which like the music are beautiful and pristine to a numbing degree, at least in this low-contrast context. Making his first appearance over a glacial piano and shimmering pads, he sounds like Antony Hegarty evacuated of wildness and swing-- though he does free up as the arrangement flourishes. He turns in some terrific ornaments halfway through ""Old Skin"", a pretty indie-pop tune that sounds like Lost in the Trees with a sultry-chaste dash of Tom Krell. He's a talented guy, and can seem to be addressing his talent more than the listener. Whereas singers you can really feel make their voices a medium something passes through, Dan's voice here is more of a carefully wrought thing unto itself-- a very fine vase on a very high shelf.  This may all sound grimmer than it is. For Now I am Winter is competent, reasonably varied, and efficiently rousing. Muhly effectuates some pleasing motion in the strings and winds. Opening track ""Sudden Throw"" is compelling, and while its intrigue fades in the driving cinematic wallpaper of ""Brim"", that darkly shining sinuousness rises again in ""Only the Winds"". ""Reclaim"" is a dashing highlight, leaving behind airless dirges and minimalist ice sculptures for a welcome dance tempo. But the lingering impression that there's not a lot to grasp emotionally becomes stark in the thinnest tracks. My takeaway from ""Words of Amber"" is that it sounds really nice to pick a winding path through piano scales in a coldly reflective room, while ""We (Too) Shall Rest"" is a funeral dirge without a subject, a feeling without a focus."
12866	11777	"To be honest, I never really thought Mclusky had much of a chance. Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of ""evil indie rock,"" Mclusky could      be best be classified as ""asshole indie rock""-- direct, obnoxious, and      unapologetic. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one awkward and probably excessive package.Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, booming drums, fuzzed      out bass, and Andy Falkous's curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      particular songs comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.A few of the better songs from the band's rough-and-tumble debut My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, Mclusky Do Dallas.      ""Whoyouknow"", ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"", ""To Hell With Good      Intentions"", and ""Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by Steve Albini's similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single ""There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"" is my favorite here, coupling a television commercial-catchy      guitar line with playful alliteration to the tune of ""hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""And then there are the other discs. Compilations like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short their own career. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      their best foot forward. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      ""C-sides""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      Mcluskyism works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice ""C-side""      like ""Colour March"" or ""Cradling"" on a mix CD, but most people will find      the condensed version of Mcluskyism to be just right. At one disc,      it's a gleeful kick in the ribs. At three, it's a      slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm."
13874	1158	"The Blue Van are more a controlled science experiment-- what happens when four zealous Danes are brought up smack dab in the middle of nowhere listening almost exclusively to Kinks, Animals, Who, and Doors records?-- than a fresh rock outfit. Their LP The Art of Rolling is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the Andy Warhol-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos.

    On The Art of Rolling, however, these guys don't simply pay homage to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade. A Hammond organ tinges every track, and singer/guitarist Steffen Westmark uses a tube amp to replicate the raw, crunchy guitar sound of early axe gods like Dave Davies. Drummer Per Jorgenson's hyperactive pounding recalls Keith Moon; crash symbols are used as hi-hats, the snare takes a serious flogging, and massive tom fills are thrown in at nearly every transition. For better or worse, the lyrics are equally dated, seldom addressing issues more dynamic than lovesickness, desperation, or down-on-your-luck blues. ""I Want You"" simultaneously steals the riff, hook, and lyric of the Kinks' ""I Need You"", and the same helpless romantic sentiment can be found in ""I Remember the Days"", ""Revelation of Love"", and ""Word From the Bird"".

    Word on the streets is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, sold-out shows in Brooklyn. Maybe so, but on record I don't buy it. Sure, most tracks start with a funky drumbeat overdubbed with shouting and laughter, but that doesn't mean a party's going on. Too many progressions are pulled straight from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot.

    To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there was music out there more intense and enthralling than The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in arrested development since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping the retro sound, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound increasingly more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?"
16277	7561	"Well, my goodness, what a transcendent little album.  First, the thing transcends its clunky name.  Then
    it transcends its ""for girls""-ness. Whuh-oh: By that I mean, well... you know what I mean.  The way
    Yoshimi was ""for girls."" And Jeff Buckley. Still good and all, just ""for girls."" That's no diss of
    lassitude-- in fact, the gender-reference is unfortunate; I was taught (by a girl! whew) that the phrase
    denotes a semi-precious, self-conscious quality, what proclaimed tuff-girls mean when they announce that
    they are dressed ""girly.""

    Compare Leo DiCaprio's eyes when he was a serious young actor with the
    twinkle-googly eyes of Titanic and the rest, in which he is ""for girls."" Think of the way Conor
    Oberst poses for pictures, or performs, or does anything except Desaparecidos. And don't act like your
    scene lacks a contingent of people barely into music, who instead relish, as is their right in this freest
    of countries, a band's ""hotness"" or ""cuteness."" At some points on this debut, Summer at Shatter Creek is
    a Jeff Mangum ""for girls,"" especially when songs bust into pageantry/fanfare with the piano-led lonesome
    cuddliness of march music deprived of its procession.

    And you know what ""F.G."" film director Summer at Shatter Creek sounds made tailor made for? Wes Anderson.
    Almost any song on Summer at Shatter Creek could slouch ethereally (however one does that) beside Elliott
    Smith and Emitt Rhodes on the soundtrack to the upcoming prequel Episode 1: Look Who's Tenenbauming.
    And dig the album cover's ornate frame of little-kid-type art: a perfect match for Anderson's fetishistic
    artifice-avalanches under which mature children and immature adults confound each other. Very ""F.G.""

    By the way, Summer at Shatter Creek is one guy: a Craig Michael Gurwich out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. And you
    know what else he transcends? That one-guy-band thing. But watch out, Gurwich, because you come very, very
    close to owing royalties to Dump, the solo project of Yo La Tengo's James McNew, whom you kind of sing like,
    but sometimes better, and produce like (when Dump is produced) and who also adorns his albums with homegrown
    ""F.G."" toddler-kitsch a notch beneath Hello Kitty. Another neverlander to whom Gurwich is similar,
    in terms of tempo, guitar tone, layered elf-vox, and fractured Beatlesiana is: Tobin Sprout.

    But Gurwich can't be stopped: He's on a rampage of transcendence! Because he also transcends that
    one-guy-band-that-sounds-like-a-huge-band thing. He's one of the best blends of lo-fi loner and Phil
    Spector aural huzzahdom I've ever heard. He's a bedroom Bacharach like Badly Drawn Boy, creating songs
    that trigger decades of pop reference points-- he's Edward Erahands.  ""The Essence of Time"" asks what
    if Pet Sounds was a more psychedelic collaboration between Skip Spence and a Jan & Dean trapped
    in the phantom zone, burning incense blended with Elephant 6 ashes. ""The Drive"" is a drumless Zombies'
    ""Time of the Season"" if it were sung by cute zombies.  In fact, much of the album suggests a otherworldly
    and eerie, but cute, Goodwill in which an otherworldly and eerie, but cute, oldies station is being played.

    Of course, some of the album's just prime indie rock, albeit on the mellow tip. The coed dreampop of ""I Don't
    Even Miss You"" conjures ""for girls"" classics by Slumberland bands Rocketship and Nord Express.  And speaking
    of slumberland, the disc tellingly thumbs it nose at Wilco and Hayden and other such indulgers by boasting
    the obligatory lullaby (""Go to Sleep"") as its fourth song. The juh-hamm of ""Home for the Holidays"" is a
    collision of squeaky-cleanery and Thom Yorke's morbid wail-- imagine a Disney sitcom called Radiohead
    Meets World.

    Still more transcendence! The album's best song (""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"") transcends both the
    ailment-song and concerned-neighbor-song subgenres, trotting on the victory lap alongside Suzanne Vega's
    ""Luka"", Dogbowl's ""Growing Up in a Wheelchair"", Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"", and sometimes Metallica's
    ""One"". This track best capitalizes on the album's ethic of transmogrification; most of the tunes burp or
    blossom into expansive second acts, but when ""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"" does it-- yeeeow.
    Gurwich goes from sounding like a detached artiste to belting out an ode to symbiotic suffering that
    reveals, via foil, the vulnerability of its speaker.

    Insipid lyrics (example: ""When someone makes you feel like you are just shit/ They are not a friend"") and
    too-long buildups keep the album from galloping into the promised pastures of Eight Point Five Plus, but
    Summer at Shatter Creek's elegant horses can practically smell that realm's hallowed poop. I predict a long
    shelflife for this record, but mang, there's so much other stuff on that shelf to choose from..."
5753	16346	"James Ferraro can talk a good (or at least entertaining) game. ""As I write this, Dr. Conrad Murray has just been indicted for the manslaughter of Michael Jackson, history's biggest pop star,"" he wrote, in an email exchange with the Quietus in 2011. ""And I wanna write a fiction inspired by these events. And I've already got the soundtrack floating in my head: MELODIES OF TENSION, SHAME, DARKNESS AND SECRECY."" In a recent interview with the Stool Pigeon, he talked up Lana Del Rey's shaky SNL appearance, calling it ""a high point in our civilization right now."" After tooling away in the noise underground for years, the modicum of exposure afforded to Ferraro via the acclaim for Far Side Virtual has given him a platform, and his calloused fingers are hammering away at his touchscreen (a bootleg Android phone, natch, as per the Quietus interview) in an attempt to maintain our digital gazes. ""VAPORS N 1 HOUR,"" he yelped on Twitter, just prior to delivering this free mixtape under his new Bodyguard moniker.This is a quickie follow-up to the similarly released Inhale C-4 $$$$$ under Ferraro's Bebetune$ name, thankfully dropping much of the hip-hop inspired material pockmarked throughout that release. Instead, we get Bodyguard, apparently the name of a band Ferraro has formed, who mostly trade in all-caps track titles with occasional hashtags and underscores thrown in (""#FLAMETHROWER"", ""Ice_Cut_Digital""). It continues Ferraro's preference for spewing digital debris all over his work, a feeling akin to piling up a dumpster with Tumblr detritus and funneling it into song. Much of it bears the same kind of off-the cuff, hit-a-preset-and-go feel of his most recent work, with sets of tinny loops curling around one another, occasionally edging toward the eight-minute mark. Silica Gel is a long-ass grind for the Ritalin-addled audience Ferraro is courting, with the combined runtime just over the one-hour mark.But at least there are a few threads of inspiration to cling onto on here, which sets it apart from the dead-zone drudgery of Inhale C-4 $$$$$. The opening ""H.U.M2.E.R."" makes it feel like this might simply be more of the same, with a Rihanna sample clumsily poking through the glitchy gunk. But that proves to be a false start to an uneven mixtape, which lacks the conceptual weight that hooked people into Far Side Virtual. Instead, this feels like a loose collection of ideas Ferraro had hanging around his hard drive. Occasionally it's pretty, on the yapping dog groove of ""E-CIG"", or in the gently oscillating pulse that lopes through ""Ice_Cut_Digital"". At other times there's a towering build of maximal fury (""#ACIDRAIN""), a limp dip into malfunctioning R&B (""RAIDEN - BLUE LIGHTS # NZT - 48""), and plenty of attempts at assimilating the feeling of staring into a cracked iPhone screen while crunching a disgarded Nintendo 3DS underfoot (""SEX TAPE"", ""BLACK AND RED"", ""BLOOD TYPE : 5 HOUR ENERGY"").It looks like Ferraro will spend a decent portion of this year with Bodyguard. Live shows and a debut album are promised for the summer. If that's the case, he would be wise to flesh out the concept a little, which is the central problem with this mixtape. After being so assured in his vision, Silica Gel is Ferraro spinning his wheels, occasionally finding flashes of inspiration, but mostly chasing his own (animated .gif) tail. In his review of Inhale C-4 $$$$$, Pitchfork's Brandon Soderberg talked about Far Side Virtual being critic-proof, partially because negative reviews could be dismissed as listeners' not getting the joke. But there's some truth in the saying that a good joke never needs explaining, and in interviews it sometimes feels like Ferraro is falling over himself in an attempt to get his point across, albeit in an entertaining and highly readable manner. Here, there doesn't even seem to be a point. Which, considering his track record, may well be the point."
352	22312	For almost a decade, Robert Glasper has been the standard-bearer for jazz music’s fusion with hip-hop, soul, and rock, turning songs like Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Radiohead’s “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” into kinetic electro-funk mashups. With his Experiment band, Glasper, vocalist/saxophonist Casey Benjamin, drummer Mark Colenburg, and bassist Derrick Hodge tend to leapfrog different genres, making music that’s rooted in jazz and R&B and impossible to peg. “My people have given the world so many styles of music,” Glasper declares at the top of ArtScience, the Experiment’s new album. “So why should I just confine myself to one? We want to explore them all.”ArtScience follows Black Radio 2, the band’s guest-heavy 2013 LP featuring rappers Common, Snoop Dogg and Lupe Fiasco, and singers Jill Scott and Norah Jones, among many others. On it and the band’s first Black Radio album, the Glasper Experiment mostly stayed in the background, giving room to their guests to shine atop the group’s instrumentals. The formula worked: Black Radio won the 2012 Grammy for Best R&B Album, and “Jesus Children”—a Stevie Wonder remake from Black Radio 2, featuring vocalist Lalah Hathaway and actor/poet Malcolm-Jamal Warner—won the 2014 Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. For ArtScience, the Experiment keeps things in-house, handling all the vocal work themselves. Glasper himself sings lead on “Thinkin Bout You” and Benjamin—the group’s de facto lead vocalist—is front and center on “Day to Day,” “Tell Me a Bedtime Story” and “Hurry Slowly.” ArtScience feels less restrained than the Black Radio series—which, after two releases and a separate remix EP—started to feel safe and redundant. So perhaps for that reason, ArtScience doesn’t play like an R&B or jazz record; it pulls in ’80s funk and ’90s soul without landing any place in particular. For the first time, we get to hear the Experiment let go for a full project, not just on a few songs here and there.A romantic tone flows through the album, using lyrics that speak to different stages of affection. “Thinkin Bout You” is a sweet ode to puppy love, a reminder that no matter the circumstance, true devotion can withstand long distance and everyday doldrums. Glasper’s voice is washed in bright synths, bolstering the song’s sentimental aura. On “You and Me,” Benjamin recalls a time when he wasn’t so trusting, when his heart was broken and “locked tight.” But in comes a new love, making everything better: “Can’t explain, what you do/How ya do, some kinda mystery.” In years past, the Experiment was more beat-driven; tracks like “Festival” and “Open Mind” emphasized the band’s great instrumental arrangements. The lyrics aren’t overly intricate, but they offer just enough nuance to let the soundtrack remain the focal point. Songs like “Find You” and “Let’s Fall In Love” strive for mainstream acceptance—the former is a hard-charging bounce beat; the latter uses an Auto-Tuned, trap-infused cadence to perhaps pull in younger fans. ArtScience is the Robert Glasper Experiment’s most realized effort, mainly because they’ve stopped relying on outside talent to get their point across. They’ve created their own vibe, one that needed their own voices to truly resonate.
15002	3981	"Texan songstress Jolie Holland regularly wrangles comparisons to the Cowboy Junkies and Gillian Welch, but
    her more formidable likeness is homestate neo-powerhouse Norah Jones: No matter how boring
    or stupidly inconsequential Jones' records may be, Jones has proven herself one of the most unexpected
    new forces in pop, forgoing the seemingly predictable pop landscape in 2002 and single-handedly exposing
    a new, painfully untapped market of cocktail-partying music-buyers.  Thus, witness the aftermath: Now,
    plucky Jolie Holland has to contend with a new, post-Jones landscape, wherein slow, salty coos have become
    alarmingly ubiquitous, and a female singing scrappy, country-tinged jazz is forever linked with a
    Borders-shopping, latte-drinking, Nantucket-summering herd of yuppies.

    Like Jones, Holland produces her own records, and plays several instruments (guitar, piano, ukulele), but
    Holland also single-handedly scribes all of her own material, injecting a healthy bit of confessionalism
    into her lyrics (see Sascha's ""I fell in love with a boy/ Who has a real life romance with a train"")
    whereas Jones' quips tend to fall embarrassingly flat, each verse impossibly lifeless and smooth.  This
    is, ultimately, where Holland exceeds most notably-- her vaguely gothic cautionary tales and lovelorn
    laments are always strikingly personal and passionately rendered, with traditional arrangements, heated
    narratives, and sprays of big Texas spark gently folded in.

    Holland's pipes are dynamic enough to suit a variety of vocal styles, and Escondida, Holland's second
    full-length (and her first not culled from demos), boldly embraces an entire handful of tried American genres,
    her voice often flitting from country-rock twang to frantic crooner scats, or brazenly hopping from sultry,
    neo-beat jazz whispers (see repeated references to ""Billy Burroughs"") to benign singer/songwriter musing.
    Leaving little room for speculation, Holland repeatedly assures us that, yes, she can sing it-- and while
    self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized,
    internally cohesive album, Holland's scope periodically makes Escondida appear non-committal and/or
    scattered.  Thus, the record occasionally becomes the sonic equivalent of playing dress-up or signing up
    for seventeen youth sports leagues-- and there are only so many hat-changes an audience can faithfully
    endure.

    But all fickleness aside, Escondida still offers a spooky, blues-driven platter of jazz-folk, with
    plenty of interesting-- if vaguely predictable-- melodic turns.  The guitars-and-cymbals-only ""Black Stars""
    is a spare and prickly incantation, while ""Goodbye California"", which sounds as though it's being sung
    by a woman with a rubber mouth, putters proudly, an epic road story.  Holland refers to standout ""Old
    Fashioned Morphine"" as a ""bastard hybrid"" of Old Time Religion and Willie Johnson's take on ""Wade in the
    Water"" (Holland also includes a hilarious-if-ridiculous cautionary blurb in the liner notes: ""I wrote this...
    in the midst of a meditation on the history of medicine.  I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to fuck up
    their life""), but it's hard to dub the slithering, layered track anything but her very own.

    Jolie Holland is well-armed to fight off detractors ready to dismiss her efforts as Jones-fallout, and
    perfectly equipped to counterattack all those currently assuming her songs are listless imitations of an
    already watery phenomenon.  And while Holland will probably never see Jones-size success, she's still
    working out her own path-- and the end looks promising. "
2341	20141	"All We Are’s debut album is, above all else, smooth. The kind of ""smooth"" that you pronounce in a way that becomes a tongue massage—smoooooooooth. But not ""smooth"" in the way people can be, synonymous with ""oily"" or ""slick,"" denoting a kind of facile charm that can make you like someone you otherwise find objectionable. In fact, it’s very difficult to ascribe any sort of personality trait to All We Are based on the available evidence. Should that matter if they’re dedicating their time to your makeout music? Seems a bit ungrateful. So All We Are is smooth in the manner of an accessory to seduction; it’s the feel of cool lotion on your back. It’s a roll around on high-thread count sheets.If you were to call All We Are ""edgeless,"" they’d likely take it as a compliment, as they pride themselves on pristine blends; their members originate from Norway, Ireland, and Brazil but met at college in Liverpool and maintain a distinct, buttoned-up Britishness. And their music serves as a kind of mixtape caulk, each song a viable transition between the distinguished names in a type of nominal ""indie rock"" which consists of bands with a rock setup playing some variation of what most would consider R&B. The pinging guitars on ""Intro""—as well as the existence of a track called ""Intro"", itself—instantly brings the xx to mind, as do the group’s cooed, co-ed vocals which equate standoffishness with sex appeal.But musically, All We Are most often hew towards the fleshier, aloe-infused bath and body works of Rhye or Wild Beasts' simmering art-funk. You might be able to spot Dan Carey’s production work on All We Are based on sound alone—the guitars are all silvered, textured like liquid mercury or glitter paint, the drums are crisp and exact. It’s the sound of live musicians meant to be sampled for club remixes. It’s all-too-common to say that music of this sort was intended for high-end boutiques (even if it was written in a Norwegian cabin), though by comparing a lover to clothing on ""I Wear You"", All We Are aren’t ducking those shots.It’s timely, though none of it sounds trendy—the instrumental chops are there, and All We Are play with earnestness. Every variation of runway indie is within their grasp: they can do a soul bump-and-grind (""Utmost Good"") and hyperventilating funk-pop (""Honey""). But All We Are haven’t found their voice yet, in either a figurative and literal sense. As musicians, All We Are can accessorize, but they also treat lyrics like socks, nonchalantly grabbing the first matching pair out of a drawer of regulars: ""There’s something about you,"" ""I need you, baby, to keep me alive,"" ""I want you, can’t get you out of my head/ I just want to do it again,"" ""Honey, you got to feel it with somebody."" It’s difficult to extract any exact feeling anyone experienced at any point; all three members contribute vocals and none generate the force that could nudge All We Are out of its indistinct mood of either vague amorousness or manageable heartbreak.All We Are makes a stylish first impression, showing up so impeccably tailored that you wonder if it secretly fears all of that fumbling human contact that could mess things up. The most compelling moments on the record occur when the trio drop that pose and function like an actual rock band. The best hooks are mostly sibilation, a couple of hooted ""oohs"" on ""I Wear You"", rapturous sighs on ""Stone"". Meanwhile, the back half of All We Are is filled with slow jams that barely stir from a post-coital heap. The album peaks twice, the exact same way—on ""Stone"" and ""Keep Me Alive"", All We Are slowly build on glistening guitars for five minutes before Guro Gikling just lets it rip, similar to Carey’s previous charges Caroline Polachek or Natasha Khan. These moments add welcome contrast, but also expose a smooth record that all too rarely recognizes its need for friction."
6941	15138	"The winsomely cute Frenchmen in Tahiti 80 have been bouncing around the international rock scene since the early 1990s, playing the kind of blithe, bouncy, and buffed-to-a-high-gloss indie pop that French bands do so well.  So they've certainly put in the work, outlasting many indie next-big-things over the last decade-plus. But they've also never achieved a hit on par with their peers in, say, Phoenix.The disparity between the band's dogged longevity and their limited success isn't hard to account for.  Like so many bands who litter used CD bins and MP3 blogs, Tahiti 80's music has always been just good enough to ensure a modest fanbase happy enough to check out an album every two years or so. They're a wannabe pop act in search of that one really great pop song, let alone a whole album full of them.Tahiti 80 have just never written a hook as strong as the ones you'll hear on ""1901"" or ""Lisztomania"", and after six albums, you wonder if they ever will. On the evidence of The Past, the Present, and the Possible, they're still searching for one of those choruses that lingers in your head all day, as much as you might like it out of there. The main problem is the songwriting, which could charitably be described as a well-executed but ultimately ignorable mix of lightweight power-pop and smooth soft-rock clichés, played as competently as possible and yet without an ounce of verve, joy, whatever.But frontman Xavier Boyer's mimsy mewl is also a stumbling block to Tahiti 80's pop ambitions. Boyer's voice has all the character and dynamism you'd expect from a second tier indie-pop band, however polished the end product. Not that Phoenix's Thomas Mars is Marvin Gaye in the pipes department, but he can honestly get across pop ecstasy, even if it's the laid-back sort. Of course when you call your second album Wallpaper For the Soul, you might as well be announcing that your ambitions don't extend much beyond making incredibly slick background music for the Adult Alternative set. Same as it ever was then on The Past, the Present, and the Possible, though as indie-as-background-music goes you could do a lot worse, especially these days.Like many French bands, Tahiti 80 mine heartbreak and hedonism equally, and while their music may sound lovesick, the overall vibe is also one of sun, sand, and good times. It's a trip-to-the-beach soundtrack, in other words, at least if the beach we're talking about is in Ibiza. Perhaps rather than a pop album, where it pales, it's better to think of The Past, the Present, and the Possible as one of those (often French) chill-out comps that were everywhere around the turn of the millennium, where it would be a stand-out. Plus compared to the glut of (mostly American) indie bands exploring a similar beachcombing sound recently, Tahiti's grasp of basic songwriting makes them sound more like pop geniuses than pop wannabes. Like most bands who list the Beach Boys as an influence, Tahiti 80 are kidding themselves if they think they've even reached a Surf's Up level of quality here, but compared to the bulk of the chillwave crew,  they're Phil Spector and Brian Wilson rolled into one."
14295	1141	"First, allow me to get this out of the way: Jesus Lizard Jesus Lizard Jesus Lizard. As enjoyable and righteously fierce as Breather Resist are, they start and end with the Jesus Lizard. Caveat listener-- if you're uncomfortable with a group proudly wearing a seminal predecessor's influence on their sleeve, then Alt-Tab yourself out of this browser window and give your (hopefully) well-worn copies of Liar and Goat and Bang another go-around. On the other hand, if you're game to hear a group gamely reinvent the Judas Cradle, then you could do worse than to give these kids a chance.

    So, yeah, it's pretty clear guitarist Evan Patterson holds Duane Denison in high regard. The way Patterson's winding, nauseous leads (cf. his careening string-bending in ""Amphetamine Praise"") slither around the shredded hoarse vocals and careen off of the stiff yet febrile rhythm section, one can't help but notice the similarities. Not that this is a bad thing-- Patterson should take pride in being able to both crunch numbers (as in the gear-shifting ""Honest to God"") and perform simple math (such as the spacious noodling introducing ""Loose Lipped Error"") with such violent grace.
Charmer takes little time to get up to speed. The introductory track, ""An Insomniac's Complexion"", opens with three quick hits, pauses for a moment atop a bed of squealing feedback, and then begins thrashing. The group can squeeze five minutes' worth of song into 120 seconds (""A Passing Glance""), stretch their hyper kinetic pummeling out to comfortably fit a six-minute frame (""Amphetamine Praise""), and switch seamlessly between pensive throbbing and full-on fury without breaking stride. (Take your pick from any of the 11 tracks; I'll stand behind the aforementioned opener.)

    Though the sturm and drang the group regularly summons doesn't fail to impress, the quieter moments sprinkled sparingly throughout-- the guitar/trumpet duet that introduces ""As Far as Goodbyes Go"", the two minutes of relative quiet at the start of ""Loose Lipped Error"" slowly ratcheting the level of tension, and the scream at the end of the CD that morphs into what sounds like a sped-up bagpipe track digitally castrated-- might be more impressive. It's easy to just hit the one note and hold it; it takes skill and confidence to try different tacts, and it's a whole different proposition to try these sorts of changes at the speeds Breather Resist achieve.

    And, lest we forget, while the band grinds their way through these taut catharses, there's vocalist Steven Sindoni riding the wave and doing his best to splay his vocal chords through volume and will. If you can actually make out any words he's screaming, then kudos to you-- it's not as if Sindoni offers any help. The few moments of vocal clarity I found were quickly subsumed and subdued. Granted, in the wake of a glorious racket such as the stuff Breather Resist concoct, it's more important to get across to the listener the unfettered aggression and fury of the music as a whole than to be implicitly understood. Breather Resist send that message out loud and clear. And I do mean loud."
2436	19908	"After two decades as a band, Primordial can be excused for taking their time to sprint. On each of their last two records, the Irish metal stalwarts lurched into motion, as though priming the engine of some great old machine. To the Nameless Dead, from 2007, reached its racing, blackened beat after a distended prelude of electric guitar haze. Four years later, Redemption at the Puritan’s Hand wove through militaristic field recordings, meandering acoustic guitar, and galloping war drums for two minutes before ripping into its melee.The time for hesitation, however, has ostensibly passed. Where Greater Men Have Fallen, the band’s excellent eighth album, begins with a very big boom. The drums open with a heavy hit, followed by a jagged-edged riff and a countering lead that’s pulled as taut as a high wire. And when frontman Alan Averill, or A.A. Nemtheanga, screams ""Go,"" the beat only intensifies, with the guitars flexing extra muscle, too. In the time it’s recently taken Primordial to get into a song, Averill—one of the most captivating bandleaders in metal—is already screaming tales of pillaging armies, buried children, and massed graves. For a band that’s always paid so much attention to the end of empires and lives, the pressure of their own creeping morality seems to have induced added urgency.Primordial have already flirted with their own demise: In 2010, after an onstage meltdown in Greece, Averill publicly apologized for the actions of drummer Simon O’Laoghaire and admitted that Primordial sought an immediate replacement. ""Over the last 10 years, we have had many problems with Simon’s alcohol and substance problems,"" he wrote. ""We have tried many, many times to help him out, but on Saturday things reached a new low."" But the quintet persevered and summarily recorded the death-conquering record Redemption.The survivor symptoms seem more prominent, however, on Where Greater Men Have Fallen, an eight-song set that finds Primordial more focused—but just as fierce—as ever. Primordial’s discography is a stylistic field trip. They have ventured between straight black metal homage and heavy metal heroics, but they have specialized in a mix of the two, laced with idyll accents, acoustic instruments, and the recognizable melodies of Celtic folk. There’s neither space nor time for that here. ""The Seed of Tyrants"" heads straight into a black metal ascent, the band easing the tension between the rhythm and riff only to pull it tight again. The song ends much where it starts, redirecting only for a brief mid-tempo midsection that serves to emphasize the ferric strength of its furious conclusion. ""Babel’s Tower"" locks quickly into a lumbering doom groove. Averill uses the pulpit to croon and cry his prophecy of the world’s end. At various points, the song jumps into double-time and half-time, but both instances swivel around the same languid riff-and-rhythm pair. Compared to Primordial’s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, Fallen feels like a compulsory listen.Late-album highlight ""Born to Night"" does make time for a long and gentle introduction, but the magnetic tune that eventually emerges bears the theatrics of Iron Maiden and the twisting maneuvers of Confessor. What’s more, every turn of Averill’s voice here feels like a plea from some hardened soul singer, begging you to follow him into his battle. That’s an essential element of Fallen’s appeal; though Averill has been one of the most capable singers in metal for two decades, he has tapped into a new potency, delivering these tales of loss in search of redemption like Mahalia Jackson looking for her Lord. It’s surprising that, a quarter-century into Primordial, Averill is now perhaps better than ever. His performance during ""Come the Flood"", for instance, is electrifying. He leaps between falsetto crests and bellowed lows during the first verse, broods and commands through the chorus, and vamps with gusto in the turnarounds like he’s the son of Robert Plant. On these eight tracks, Averill is in total control and absolutely thrilling for it. But none of this is to say that, just because Primordial omitted some acoustic accessories and upped the rock spectacles, they’ve turned away from their Irish pedigree, always such an essential part of the music they’ve made. Rather, the opening title track swivels around a chorus to which you might lift a pint in a pub, its sing-along swagger reinforced by shouted harmonies and guitars that aim upward. More important, though, is the way Averill questions his nationality, pride, and sense of belonging in these lyrics. There is an incensed resignation at work here, a feeling that Ireland is only another territory that forsook some of its own early virtues. ""This dreadful history we have sired,"" Averill offers, ""is the black, bleached future that you have desired."" That suspicion exists outside of Ireland, of course, and resonates across the Atlantic right now in particularly shameful ways. It’s the right time for Primordial to push pause on their nationalist isolation—not only for their respective age, but also for our collective one."
10961	10687	"In the age of computerized music-listening, calling an album ""too long""-- a dubious complaint even two decades ago, when CDs first made track-skipping simpler-- seems absurdly outdated. After all, it's easy enough to make an iTunes playlist of a record's best songs, right? So I don't get it when people call Devendra Banhart's albums too long. Not only is that problem easy to rectify, but his rambling style needs room to breathe, and space to wander toward its inspirations. Banhart's valleys have rarely diminished his peaks, and often provided ramps to them.
    But after spending time with the 16-track, 66-minute Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, I'm starting to understand. It's not so much that the quality varies, but that a bloated, lethargic feel permeates the record. Banhart has too much skill and creativity not to hit on something good when given 16 chances to do so. But in the context of the album, even the best pieces sag, bathed in a blurry haze that bleeds over from other songs. And it's hard to shake the feeling that the highlights would've been brighter given the extra time and attention they were deprived of by the lows.
    The easiest fix would have been for Banhart to restrict his tiresome love of genres. This cloying infatuation pops up on all of his albums, but he usually keeps it to a minimum, and often tweaks the clichés of the styles he apes. But more than one-third of Smokey consists of indistinct genre exercises. There's a flat Samba piece (""Samba Vexillographica""), a middling Reggae jaunt (""The Other Woman""), a weak Motown rip (""Lover""), and a sub-Santana Spanish rocker (""Carmencita""). Worst of all is ""Shabop Shalom"", a Jewish love song done in doo-wop style and filled with painful couplets (""When I'm ever in a foul mood/ I've gotta see you in your Talmud""). Banhart labors to distinguish these tunes with his stellar voice, but they remain stubbornly forgettable. Only ""Seahorse"", a classic-rock epic that's sort of Banhart's ""Layla"", rises far above mimicry, but even it doesn't make any moves that you can't see coming.
Smokey does have a handful of songs that capture Banhart's idiosyncratic mix of odd folk and warbling emotion. For the most part, this happens when he keeps things simple: Opener ""Cristobal"" is a modest tune with a worm-like melody, while ""Tonada Yanomaminista"" is energetic and sharp, practically caffeinated compared to the sluggishness around it. Even better is ""Bad Girl"", whose gentleness is hypnotic rather than sleepy, much the way the slower shuffles on Stephen Malkmus' solo albums find tension in patient strolls. Over small slide guitar and pitter-pat percussion, Banhart's tale of romantic ambivalence is achingly pretty.
    Similar simplicity bolsters the album's end. The Gordon Lightfoot-esque soft rocker ""Freely"" benefits from a nice Banhart vocal turn, while the wistful piano and voice of ""I Remember"" feels like an update of ""Autumn's Child"" from 2004's Rejoicing in the Hands. Best is the final cut, ""My Dearest Friend."" As Banhart bemoans how he will ""die from loneliness,"" the track does the opposite, gaining strength from its unadorned setting and lack of heavy effects, indulgent flourishes, or winking genre baggage. It's a strong way to close Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, but an even stronger reminder of how much better Banhart can be."
339	22409	Bruce Springsteen was a young man for the span of two albums. His twin releases from 1973, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, were populated by teenage tramps who skipped school, acted cool, stayed out all night, and, generally, felt all right. By the time Born to Run was released in the summer of 1975, Springsteen was starting to put his childish things away. “Maybe we ain’t that young anymore,” he sang on the opener “Thunder Road,” and he acted accordingly. From that point forward, Springsteen’s music was filled with more hardened characters: men with death in their eyes, women who were hated for just being born. Everything about his records, from his increasingly gruff vocals to his toughening physical appearance, seemed to signal a push toward maturity. “I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man,” he sang on 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of Town, as if the authoritative chug of his band and his mean, clean-shaven mug on the cover didn’t say as much already.The most immediate selling point of Chapter and Verse, a new compilation accompanying Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, is that it extends Bruce’s on-record adolescence by five songs. In addition to the 13 album tracks he selected to represent his growth as a songwriter, the set also features, for the first time on an officially sanctioned Springsteen release, music predating his tenure on Columbia Records. For the most part, it’s clear why these tracks have never been a part of the larger Springsteen story, why he never felt the urge to pull a Mudcrutch. They mostly find Springsteen trying on different personas, looking for a sound that fits. The set opens with “Baby I,” a primitive cut from 1966 by his teenage crew the Castiles, and then we get the Townshend-worship garage rock of the following year’s “You Can’t Judge a Book By Its Cover,” while 1970’s “He’s Guilty (The Judge Song),” by his early band Steel Mill, is a simple, Southern fried sing-a-long. While none of these cuts will knock “Sad Eyes” out of your top 300, 1972’s “Ballad of Jesse James” is the set’s biggest revelation. Boasting a Levon Helm-worthy chorus (“Don’t you wanna be an outlaw, children?”) and introducing many of the musicians who remain a benchmark of Springsteen’s sound today, “Jesse James” showcases Springsteen’s already-arena-sized ambition at a time when he didn’t necessarily have anything important to say. It also feels like the first moment on the album where a recognizable Bruce emerges. The guitar solo forecasts the heavier work he’d do on Darkness, while the caterwaul at the end sounds a good deal like the one that would eventually close out “Backstreets.” Even the outlaw narrative is something Springsteen would return to again. Of the five new songs collected here, this is the one you might want to start preparing a sign for when the next E Street tour rolls around.After that initial run, we’re left with a tidy run-through of Springsteen’s discography. The tie-in with the memoir means that we’re focusing largely on his more personal work. Gone from the set are the more character-based tracks that appeared on 2003’s comprehensive The Essential Bruce Springsteen and 1995’s chart-focussed Greatest Hits. In other words, no “Hungry Heart,” no “Atlantic City,” no “Glory Days.” He does, however, make room for 1995’s literally-based-on-a-fictional-character “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and 2002’s fireman’s lament “The Rising.” But these tracks speak to a crucial aspect of Springsteen’s work: Despite the long monologues he’s been known to deliver at shows, his music has never been all that autobiographical. A telling anecdote about Bruce involves his right-hand-man Steve Van Zandt berating him at the inclusion of the confessional “Ain’t Got You” on 1987’s Tunnel of Love. “Nobody gives a shit about your life,” the guitarist told him, “They need you for their lives. That’s your thing.” (We’ll see how Van Zandt responds when the sales reports for Bruce’s memoir come in.)Whether Springsteen’s songs tell his story or our story, the tale is one for the ages. Much of Springsteen’s catalog was designed specifically to grow old with him (“If you wrote them well, they sustain,” Springsteen told a journalist this year when asked about touring 35-year-old songs.) Chapter and Verse arranges his work in a way that rings true to his journey. Following the opening string of songs, “Born to Run,” sounds here like the revelation that it was: a perfect distillation of the music he loved and a culmination of the work he had already done. Same goes for 1987’s “Brilliant Disguise,” a ballad sung with the urgency of an artist finally finding the words to express exactly what’s been on his mind. Other cuts like “Badlands” and “Born in the U.S.A.” help move his story along, illustrating the new vocabulary and sounds that defined the albums each track introduced.The more recent selections are equally powerful. “Living Proof” from 1992 is a should-be classic that captures the rush of emotions accompanying new fatherhood. “Long Time Comin’,” a song penned in the ’90s but not released on a record until the mid 2000s, is another gem. During early performances of it, Springsteen introduced it as one of his rare “happy songs,” but its joyful tone got buried by the more morose material on Devils & Dust; here it feels utterly euphoric. “Wrecking Ball,” a divisive song about a sports complex penned in 2009 to commemorate the closing of Giants Stadium, also speaks to a lot more in this context. In six minutes, it refits “Born to Run”’s momentum to a less glamorous narrative, refining the heart of Springsteen’s muse into seven short words: “Hard times come, and hard times go.” That message is also reflected by the album’s flow, spanning from “Baby I”’s prepubescent power-pop through the ghostly “My Father’s House” and finally landing on a place of acceptance.“I always picture it as a car,” Springsteen said of his career in a recent Vanity Fair interview. “All your selves are in it. And a new self can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?” The last few years have seen an uncharacteristic turn toward nostalgia for Springsteen that’s led from 2014’s Album Collection Vol. 1 to this year’s River Tour and the upcoming memoir. With the opening five songs, more than 60% of Chapter and Verse is pre-Born in the U.S.A., giving a heavy skew toward his early days. It’s clear that this wasn’t designed as a greatest hits set, or even a Springsteen-for-beginners mixtape. Hopefully, it proves to be an excuse to move forward and a way to leave the past behind. You can imagine any number of similarly structured compilations (maybe one of his love songs that opens with “For You” and peaks with “If I Should Fall Behind,” or a politically-charged one that draws a line from “Lost in the Flood” to “Matamoros Banks”). Chapter and Verse takes a relatively safe route, but it’s a beautiful ride: one where everyone in the car feels united and hellbent on making it out alive.
16875	6230	"Some of you might be unaware that Pere Ubu is even a functioning band anymore.  Hey, that's understandable;
    they've kept a low profile stateside for years now, and have been hopping from label to label since their
    post-hiatus comeback, The Tenement Year saw release on Fontana in 1987.  But the truth is they
    never really went away. They've taken a few multi-year hiatuses, sure-- even gone through more line-up
    changes than the '87 Indians-- but they've been out there, hitting and missing with a slew of albums since
    the mid-70s.

    And if you are haven't been keeping up with Cleveland's finest export since Roberto Alomar then it might
    surprise you to find out they're still pretty much on top of their game (which you can't say for Alomar).
    All 14 people who bought their '98 effort Pennsylvania, back me up on this.  I too was a Ubu-doubter,
    believing they'd faded into irrelevance around about 1983, but then I happened upon Griel Marcus' ""Best
    Albums of '98"" list and found Pennsylvania sitting pretty at #1.  I wanted to believe Marcus-- after
    all, I do stay up late into the night bent over my heavily worn copy of Invisible Republic, peering
    Kabala-like for eschatological insight and stock market tips, but I must say I was a tad skeptical.  Figured
    Marcus was just putting us on, trying to be difficult and outspoken. Still, the curiosity had me.

    So after doing some recon, I located a copy of that record in a little shop just south Terre Haute, Indiana,
    and to my delight I found Marcus' estimation of the album to be pretty freaking accurate. ""Best album of 1998""
    is a ridiculous claim, but it's solid straight through and its hermetic vision of the American cultural
    landscape was novel and pleasantly confounding. It was the kind of album that, had it been a young band's
    debut, would have caused a much bigger fuss, but as it stood it was an album from a bunch of arty geezers
    led by a washed-up Beefheart imitator, and so it passed largely unnoticed by the small chunk of listening
    public that might have possibly cared.

    Gentlemen, now's your chance to get in on the ground level with the follow-up, St. Arkansas.  When
    ol' Griel releases his Best of 2002 and maybe a dozen people rush to their local wax-monger, you can be
    all, ""Shit, dude, I've had that album since summer,"" and appear really wise.  Mind you, I'm not saying this
    is the best album of the year-- although, barring the absolutely unexpected, it will race neck-and-neck
    with Neil Young's Are You Passionate? for worst cover art of the year. They share that first-year
    Photoshop quality usually reserved for only the best Blue Oyster Cult double live albums on CMC International.

    As for the music, though, St. Arkansas is roundly excellent, which no one in possession of their
    critical faculty and any one other Neil Young record can say of Passionate. It's a companion piece of
    sorts to Pennsylvania and shares much the same vocabulary, though St. Arkansas is the darker of
    the two.  Which is to say, it's more subdued and less rock-oriented, relying more on beat-style spoken-word
    storytelling and found sound.  There are some decently angular post-punk guitar moves here though-- something
    to show the kids who's boss-- but this incarnation of Pere Ubu relies just as much on its rhythm section.

    Singer and frontman David Thomas (who somehow finds time to lead this band in addition to running like a
    bajillion burger joints and also recently dying) is in top form. He sounds less and less like Captain
    Beefheart as time goes on, and more like what you'd get if Jim Henson had been commissioned to create an
    animatron android of William S. Burroughs, like for Chuck E. Cheese or something. I realize this description
    is a bit ambiguous (these supposed to be good qualities?) but so is Thomas' voice-- it can be funny and
    scary simultaneously, both annoying and enthralling. Exploring the difference between wheezing and whining,
    sometimes brooding and sometimes absurdly chipper, it's an incredibly expressive instrument.

    As far as I can tell, St. Arkansas is the complex tale of a sharp-dressed trucker (a ZZ Top fan, one
    might assume) whose passion in life is the open road.  He also has a thing for AM radio that I don't really
    get; the only good thing I've ever heard on AM was Art Bell and Cincinnati Reds broadcasts, and neither
    ever offered anything like what I'd call salvation. I can only assume Thomas is talking about some bygone
    era of AM, maybe the one Jonathan Richman so joyously celebrated in ""Roadrunner."" The tone here is wholly
    different, though. When Thomas repeats the mantra-like refrain, ""The radio/ AM radio/ Oh, the radio will set
    you free,"" on album-closing ""Dark,"" it's not a hopeful assurance but rather a mournful, wistful recollection
    of a promise heard long ago during a simpler, more innocent time.

    To make a long and oblique story short, the trucker loses his hold on reality, ditches his wife and friends,
    and drives off a bridge or cliff or something, or maybe into a deep dark forest. It's obvious the songs form
    some sort of larger narrative, but beyond that, it's hard to know exactly what's happening. There's some
    water involved, and a ""ring of fire"" he must ""feed,"" and some greasy spoon diner where everyone is welcome.
    I don't exactly think this was meant to be some sort of mystery to be unlocked like a David Lynch movie. You
    can have fun trying to figure it all out and connect all the recurring imagery, but likewise, you can just
    let it roll and enjoy the ride."
17932	6305	"In the museums of the distant future, America will be reduced to an
    animatronic Wild West saloon, with the Pinetop Seven's Bringing Home the
    Last Great Strike stuck on a perpetual loop. We'll be nothing but a
    kickline, a poker game, and a roomful of hard luck stories. Everything will
    be dusty. The anachronisms will be lost on our descendents. We'll have been
    an empire of cowboys. It's not such a bad obituary.
Bringing Home the Last Great Strike would definitely not count as
    insurgent country; there isn't a punk bone in its body. It's an incredible
    line-up of bruised and tired music where folk, bluegrass, Louisville
    post-rock, Eastern music and electronics all drink side by side. As pristine
    and complex as the arrangements sound, the album's been kicked around and
    beaten up. Brimming with unglamorous stories of circus freaks, drifters,
    stranglers, ghosts, and drunks, Pinetop Seven have crafted a rich, melancholy
    work of music for the unemployable.

    And vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist Darren Richard seems to play
    barkeep to the whole lot of them, telling their stories as if he'd eavesdropped
    on them, sometimes even assuming the voice of their own confessionals. The
    record store guy warned me about the vocals: too white, too nasally, too
    haunted, he said. But in truth, I've come to adore them; a dire, warbling
    falsetto somewhere between Jeff Magnum, Jeff Buckley and Jeremy Enigk. The
    bizarre instrumentation and languid arrangements lend the music an almost
    timeless quality, drawing you in while the searching vocals repel. You may
    come to love them as I have but many will be discouraged. After all, they're
    quite white, nasally, and irremediably haunted. Fair warning, in any case.

    The introductory fanfare, ""As the Mutiny Sleeps,"" is a somber homage to the
    Band's ""Theme from the Last Waltz,"" twittering with bells and glockenspiel
    while a muted trumpet whimpers and dour clarinet calls the album's plodding
    approach. ""On the Last Ride In"" is a lazy, twanging tale of departure. The
    drifter's regret is a familiar theme, but Richard's evocative lyrics lend
    color and depth to the sketch: ""From under the clouds/ His father's face/
    Promising rain, rain, rain/ And all sides came crashing down."" One of the
    more traditionally instrumented tracks on The Last Great Strike, the
    acoustic strum melds with the soft Fender Rhodes, upright bass and distant
    violin. ""An empty trunk no longer full of all that trust,"" Darren intones as
    the music recedes.

    ""A Black Eye to Be Proud Of"" is one of the record's standouts; emerging from
    electronic loops, fat vaudeville piano stomps out the melody. Darren Richard
    assumes the first-person narrative of a young man who's fallen in love with a
    whore: ""But Leah, I think that could change/ I've got money for you to teach
    me."" The narrator is a boy compared to the brothel's other clientele: ""My own
    black eye to be proud of never came/ I'm a coward still the same/ Skinny arms
    and watery eyes."" The Pinetop Seven have cited director Jim Jarmusch as an
    influence, and in ""Black Eye,"" that influence becomes apparent, rewriting the
    conventions of the unrequited love song with humor and subtle sadness.

    ""Ten Thousand to Carlisle Came"" opens with an alarum of Middle Eastern horns
    and proceeds into a profoundly disturbing country-western ballad about a
    deaf-mute girl that's become a roadside attraction: ""To spite us in car loads/
    They came to see this sadness displayed."" The song's final verse is
    particularly horrific, but sung with the slight distance of the greatest
    storytellers: ""Cut the lights off/ Pull the car close/ Let the gasoline run/
    Beneath the locked door/ Throw the match down/ Let her sleep.""

    ""At His Kitchen Table"" executes a rustbelt tribute to Slint's ""Breadcrumb
    Trail""; a dead, insistent guitar-lick, the blank spoken-word narrative. Vibes
    punctuate the monologue as a maelstrom of howling electronics blows beneath.
    The bored observational candor is pure Brian McMahan as Richard intones: ""A
    sound outside finally caught his attention and he looked out the window
    across the street to where a young mother was yelling.  She was yelling at
    her little boy who had found a dead bird and brought it into the house."" The
    narrative goes exactly nowhere.

    Wheezing Keen-O-Tone keyboards and skillet percussions mark the final song
    with a vocal track, ""A Friend to the Minnesota Strangler,"" a sketch of the
    relationship between a fugitive serial killer and the bird he ""kept in a hat
    box by his bed."" Richard plucks the nylon guitar strings like plucking on the
    nerves themselves in pointed, rhythmic pops.  ""The Minnesota Strangler"" fades
    into the final track, ""Buried in St. Cloud,"" a funereal procession of bass
    clarinet, flugelhorn, accordion and cello winding all stories down to their
    inevitable conclusions.
Bringing Home the Last Great Strike is unique in trafficking so
    liberally in human misery without ever approaching angst. Richard deftly
    avoids every inclination to wallow in his characters' misfortunes as a cipher
    for his own, while also never deriving the kind of morbid thrill in the rustic
    bizarre like a certain sister-/mountain-fucking Kentuckian whose music is
    often strikingly parallel. The Last Great Strike is a jukebox anthology
    of American unhappiness. All its nostalgia seems directed toward a more
    miserable time. This, in the end, seems to be the West worth remembering."
3161	19303	"It seems like there should be a little more perplexing mystery to Sd Laika than there actually is: Peter Runge is basically a guy from Milwaukee with a low-key social media presence and enough of a distinct game plan to wind up on the same label as Forest Swords and Evian Christ. But Runge's music possesses an unnerving sense of man-machine fusion that sends viscera burbling out your speakers—the kind of glitched-out muck that leaves a permanent stain on everything in hearable radius and makes one thankful that you can't actually smell music. It's gruesomely tactile, dank stuff, the kind of keyboard gut-ripping that primarily resembles grime in the ""Crime scene clean-up"" sense of the word.Two years ago, Runge put out the Unknown Vectors EP, which took the more abrasive qualities of grime and bass music, sharpened their edges to the border of discomfort, and kicked their surefooted steps out from beneath them to leave their rhythms scrambling. Since then, he's only pushed that discomfort further, something that his new LP That's Harakiri brings to deeper fruition. There's some real agitation on this thing—beats that rattle like a loose drive belt, ambient percussion that sounds sourced from the static left after Earth's last radio transmission, gurgling drones on some ""all glory to the Hypnotoad"" shit—and there's no real accessible way into it.The sick stuff's enough to shake off the unwary, and the opening one-two of ""Peace"" and ""Great God Pan"" put the most difficult aspects of Runge's music right up front. The former's a scrambled broadcast that pits trebly squeaks of inside-out digital strings against heaving meat-slab synth, resembling less a beat than a creeping caustic ooze. The latter track throws out the pastoral flute-tootling its title might imply in favor of glo-fi catatonia; there's analog hisses that give off enough neon heat to leave blisters, while a machine shop's worth of misfiring pistons plays percussion. While there are signs of order to grab on to—the straightforward 808 boom-clap beat that marches through closer ""Percressing,"" or the batterram 4/4 kicks that churn through the loud-yet-minimalist ""Remote Heaven""—the sense of short-circuit disorder is never far away, which gives That's Harakiri the feel of pulling order through chaos. Noise interference is ramped up, as are counterintuitive rhythms and ugly chords, only to tie them all together into an unexpected sort of cohesion. The mutated-grime signifiers give his songs a bit of grounding; there are these juddering Wiley-style Eski beats and bleeps in ""I Don't"" and ""You Were Wrong"" that move a little funny because they've lost a few toes to frostbite. And the pulse really does get insistently catchy once you've given in to the havoc: for all the moaning buzzes and Tesla-coil sparks that scorch its surface, ""Meshes"" also has a remarkably supple and intricate chattering beat down beneath that could goe toe-to-toe with your favorite Major Lazer cut for ass-shaking potential. There's a sense here that Runge is reacting to the clockwork sleekness and futurist warmth of Grime 2.0 and Night Slugs/Fade to Mind bass music with deliberate violence—not out of hostility, just a fascination with what happens when all those parts start malfunctioning. In the case of That's Harakiri, that malfunction just turns out to be another kind of fine working order."
16193	7278	"For over twenty years, Bill Callahan has been finding devious new ways of defying expectations. Whether
    playing the role of the lo-fi pioneer, the boisterous noise-making prankster, or the darkly smirking
    balladeer, Callahan has always made music brimming with tension and complexity. When Callahan is at his
    best, a squealing, distorted guitar can break your heart, a rumination on death can make you laugh, and
    a joke can make you hate yourself. In a sense, Callahan's best work is often the most difficult to listen
    to-- a tapestry of revelation, humor, despair, beauty, and noise hardly qualifies as easy listening.
Supper, Callahan's eleventh proper album as Smog, is a lovely collection of songs. Alternating
    between confident mid-tempo rockers and acoustic portraits of domestic bliss, this is without doubt one
    of his most accessible efforts to date. Which is exactly why it's not his best. Though certainly not a
    bad album, Supper lacks the unique, often disturbing touch that makes the best of Callahan's work
    so compelling. And though the more subversive side of Callahan's songwriting does occasionally manifest
    itself in more subdued ways, it's not enough to render the album anything more than pleasant.
    Callahan opens Supper with ""Feather by Feather"", a song that bears a striking resemblance to the
    works of Drag City labelmate Will Oldham. In fact, Oldham's Master and Everyone serves as a good
    point of reference for the more whimsical side of this record.  Master and Everyone marked an even
    more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of Oldham's I See a Darkness than
    2001's Ease Down the Road, as well as from Oldham's preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and
    having sex with Death.  As a result, Master and Everyone was prettier, but also more reliant on
    traditional signifiers of ""pretty"" than on Oldham's unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, Supper
    suppresses both Callahan's talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and his tendency towards
    understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar.
    Still, ""Feather by Feather""-- along with ""Vessel in Vain"", ""Truth Serum"" and ""Our Anniversary""-- stands as
    a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre.  Callahan's Hammond organ, Ken Champion's pedal steel and Sarabeth Tucek's
    breathy backing vocals combine to paint the very same portrait of subdued domesticity that Oldham seemed to
    be working towards on Master and Everyone. Sadly, a close examination of this portrait reveals
    paint-by-numbers outlines faintly detectable behind the color and texture of Callahan's unique baritone.
    Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on Supper are vastly superior to its
    bland, awkward electric rockers. As the BBC Session recording of ""I Break Horses"" featured in this year's
    singles compilation Accumulation: None clearly demonstrated, Callahan is more than capable of carrying
    off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed Callahan
    seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both heartless and heartbroken. The
    heavier numbers on Supper, however, simply drop Callahan's disaffected voice over displaced Rolling
    Stones-isms. Jim O'Rourke's Insignificance proved that such a formula can yield incredible results
    when executed with wit and finesse, but here, the awkwardness that makes much of Callahan's music so
    heartrending doesn't always work in his favor.
    Regardless, Supper is not without strong moments. The album's last tracks, ""Driving"" and ""A Guiding
    Light"", actually break from the disappointingly formulaic sound that Callahan utilizes for the album's
    majority. ""Driving"" turns the record's serene acoustic arrangements into something chaotic, layering plucked
    banjo and sparse, arrhythmic drumming atop occasional flourishes of warm, clean electric guitar. As the song
    progresses, it seems to become both more structured and overwhelming, as its ever-expanding stratum seems to
    congeal into a more regular pattern. ""A Guiding Light"" most closely resembles the Smog of days past, with
    Callahan's chilling voice accompanied only by a haunting, repetitive guitar figure and minimal percussion.
    Unfortunately, even these two relatively strong songs don't hold a candle to the greatest in Smog's back
    catalog.
    Throughout his career, Callahan has managed to wear many aesthetic masks while still coming through with
    something unique and interesting.  At his best, he's evoked vivid, complex imagery with a single well-placed
    word or sound.  It would be nice to say that he simply hides behind the machinations of docile country-folk
    and steady riff-rock on Supper to more insidiously convey his distinctively dark musical sense. But
    I get the distinct impression that all of Callahan's cards are on the table here-- where beneath the
    instrumentation there once lied depth and cutting truth, there is now only complacency."
1864	20673	"On their third full-length, More Faithful, Montreal shoegazers No Joy make it clear that they're not afraid to shift their sights towards the sky once in awhile. Although their songs still possess the signature qualities of the genre—fuzzy guitars and repetitive, mantra-like refrains—there are hints that the band is trying to expand within it, breaking through the sometimes-monotonous din with moments of light. It's a hard album to pin down, at moments bright and tender, at times as dark and scuzzy, and the contrast helps mitigate the sameness that sometimes plagued their previous efforts.Beginning with their second LP Wait to Pleasure and continuing through the 2013 EP Pastel and Pass Out, you could hear the band seeking ways to deepen their sound. More Faithful was recorded with Ariel Pink producer Jorge Elbrecht in Brooklyn and Costa Rica, and there's a little bit of the city and moments of the sea present on nearly every track. ""Moon in My Mouth"", a psyched-out, dreamy track with a swaying, beach-punk riff, showcases singer Jazamine White-Gluz's bright vocals and lulls the listener. It's punk rock taken poolside, city mice taking a break from the harsh squall. The sound is both massive and soft around its edges, layering elements of surf-rock and psychedelia into the harsh din of Laura Lloyd's guitars.Light and dark are constantly at play across the album's surface, like shadows from moving clouds. Album opener ""Remember Nothing"" is a dissonant, clanging contrast to the mellow vibes of ""Moon"", opening with a fast, hi-hat-reliant drum beat and a muddy riff that wouldn't sound out of place on a Sonic Youth record. Then the vocals enter, and leaven the murk with a hint of tenderness. ""Burial in Twos"" starts out spacious and gorgeous, with a wide-open ringing riff and pinging synth hits, before some gristly electric guitars enter and grind their teeth.There's a feeling that nothing on the album is accidental. The squealing, careening ""Chalk Snake"", which is so Jesus and Mary Chain-esque it veers into the realm of pastiche, ends by juxtaposing a high-pitched note of guitar squall with a piano line that almost sounds like Joni Mitchell. It's these subversive little moments that help No Joy avoid the diminishing returns that often plagues shoegazers. And although they're still obviously committed to noise, still praying at the fuzzy altar of My Bloody Valentine, they're a band that's still evolving, and letting a little bit of light in through the cracks has served them well."
453	22270	On the surface, Steve Hoover’s documentary Almost Holy could be a feel-good story. Its protagonist, altruistic Russian priest Gennadiy Mokhnenko, rescues and rehabilitates homeless, drug-addicted youths from the streets of the Ukraine. Judging solely by the soundtrack, though, it sounds like a horror movie. With half its songs made by brothers Leopold and Atticus Ross (the latter a partner with Trent Reznor in scoring David Fincher films) and the other half by Bobby Krlic (aka the Haxan Cloak), Almost Holy’s music is heavy, pounding, and at times purely bombastic.It turns out that Mokhnenko himself has a dark side—some reviews of Almost Holy suggest his savior tactics verge on abduction—that dovetails with all these ominous sounds. But regardless of their role in the accompanying film, the songs on Almost Holy work as worlds of their own. The producers craft dense environments with reverberating drones, soaring synths, and heartbeat-like rhythms. A few approach the melodramatic foreboding of John Carpenter. But the music of Almost Holy is less about narrative than atmosphere.That’s in keeping with both the recent soundtrack work of the Rosses and Krlic’s last effort as Haxan Cloak, which Pitchfork’s Nick Neyland called “more soundtrack than regular album.” Nobody here delivers anything unexpected, but all three play well to their strengths, which overlap significantly. The echoing, apparitional tones of Krlic’s cavernous “Pharmacies” and the brittle “Coursing” show his knack for turning alien abstractions and discordant textures into moving music. The Rosses’ contributions are more conventional but just as effective, especially “Punching Bag,” which morphs from metallic sheen into a grinding pulse, and the harrowing dissonance of “Distance.”Almost Holy only falters when it drifts toward the generic. That’s a danger with any soundtrack, since music that has to serve multiple purposes can easily get reduced to a common denominator. In opener “One Block Further,” the Rosses’ rote piano chords and default beat resemble library music filed under “dramatic techno.” But more often, conventional tropes work in the producers’ favor. Take Krlic’s closer “The End,” which plays like an obvious denouement, as rising, choir-like tones cascade into a bombed-out climax—and yet, every moment is tense and gripping. Like the rest of Almost Holy, the idea may be familiar, but the execution is compelling.
17734	2757	"A lot of albums kick off with the killer track. Some even manage a cool one-two punch. Missy Elliott's
    third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially
    contemporary R&B.;  I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this
    first-rate succession ends.  But even with this initial run of excellence, So Addictive has
    much more in store.

    Elliott makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range
    of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak
    On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning.  In fact, there's
    more singing on this record than rapping.  Elliott's low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious
    screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control.  In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly
    berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for choir
    robes.""

    ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and
    drum thunk.  Elliott piles layers of vocals atop Timbaland's multiplying strings and rattles, and
    eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. Redman and Method Man also
    provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma.  Elsewhere, Missy harmonizes with herself on ""One
    Minute Man"", again keeping the beat simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing
    Ludacris to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere pit stop, but a full
    night's stay at Casa de Intercourse.

    Missy finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent.
    ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy phrasings
    and vocal eruptions that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic
    ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver labyrinthine rhythm structures like ""Lexus Jeeps"".
    Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it
    used so effectively.  Timbaland's technique is undeniably masterful, too, as he plays with meter,
    dynamics and expectations, allowing Missy to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over surreal
    stillness and silence.

    ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while Elliott details
    a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like
    something the Bomb Squad used to blast for Public Enemy.  ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the
    beat"", keeping So Addictive stylistically varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights.
    Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay homage to P-Funk, but rather than mimicking the
    seminal funkateers, Missy integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an
    otherwise tired influence.  ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early Prince ballads, and instead
    reveals how those slow R&B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song.  And despite
    having already proven herself more than capable of similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out
    vocoder, and irrationally allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning.
So Addictive is further held back by sporadic low points during its second half.  Not even
    reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that
    neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere.  Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One
    Minute Man"", featuring Jay-Z, and a religious bonus track that has its mind, and length, set on
    eternity.

    Still, there are three absolutely killer songs on So Addictive's second half. ""4 My People""
    features Missy at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring
    the beat back.""  ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some
    fierce guest turns by Da Brat and Jade.  And, after a pointless but impressive Busta Rhymes interlude,
    ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with Timbaland's guttural rap and a rumbling beat that loops around
    itself like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate.  Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons
    and hover like boomerangs while background guitar sounds wail like ghost cats in heat.

    Of course, to say Miss E is addictive is pushing it.  Sure, I'm having a great time experimenting
    with this stuff right now.  But I can stop any time I want."
5519	16558	"Garage-rock's secret recipe has always been one part loving memory to two parts imperfect recall. The best stuff misremembers what it enshrines, producing a jarring little chamber of echoes that plays upon beloved memories while confusing them-- I love this song/wait, is this how this song goes? Ty Segall and White Fence's Tim Presley are masters of garage-rock's indirection game; their collaborative album, Hair, is an absorbing, bleary maze of detours and red herrings. To hear them steer their demented little dune buggy through rock history is not unlike partaking in the American history lessons that Abe Simpson pieced together ""mostly through sugar packets"": All the familiar players are here, but they're acting funny.The songs they write together -- Segall on drums and rhythm guitar, Presley on bass and lead-- are not anthems. They are puzzles built from rock-music parts, and you don't pump your fist to a puzzle. But they are peculiarly absorbing, and they only grow more so with repeated listening. In every song, there's a jump, an oomph, a missing-reel moment, in which a sudden left turn devours a song whole or a stray thread bumps everything off the designed course. The opener, ""Time"", eases its way into a sweetly evocative folk-rock strum, pitched so accurately you get instantly lost trying to track it: something from George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, maybe? But then, in its last minute, the song drops into a forceful blurt of fuzz guitars so abruptly that its tendons nearly snap. It's a bracing reminder that you are not, in fact, listening to George Harrison.Segall and Presley are both tinkerers like this, the sort of people who seemingly enjoy pulling support beams out of their songs to see how well they hop along without them. Songs start somewhere rote and then slowly topple over before they end. ""Easy Ryder"" begins in a place so familiar that your ears dilate: a straight-ahead Ventures surf lick, a lazy drum shuffle, and lyrics intoning the title. But when the halfway-point guitar solo pop ups, on cue, it noodles away past its designated end, pecking determinedly away at the song until the relationship between the two begins to resemble this dynamic. ""Scissor People"" starts with a Yardbirds-style riff, but when it breaks down to a one-chord vamp, it keeps breaking down into smaller and blurrier parts, interrupting itself until it just bangs its head against a  corner repeatedly. It's a quizzical chaos, a cocktail of adrenaline and neurosis.Some of this schizophrenia stems from Segall and Presley's differing temperaments. As White Fence, Presley tends to be sleepier and more abstracted; Segall's music is wilder and unconstrained. Their union feels intriguingly unstable: You can almost pinpoint the moment on the narcotized psych-folk ballad ""The Black Glove/Rag"" where Segall grows restless with the song's tempo and wrests control of it, steering it into a field of tires. They are interesting enough together that the stuff that sounds like it took 20 total minutes to cook up and record (the hiccuping rockabilly of ""Crybaby"") glows with their singular weirdness. At eight songs and under half an hour, Hair is short, but full of enough odd little fillips-- the creepy whispers that open ""The Black Glove/Rag"", the stumbling, quasi-solemn ""1-2-3-4"" countdown that opens ""Time""-- that it feels like a world. Given the incestuous, collaborative nature of the San Francisco psych-rock playground, it's likely that these two will make more music together. I hope they never figure each other out completely."
14037	4593	"Oh shit, Snax on the mix! Matt B on the fat B! Back the fuck up! Here
    comes motherfucking Erlend, doing that motherfucking thing he does!
    Fuckingshit C+C electro Power Rangers! Sweet weed with dicks, Øye's
    making his Ø-face!
    No doubt, this album was a blast to record-- a party-and-a-half in a
    small room with only awesome dudes. If Hello Stranger isn't
    terra nova, Berlin's old man technogloom DJ Kaos has definitely loosened
    up a bit since the other things he used to do. Here he's collaborated
    with old and new buds alike, coming up with this programmatically fun
    italo punk-funk chi-house post-9/11 distillation of every remotely
    trendy genre coolly revisited in the last five years. Divatox, this is
    your worst nightmare.
    Copies of copies of copies, whatever-- some of these songs are actually
    likable. Kaos and dudes know each sound's sweet spot, picking, cutting,
    and pasting only the most time-tested licks for nine flawless
    test-tube babies. These songs look human, but they will never know
    their parents-- especially something like Gattacampy opener ""Lessons In
    Love"", which is all breathy electro vox and understated italo swells and lines
    like ""Lessons in love/ Where does it go from here?"" Better still is ""Now
    And Forever""-- jangly chromatic rhythm postpunkin, octave bass slaps,
    cowbell, falsetto chorus, a pisspoor guitar solo, timbales, and-- wait
    for it-- cowbell.
    Written out, the album sounds bloated. But most tracks on Hello
    Stranger take more than seven minutes to unravel, lending this LP a DJ set vibe. First come
    the drink-on tracks, then the hard rockers, then Snax to the max, then
    the early morning too-drunk-to-care-what-the-DJ-plays tracks (these tracks on Hello Stranger are kinda
    boring), then the DJ runs out of stuff to play and combs for his least
    shitty B-sides (these tracks on Hello Stranger sorta
    suck), then, finally, a ""last song"" track, which, in LCDspeak, erases
    the whole album so we can spin it again. That track on Hello
    Stranger sounds erasey.
    Yup.
    For the record: Captain Snax got his duefork a few weeks ago here.
    Random and overly reductive: I find the similarities among the Out
    Hud, LCD, and Kaos albums-- same number of tracks (cutting Out Hud's
    28-second intro), ""last songs,"" openly referential and genre-based,
    none of them as dancey as people expected them to be-- somewhat
    amusing.
    Insightful and more important than anything I've said so far: Midway
    through 80s D-train groove ""Juices"" is a pretty terrible impression of
    Louis Armstrong, but to its credit, it's also the first Kirstie-Alley-impersonating-Louis-Armstrong impression in recorded history."
13439	7830	"Ivan the Terrible is almost too perfect a poster boy for the current state
    of electrowhatever, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard
    and general air of swarthy French sleaziness. As one half of Black Strobe,
    he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and
    electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other
    words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a
    DJ he's defined his strain of electrohouse (better names on a postcard, as
    always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria
    or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog
    eyes?)
Fabric23 doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are
    quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true
    shop-blurb style. As my boy Phil noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone
    is worshipping the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are
    dragging their knuckles down. Ivan does know a bassline when he hears it,
    usually in short blurts of boom that occasionally reach out to slap you
    awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix
    kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing
    a coastal town in mid-July.
    Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit)
    is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!""
    is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. Michael Mayer's
    ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm
    surprised he went with the clicking melodies of DJ Koze's ""The Geklöppel
    Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"".
    Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as
    incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of
    Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of Konrad Black's
    ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other
    is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the bulk of
    the mix.
Fabric23 is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance
    music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not all
    the time, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black
    holes of good taste and excessive abstraction. Unfortunately, it's a weird
    kind of rock purism Smagghe leans on, not all that different from the
    excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just
    with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's. Is one anthem too much to
    ask Ivan? Or am I missing the point?"
8403	13657	"When we last left the Mary Onettes, the Swedish quartet was diligently channeling the sounds of the 1980s without a lick of the irony that often imbues such revivalism. Their retro moves seemed less about building upon the decade's musical legacy as encapsulating its finer points for consumption by a new generation. Which, hey, was a perfectly cool way to go about things. At their best, the band positively nailed the bruised romanticism and exquisite melancholy that marked a certain strain of that decade's best pop, and besides, most of the signature propagators of said pop were by then long gone or, worse yet, distant shadows of their former selves. Plus it's not like you'll catch any of the old guard in the tiny-ish clubs and early-afternoon festival slots the Mary Onettes are used to playing, so for those seeking stadium-sized grandeur in parlor-intimate spaces, the band has something relatively unique to offer. The self-titled The Mary Onettes from 2007, in fact, turned out not unlike many records from the era it emulated: several excellent singles or would-be singles (""Lost"", ""Slow"", ""Void"", ""Under the Guillotine""), the token slow jam (""The Laughter""), an effective opener and closer (""Pleasure Songs"" and ""Still"", respectively), and, well, some not terribly memorable stuff in between. All of which makes Islands, the Mary Onettes' follow-up, an at once enchanting and frustrating listen. Yes, the high points of the previous record are duplicated here-- but so too are the same problems that occasionally bogged down that record.Opener ""Puzzles"" actually betters The Mary Onettes' lead track, the great-tune-with-questionable-lyrics ""Pleasure Songs"", galloping along on a spritely keyboard riff and setting an appropriate tone for the nine tracks to follow. ""Let's talk about what feels strange on the inside,"" vocalist Philip Ekström offers, an apt enough invitation to the scores of disaffected youngsters with which this sort of music has always resonated best. ""Dare"", ""Symmetry"", and ""The Disappearance of My Youth"", then, are the hot singlez here, and each has the band showing off a few new tricks. ""Symmetry"" gets extra sentimental with the strings, ""Dare"" soars near the heights of ""Lost"" on the strength of plenty of ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs"", and ""Disappearance"" features-- what else?-- a children's choir joining in to sing the title line. Their brief major label dalliance a half decade behind them, it's clear the Mary Onettes' ambitions haven't wavered in the least. Elsewhere, a few numbers-- notably the slow jam (""Cry for Love"") and the closer (""Bricks"")-- fall short of their counterparts on LP1. The former lacks the poise and grace of ""The Laughter"", while the latter generally sounds like a limp rehash of several earlier tracks on Islands, very much in want of a distinguishing feature. At least ""Still"" settled on a strident march beat that evoked a spirited departure off into the sunset (or, better yet, the rain); ""Bricks"" just kind of meanders off in a mid-tempo haze.Indeed, distinction would serve the rest of the tracks on Islands well; as on The Mary Onettes, the stuff in between here tends to drift by largely unnoticed. Ekström has stated that the title Islands refers to how ""every song is like a record of its very own,"" and ironically this is perhaps the biggest snare this time around: without a sonic story arc of sorts to create continuity across Islands, we're encouraged to hold the tracks against one another (hence the partitioning above into ""great"" and ""just okay"" camps) rather than consider them in relation to the whole of the album. In short, somebody needs to introduce these guys to transitions, interludes, intros, outros, deliberate sketches, ambience, that sort of thing (although, in fairness, Islands does open with a nice bit of panoramic, cloud-parting feedbackery)-- a means to more effectively tie all these so-called ""islands"" together. The otherwise unremarkable ""Century"" includes a telling line: ""I've never been good at holding back,"" Ekström declares there. Until he is, the Mary Onettes will likely remain a killer singles band that makes just pretty good albums."
12261	9325	"
    And number one on the list of phrases we'd never expect to
    see in the liner notes of a New York Dolls album: ""String samples courtesy
    of Vienna Symphonic Library."" But its appearance in the fine print on One
    Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This is only slightly less surprising
    than the existence of the album itself. Even after the glam-punk pioneers'
    triumphant, Morrissey-goaded reunion performance at London's Meltdown festival in
    June 2004, the concept of a new New York Dolls album seemed unfathomable, given
    that their star guitarist Johnny Thunders had been dead for 13 years and
    drummers Jerry Nolan and Billy Murcia had checked out long before that; with
    the sudden, leukemia-related death of bassist Arthur Kane coming just weeks
    after the reunion gig, the surviving Dolls were barely holding on to their
    plural status. But if there are only two original Dolls still alive to make a
    new record, they may as well be the ones who wrote all the songs (guitarist
    Sylvain Sylvain) and the one whose voice gave them personality (David
    Johansen). No strangers to prescient album titles (see 1974's career-killing
    Too Much Too Soon), with One Day, the Dolls
    play with a humble restraint that suggests they're just grateful to be here.
    While the Dolls' songwriting was always
    smart enough to transcend their image, the initial shock
    of the latter is what ultimately secures their place in the pre-punk canon. Beyond
    their gender-bending veneer-- more of a theatrical device than a political
    one-- the Dolls' intent was regressive rather than progressive, shamelessly
    asserting their love of antiquated forms like rockabilly and doo-wop in a
    post-hippie era preoccupied with 20-minute guitar solos and multi-sectional
    prog suites. Though an essential text for the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and
    Ramones, the Dolls' self-titled debut is really no more threatening than 1972's
    other ragged rock'n'roll masterwork, Exile on Main Street. So it follows then that One Day sounds less like the work of punk provocateurs than a Keith Richards
    solo album: grizzled rock vets backed by a nominally gritty if
    too-well-rehearsed troupe of young(er) hired guns (guitarist Steve Conte,
    bassist Sami Yaffa, keyboardist Brian Koonin, and drummer Brian Delaney). In a
    sense, the Dolls personify the changes their hometown has undergone in the past
    three decades; the streets still bustle with tension and excitement, but the
    fear of getting mugged has subsided considerably.
    One thing working in the new New York Dolls'
    favor is that the band's most enduring songs (""Personality Crisis"",
    ""Trash"") weren't confined to the typical preoccupations of young men
    looking to get laid. So where Mick Jagger still tries to play the sympathetic
    devil, Johansen is happy playing the sentimental fool. His voice has ripened
    considerably over the years-- evidence of his years belting out blues standards
    with his band the Harry Smiths-- but as charismatic a frontman Johansen
    remains, much of the new repertoire never rises far above sub-Stones pub-rock
    (""Runnin' Around"", ""Take a Good Look at My Good Looks"") or
    self-tribute (""Dance Like a Monkey"" revives both the ""ooh
    ooh"" harmonies from ""Trash"" and the safari rumble of
    ""Stranded in the Jungle"").

    Aside from the spirited soda-shop strut of
    ""Rainbow Store"", it's actually the bittersweet ballads that fare
    best: the Tom Waitsian stroll of ""Maimed Happiness"" and the
    Springsteen-sized climax ""Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano"" (featuring
    effective backing vocals from Michael Stipe) both bear evidence of the wounded
    blue-eyed soul that always lurked behind the Dolls' mascara'd lashes. But more
    importantly, they're genuine displays of vulnerability from former bad boys who
    are wise enough to know you can't put your arms around a memory.

13036	638	"In September 1997, Belle & Sebastian made their American live debut by playing a pair of CMJ shows at a synagogue in New York City's East Village. At the time, the band's U.S. debut, If You're Feeling Sinister had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences with the music weeklies. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun.

    What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with could-be fans. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the occasional mumble or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between songs. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer Stuart Murdoch's songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even Murdoch often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' ""Sessions at West 54th"" was deemed unworthy to broadcast.

    Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, Sinister-- along with a series of early EPs-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. Murdoch himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are his best songs, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried under C-86-quality sound. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering dissatisfaction with Sinister, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties Don't Look Back series-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live in its entirety-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.)

    The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to correct the fidelity of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of its longtime fans. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with Murdoch and guitarist Stevie Jackson taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five additional players. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering Murdoch's delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and existential drift with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a near-definitive reading of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about the band.

    The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of ""The Stars of Track & Field"" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. Mick Cooke's ""They Don't Know""-quoting trumpet solo is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the sonic peak.

    The tracks best served by the live recording are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap ""Me and the Major"", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older Murdoch sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. ""Like Dylan in the Movies"" and ""Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"" don't leave Murdoch as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted backdrops.

    Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been Sinister's centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of Murdoch's pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between poor decisions and desperation, doubt and faith, a need for change and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to Murdoch's words rather than leaving them stranded.

    As the band has changed and years have been placed between these track's first airings and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but their malleability, with the once-quintessential ""The Boy Done Wrong Again"" somehow seeming the most distant and out of place track here-- the claim that ""All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&S; now make. That Jackson and Murdoch, charming and almost vaudevillian-like in recent live shows, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to ""hang your head in shame and cry your life away"" is almost quaint, an odd reminder that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on late-night BBC radio sessions playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this.

    Odd then that the record closes with ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"", another in a string of tracks about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a gallop, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- some overly enthusiastic harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and ""Judy"" could have fit on the band's most recent LP.

    While arrangements here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, Murdoch's wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a hastily assembled collection of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the pride and tenderness with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more casually thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this part of their past from the safety of a different decade depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like ""Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic."
7235	14832	"In some ways it's very easy to understand why a band would keep its name after their very distinct lead singer has departed. Name recognition will ensure a certain number of people will pay attention to your new music and come out to shows. Hell, some bands, such as Pink Floyd and Genesis, became only more successful after their charismatic original singer left the group. So there's that. Mostly, however, it's a terrible idea. You run the risk of alienating your audience and tarnishing your legacy. Your new music never gets a fair chance, since it's always going to be compared unfavorably to your past glories. It's hard to grasp why the remaining members of the Concretes ever made this foolish gamble.WYWH is the second Concretes album without singer Victoria Bergsman, who left to follow her own muse with Taken By Trees. Though the Concretes were always a large band, and current singers Lisa Milberg and Maria Eriksson have been in the group all along, there is no getting around the reality that Bergsman's unmistakable voice was the most attractive and interesting thing about their music. On their brilliant self-titled debut, her heavily accented, painfully introverted presence clicked with the band's Velvet Underground-meets-Motown sound in a way that was unique and magical. Without Bergsman as an anchor, the Concretes have no particular identity. Milberg and Eriksson are good vocalists but are lacking in character, and the songwriting has become rather generic, at least in terms of icy Scandinavian indie music. It may be mostly the same musicians, but it's just not the same band that produced gems like ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Diana Ross"". Carrying on as the Concretes is at least somewhat dishonest, like an artistic bait-and-switch.In an alternate reality in which WYWH was released under a band name other than the Concretes, it would still be a mediocre effort, but it would at least be easier to appreciate it on its own terms. The group's attempts at a more danceable sound on ""Good Evening"" and ""All Day"" are modestly successful and flatter Milberg's understated vocal style. Despite solid musicianship, however, their grooves are often rather limp, and many of their disco moves are only theoretically conducive to actual dancing. The album maintains a pleasing and mellow atmosphere, but the tone isn't very evocative. Whereas their earliest work brought to mind a surreal winter wonderland, this music seems oddly blank. It feels like being nowhere, and not in an interesting sort of way. The problem here isn't to do with craft-- these are reasonably okay compositions performed by a band of talented professionals-- but it could be a matter of passion and commitment. There's no sense of emotional stakes on the album, and there isn't any strong feeling to connect with either way. To some extent, WYWH can get by on vibe, but really, a listener can do much better, even without going further back into the Concretes catalog."
12326	9247	"That Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace label inked a distribution deal with Universal just in time to release Tam's self-titled, anthological debut seems like some kind of cosmic joke. While it isn't exactly lo-fi, it's far from polished-- and perhaps because Moore handpicked the songs from several demos, production value and style is highly erratic. Not to mention that out in the broad demographic, singers, perhaps unreasonably, are expected to be able to sing. In the strictest sense of the word, Tam can't: She treats key more like a suggestion than a rule. Flat stentorian vowels waver raucously between toothmarked consonants. It's no great stretch for the Silver Jews crowd, but to the John Mayer set, it's going to sound like Wesley Willis. Maybe Moore just liked the idea of horrified Borders patrons spewing breve foam onto listening stations.
    If Tam's raw divagations fairly shout ""outsider artist,"" this is illusory-- she's been a fixture on the Montreal music scene since the 1990s, playing in Django Reinhardt and Oasis cover bands as well as her own Vampires; she wrote some lyrics for and toured with the Unicorns; and she told the Montreal Mirror that she made Régine Butler jealous by jamming with Win (the accompanying photo of the singer in a saucily modified Department of Corrections uniform lends credibility to the claim). In fact, she covers the Arcade Fire's ""Nocarsgo"" on her album, and while she plays it in her usual bare-bones style, it's reverent and heartfelt, the refrain of ""Between the click of the light and the start of the dream"" blending seamlessly with the gnomic snippets she wrote herself. So Tam's no fringe crazy, just a pop fan with a pragmatic punk sensibility born of a combination of technical limitation and compositional acuity.
    Somewhere between Kurt Cobain and Exene Cervenka, Tam manages to evoke apathy, nihilism, and queasy romance at once, leavening her throttled lines with ridiculously catchy hooks. The garage rock stompers ""1000 Watts"" and ""Deadman Brings the Luck"" reveal how unexceptional Tam's music could be if she played it safe, dressing up her voice in the slacker-punk riffage it begs for, although the rock approach also produces one of the album's best songs, ""Incest at Best"". Over tooth-grinding guitars, Tam fully indulges her potential to sneer, and her lyrics glitter with the ecstasy of teenage depression: ""Incest at best/ It must have touched you somewhere/ We're so much less than friends."" But usually, she's better when she's exploring styles of music that suit her less obviously-- electro-pop, indie folk, digital psychedelia. Her gentler songs are especially effective because there's no timidity in her singing, but neither is there a sense of blustery caricature. She softens her burlap balloon of a voice with a counterintuitive tenderness, and it floats with endearing, awkward grace. On ""You're Not Mine"", we get a dreamy pulse, slide whistles, and aching vocals, striking a stark contrast to the brusque rock numbers. ""Top"" is depressive seether, darkly lagging and surging. ""Modern Man"" and ""Stop"" creak with damaged electronics, as Tam croaks winsomely amid the smoldering wreckage. Paradoxically, there's a daring nudity to these efforts that's absent from the superficially dangerous punk ones.

    There are at least two kinds of singing: the technically refined kind we admire because we can't do it, and the weirdly poignant kind that reminds us of all the things we could do, if we had the conviction to try. The latter, a manifestation of beauty predicated upon sheer force of will rather than talent, is where Tam excels. She uses rudimentary tools to carve homely artifacts that have the quiet dignity and durable utility of handmade carpentry. They may not be much to look at it, but with their emphasis of function over form, they're a pleasure to settle into.

17020	10	"ABCS are all about unity.  Their bandname comes from the first
    letters of their last names, and their album cover shows three
    slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow.  Their
    album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get.  By
    wielding sax (Gabe Andruzzi), drums (Josh Blair), and accordion (Pete
    Cafarella), ABCS deftly flaunt their skills by dealing in abrupt time
    changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo,
    duet and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of any
    obvious rock context.

    The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies
    on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation.  An accordion
    is yanked out of its usual Germanic setting and thrust into a punk
    rock Terry Riley/Phil Glass jam that references polka, ska, and Pauline
    Oliveros.  The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz
    context and occasionally adds breathy, ambient elements, is constantly
    yelling across the room at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid
    retorts.

    This album is the ABCS' debut release, and it shines with all the
    enthusiasm of anything new.  It starts on an up note, kicking through
    the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole
    fucking mess grinds to a halt.  It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very
    fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a variety of styles and
    philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them.

    And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: transition.
    The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various
    modes while remaining on all the time.  These guys benefit from the
    same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable.  And because
    they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly with
    each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their
    tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1."
13020	3493	"Gogogo Airheart have played for 13 years, but never to the same ecstatic reception as Futureheads or Franz Ferdinand. Once upon a time, those bands supported Airheart on tour; now the Sunderland and Glasgow acts are crossing over while the San Diego band quietly releases Record No. 6. Forgive the apples and pears, but Airheart, like Franz and Futureheads, make trendy, canon-mashing rock. So where's the viability? Great singles help, great albums clinch, but Gogogo Airheart never got past step one: applying the polish.On Rats! Sing! Sing!, the band nail a losing formula, blending familiar sounds-- bratty discopunk, brooding college rock, white boy dub-- without the usual giveaways. Four-on-the-floor foundations, for instance, are tapped out on big, untreated drums, not the tamped-down 70s cans purveyed by James Murphy or Kudu. Even the most rigid numbers are permitted a sly swing, whether by sloven (""So Good"") or double-drummed funk (""Double Bummer""). Trebly guitars don't ill-become any of these songs, but Airheart's are particularly crispy; for a truly face-singeing experience, see ""Lie With a Lamb"" or ""Shake It Off"", whose rollicking, sun-baked guitar solo would make fellow So-Cal'er Stephen Malkmus proud.It's actually rarer for bands to buck trend at this superficial end of the spectrum, especially when they make a conscious effort of it. Few begrudge pushing contrivance upon written material, but when it comes to aesthetics, the protocol is more restrictive. Rats! Sing! Sing!'s casual variety calls for a less specific stylization, but rather than hybridize Gogogo Airheart treat each song individually, which begets a number of interesting choices, some more successful than others.From piecemeal opener ""Rats"" the band extracts a Walkmen-ish scraggliness with sprinklings of wet piano and radio oscillations. Success! Walls of murky amplified sound vex ""Burn It Down""'s straightforward surf-rock. Cool! But ""Heart on a Chain"" is stripped down to the point of having a one-off feel; the song seems to want to shake its breezy torpor and make a charge but it's foiled by a fade out. Arbitrary? From here down the record's backstretch the band stop making curious decisions confidently and quit deciding altogether. Grooves dissipate, vocals flop around in echo, riffs take a rain check. Like Jason Blake on a wraparound, Gogogo Airheart just can't finish. Only no one's blocking their net; the problem seems one of commitment."
13232	8809	"Craig Wedren and Team Love? Dubious. The label's feel-good aura seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured Craig Wedren we know from the glammed-up D.C. post-punk of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around lyrics like ""A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"" fit in with the Willy Masons of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the teen-angst alt-folk pie?

    Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. punk scene, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most unique music. After releasing several terrific records of haunting, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer Adam Wade and the inimitable guitarist Nathan Larson, signed with Epic, and released the career-defining Pony Express Record. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and Wedren's voice was exquisite, sliding frictionlessly between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest his elliptical poems with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated 50,000 B.C. didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores away from dissolution.

    Wedren's kept busy messing around with his arty pop band Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since Lapland features songs that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off film contributions, it's the Wedren project that most obviously begs for comparison to his old band. Make no mistake-- Lapland is a mainstream pop record; ""One Man's Heart"" and ""Do You Wrong"" were co-written with Jimmy Harry, who's penned songs for Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. Even with the poppier, more accessible turn Shudder to Think took with 50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these charming but strictly MOR pop ditties.

    So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The good news is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, Wedren's voice sounds terrific, an expressive and formidable instrument. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains striking. If most of the tunes on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as incidental music for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of ""Do You Harm"", for instance, and the various times on songs like ""Wanna Drive?"" and ""Fifteen Minutes Late"" when Wedren's voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, chilly upper regions of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for its unapologetic softening, and new Wedren fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop. "
6501	15580	"If all political rappers were a little more like Killer Mike, political rap might not be so irritating. While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, Killer Mike comes across as a smart man with a short fuse. The hulking Atlanta rapper entered the game as Big Boi's bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like ""Snappin' & Trappin'"" and ""The Whole World"". But after a few years in major-label limbo and a messy split with Big Boi, Mike emerged as something else: a righteous underground-rap avenger, a live wire with a moral compass and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent ""That's Life"", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: ""[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."" That one song was a more effective rage-trigger than anything John Goodman roared into his webcam during season one of ""Treme"". But Mike's political fury never quite dominates his rapping; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about economic inequality. Paradoxically, that gives his political stuff more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style.With every album these days, Mike sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a major-league rap star. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who presumably aren't knocking down his door anyway: ""If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: T.I. and Gucci Mane, unable to stay out of jail, and Young Jeezy, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly under the radar, a fiery old-school Southern rap record with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any radio station on Earth.The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and stormy soul samples. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on ""Ready Set Go"", or the dazed Flying Lotus collaboration ""Swimming"". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together beautifully, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, Mike emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of Oscar Grant and airing out some reservations in Obama: ""We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against their own economic interests, caving to the manipulation of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some lurid street-level threats, he delivers: ""Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.""As Mike's persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the audience he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of his best-loved recent songs, ""That's Life"" and ""God in the Building"". And a remix to ""Ready Set Go"" even gives Mike's audience the feel-good reunion with Big Boi that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, Mike is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from ""That's Life II"", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But Palin and Pelosi both gon' have you broke as shit""), or Mike's decision to share the spotlight with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on ""Ric Flair"". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a sturdy platform for one of rap's fiercest and most incisive voices, and it achieves that goal completely."
17203	2228	"""The gift of memory is an awful curse.""
    --Ben Gibbard, ""Stability""
    Aside from being a rather nice turn of phrase, this line from the title track
    of Death Cab for Cutie's new EP strikes me as oddly universal.  That's not to
    say it applies to all people or memories, but it does bring up an interesting
    point, especially with regard to music.  Given that music is a time-based art
    form, relying on the passage of minutes and seconds (or sometimes hours) to
    make its impact and relay its message, I sometimes get to thinking about what
    it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory.
    I'm pretty sure I first had this thought while exiting the theater after a
    showing of Memento.  For those of you who haven't seen the film, it
    centers around a man who, after being attacked, loses the ability to form
    short-term memories.  Without those memories, attachments become difficult to
    form, and his life begins to lose meaning altogether.  It's actually quite a
    terrifying concept.
    Transposing this to music, think about how it would change the way you listened
    to things.  First, you'd have no frame of reference for what you were listening
    to-- it would essentially be pure sound.  Secondly, if your frame of memory were
    extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically
    meaningless.  In the West, music relies so heavily on repetition to be successful
    that I think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare
    without that benefit.  I've often thought that I'd love to experience music from
    that standpoint for just one day, if only to gain a fresh perspective.
    Of course, this isn't what Gibbard is getting at.  Rather, he's referring in
    somewhat abstract terms to those little nagging memories that we can't seem to
    make disappear, no matter how hard we try.  This is often his topic of choice for
    lyrics, but don't think for a second that this is a typical Death Cab for Cutie
    release.   With these two originals and one Björk cover, we find the Bellingham,
    Washington-based quartet exploring musical directions they've never fully headed
    in before, though listening back through their other records, you can find hints
    of this direction if you know what you're looking for.
    The EP opens with ""20th Century Towers,"" a wasted, incredibly slow song that
    hangs on the barest of rhythmic frameworks.  ""I know the conscious choice was
    crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your
    ear/ And tied these arms around you,"" sings Gibbard over Nick Harmer's swelling
    bassline, minimal guitar parts and somnambulant drums.  The song's strange climax
    comes after Gibbard sings the line, ""Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've
    wasted what little he gave me,"" when the entire band joins to sing only two words--
    ""All around""-- in harmony.  The guitars become steadily more active after this
    point, with Gibbard and Chris Walla each playing a part on separate channels,
    making for an interesting stereo effect.
    Strangely, the band's cover of Björk's ""All Is Full of Love"" is both the most
    typical-sounding and the most propulsive of Stability's three tracks.
    Drummer Michael Schorr lays down a distinctive beat, mostly on his toms,
    immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original.
    Gibbard handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too surprising, seeing
    as he and Björk sing in almost the same range.  It certainly does not better
    the original, but I suspect it would at least work well in the car.  Overall,
    it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to
    the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note.
    And then there's the 13-minute long title track.  The first few minutes are
    affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with ""20th Century
    Towers.""  The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell
    more quickly.  Gibbard is joined by John Vanderslice, who sings backup on most of
    the song's vocal section.  After the verses end, the song continues for nine
    minutes, with the apparition of Gibbard singing far in the background, and
    Walla's guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass.  Vanderslice
    contributes some synth textures which help things bit, but in the end, this seems
    like one case where a lack of musical memory might be a good thing.  That way,
    you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is.
    The main problem is that the band doesn't really do anything interesting in that
    nine-minute span.  There's no buildup of tension or subsequent release, and
    Vanderslice can only offer so much variation with his sustained synth chords and
    volume swells.  If nothing else, I suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia.
    At any rate, it just sort of peters out at the end, keeping the EP from feeling
    like a fully realized statement.
    For those new to the Death Cab for Cutie camp, I'd say We Have the Facts and
    Are Voting Yes still stands as the best entry point, but the true fans might
    be into this new disc.  It shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to
    see, and only briefly at that.  Some fans may actually own it already, if they
    happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last year's The
    Photo Album or the Japanese import version of that album.  For those who
    don't, Stability reveals a promising new dimension to Death Cab's sound
    that, in non-epic doses, could do wonders for their future releases."
10680	10948	"With its emphasis on slacker attitude and anything-goes energy over ambition and technical polish, indie rock is the consummate entry-level genre. It's the musical equivalent of a pick-up-and-play Wii game compared to, say, techno's steeply learning-curved Xbox 360 shooter. As such, musicians who began their careers as catch-all indie rockers before narrowing their focus to more technically and conceptually challenging genres are a dime a dozen.Fog's Andrew Broder is much rarer: His trajectory inverts the familiar one. Fog's first two LPs were released on Ninja Tune, but they were steeped in the Anticon aesthetic (fittingly, Doseone brought Fog to Ninja Tune's attention)-- an obscure haze of post-Prince-Paul sample wizardry ballasted with baubles of melody and avant-hop guest stars, generously laced with rhythmic decomposition and seething negative space. The delicate Ether Teeth gave us Fog at its most challenging and rewarding-- it was an uncompromising attempt to build music that towered, teetered, but didn't move.For listeners bored by artful stasis, the relatively straightforward electro-pop of 2005's 10th Avenue Freakout (which featured discernible structures and more of Broder's vocals than ever before) must've seemed like a step in the right direction. But for those who admired the imperfect yet promising Ether Teeth, it was the first step in a regression that culminates in the unabashed indie-rock of Ditherer. There's nothing wrong with the urge to try on more traditional garb, but while Broder is an adequate frontman, it's not his best look, and Ditherer makes the previously outré musician sound mundane. He's in the habit of mercilessly stretching his syllables over the tricked-out riffs, which is a good cheat to make awkward lines fit into consistent structures, but quickly becomes monotonous. And in this context, his ridiculous lyrics have more in common with the dopey pretensions of Primus than Bob Pollard's absurdist Zen.For Ditherer, Broder coalesced Fog into a rock trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals, Mark Erickson on bass, and Tim Glenn on drums. As if making up for lost time, the album finds Fog stitching together a hodgepodge of rock styles into a quilt of clashing colors. ""We Will Have Vanished"" is ponderous, enervating stoner rock. ""Inflatable Ape Pt. 3"" is indebted to Pavement, with its stabby guitars and nervous drums. The roots-rock-gone-wild of ""I Have Been Wronged"" tangles up a percolating guitar figure with forlorn hound-dog vocals, zippy prog trills, and a lounge-y breakdown. ""Hallelujah Daddy"" is off-kilter Southern rock, and the spacious, eerie ""What Gives?"" (which features Microphones' Phil Elvrum on backing vocals) reminds us that it's hard to understate how crucial Thom Yorke's otherworldly voice is to Radiohead's success.Broder is better at details than broad strokes, and Ditherer contains some excellent ones; they're just buried in the piecemeal and decidedly indelicate songwriting. ""Hallelujah Daddy"", which features a guest appearance from Why?, comes to life in its gospel-rock middle section. The dubby title track (dubby is good for Broder; it plays into his strengths) profits greatly from Dosh's sprightly electro embellishments and Andrew Bird's weepy violin, while ""What's Up Freaks?"" offers a welcome respite from Broder's voice with a guest spot by Low's Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk. It's easy to admire the careful studio touches that pop up in almost every song-- the helium-deflating breakdown of ""We Will Have Vanished"", the telegraphic percussive blips and vocal strobes of ""You Did What You Thought"", and the bending sheet-metal on post-rock epic ""On the Gallows"". But it's hard to enjoy them without bogging down in been-there, done-that songwriting."
5922	16127	"When Bristol legend Pinch released the out-of-nowhere ""Croydon House"" in 2010-- on the London-based Swamp81 instead of his own foundational Tectonic imprint-- it felt like a sea change. One of dubstep's most influential pioneers, one of its diehard careerists, had made his own version of a house record (and this was before 2011 when it became the norm). In keeping with his usual heads-down dubstep, however, ""Croydon House"" was murky, dim-lit, and paranoid, not your standard garage-influenced thumper, and his tracks since have seen him navigate a no man's land of in-between tempos and experimental rhythms, culminating in the bewildering Pinch and Shackleton collaborative album at the end of last year. It goes beyond just productions: This summer, Pinch started incorporating house into his DJ sets, dedicating sections of his timeslots to the 4/4 stuff. Was he moving on from dubstep?It's this many-limbed and flailing, vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland that Rob Ellis' long-overdue entry in the Fabriclive mix series occupies: The drums still swing and shake with that tribal energy that marks his best dubstep work, but there's not always the snare on the third, and sometimes there's a four-to-the-floor kick. The mix begins mid-track and cleverly continues the conceptual current that's been running through commercial mix CDs as of late: think Four Tet's own Fabriclive go for a similar example of artiness run amok in a dance mix. The nervily pulsating throb of Atlanta producer Distal's ""Venom"" both opens and closes the set, sealing it into a closed circle that, at least in its peripheries, raises questions about the linearity of mixes in the first place. There's an obvious left-to-right motion here, but there's no grand closer, pensive opener, or any real climax: Left to its own devices, Pinch's mix never really ends, the same bumpy journey over and over again, bubbling and bubbling but refusing to boil over. Does it need to end for it to be a satisfying product? According to Pinch, apparently not.This little tweak allows Ellis to play around with the sequencing, and Fabriclive 61 begins with a gallop, running through a surprisingly techno-tinged opening stretch, with French producer F's overlooked (and hugely inventive) ""Slow Down"" colliding with Shed's latest in his rave-techno EQD alias: it's an almost confrontational greeting from someone once associated with the purest of dubstep, and a true sign of the times for both the genre and one of its most prominent heroes.  The mix continues in this vein before fading out into beatless-near silence with Roly Porter's gorgeous mechano-classical ""Hessra""-- at which point Pinch's remix of Photek's ""Acid Reign"" storms out, bringing the mix into more familiar 140-bpm dubstep territory.Where some recent dubstep mixes like Youngsta's Rinse CD or Distance's Dubstep Allstars Vol. 8 were fine showcases of the genre's steadfast traditionalist communities, they were nevertheless tainted by the genre's turn inward (or the formulaic). Pinch's selection of pounding kicks, crash-landing snares, and LFO growls, however, sound both more vital and crucially more alien(ating) than ever. His choice of producers is impeccable, mixing in old stalwarts who are at career highs (Distance's sound is as mean as its ever been, and Goth-Trad's lost in some LSD rabbithole) and producers like Roska and Addison Groove who provide strange, unconventional takes on the median dubstep tempo. It's the most exciting 30 minutes of relatively pure ""dubstep"" since Appleblim's career-defining Dubstep Allstars Vol. 6, taking that staggered ""dungeon sound"" and infusing it with all the psychological paranoia and jagged, jigsaw-puzzle rhythms that defined his own best work, both dubstep and otherwise.So how do we get from dubstep back to whatever Distal's ""Venom"" is supposed to be? Ellis one-ups the ""Hessra"" play, dropping the loping limp of Illum Sphere's ""Promise a Secret""-- a tightknit blend of hyper-compressed string samples that's eventually gutted by Distal's more assertive track-- on top of Om Unit's jerky ""Pressure"". Which brings us right back to where we started, traversing the most current iterations of the bass music continuum as viewed through Pinch's dusty, obsidian lens.What makes the halving between tempos less jarring is Pinch's distinct aesthetic: the music here is damaged, blackened, and always foreboding, no matter what tempo it's pounding at or what genre it might be interrogating. That unrelenting blackness can be suffocating, and it's definitely unfriendly, but it's never boring-- which is a lot more than you can say about most ""dubstep"" mixes these days. So while Pinch might not have moved on from dubstep completely, he's definitely moved somewhere, and it sounds like an exciting place to be."
2863	19509	"When it comes to heavy music, niche politics exercise a disproportionately powerful role in shaping a band’s musical identity. There's an obsession with compartmentalizing every last guitar lick or drum beat and planning the listening experience accordingly, almost as if by algorithm. This approach offers an easy way to establish distinctions between artists, but it comes at the expense of a reduced appreciation of metal's liminal spaces and atypical arrangements. Case in point: Brooklyn's visionaries of filth Mutilation Rites. However strong the Darkthrone worship may have shone through on Empyrean, the band's excellent 2012 debut, their blackened riffs were ultimately overshadowed by their rabid, punkish attitude, unpredictable percussion, and cross-pollinating song-craft. Two years later, Mutilation Rites return with Harbinger, their second album. Like its predecessor, the new record splits its time between lengthy, metamorphosing epics and thunderous rabble-rousers, with nary a synth or sample in sight. This time around, however, improved sonics and sharpened songwriting streamline the band's venture into the void, recalling a garagey Gorgoroth at some points and a filthier Converge at others. Frequently, their smoke-enshrouded roar resonates with a sneaky immediacy reminiscent of early Mastodon; with its unstoppable guitar hook and seething, grunge-y coda, “Contaminate” is easily Mutilation Rites' “Blood and Thunder”, while closing dirge “Tactical Means of Ouroboros” would have felt right at home on Remission. Like the Atlanta legends, the quartet exercise mind and muscle equally, striking a difficult balance between galloping polyrhythms and beefy guitars on opener “Black Pyramid”. At the same time, they don't stick around to stargaze for too long; where there's a mournful melodic seep (as on “Exhaling and Breathing In”), a shuddering screech from vocalist George Paul never trails far behind.Harbringer’s gut-lurching thrills rely heavily on drummer Justin Ennis, formerly of fellow Brooklynites Tombs. Guided by some arcane intuition, he carves out the violent spaces where the band wreaks havoc and detonates them as he sees fit. On “Suffer the Children”, his kit ricochets between black, death, d-beat, doom, and grindcore temples, repeatedly threatening the track's inevitable collapse across six pulverizing minutes. As the blast-beats bear down on the second half, the song’s kinetic force strengthens in a caustic crescendo that defies logic, endowing the din with unexpected depth. It's a bit of percussive wizardry on the part of engineer Kevin Bernsten, best known for his work with speed demons like Magrudergrind. Snare, cymbal, and bass each carry twice as much weight in his mix, making Ennis’ fills—rather than the riffs of Paul and Michael Dimmitt—the focal points of songs like ""Contaminate” and “Gravitational Collapse”. In spite of their motions towards transcendence, Mutilation Rites’ complex racket is never accompanied by an elitist aftertaste. Considering their associations with the notoriously overachieving Brooklyn metal scene, that’s both a relief and a blessing—freedom to enjoy the adrenaline rush of Harbinger without getting bogged down by form or philosophy, the sound of four guys paying tribute to chaos the best way they know how. "
15982	4912	"Consider the sine wave. It's the purest tone possible, a smooth wave without overtones.  A sine wave, if
    reproduced properly, sounds exactly the same as another sine wave at the same frequency. Perhaps because
    few sounds in nature are true sine waves (some insects come close), we associate sine waves with machines.
    Ryoji Ikeda builds much of his music from sine waves, and the tone of his music reflects an abstract,
    mechanized and mathematical world. Ikeda has made some mind-blowing music that, to me, doesn't sound
    particularly human. It's music that seems pulled from some philosophical plane and injected directly into
    my brain.

    But Ikeda's ideas are only part of the sine wave story. I wonder if-- for American kids, at least-- a
    lifetime of exposure to the emergency broadcast system tests hasn't given sine waves a twinge of humanizing
    nostalgia. I remember tests while Electric Company played, and I remembered the real thing when a
    tornado would touch down in the area. I hear sine waves now and it triggers vague memories of being huddled
    with my family in a damp basement with the radio on, hearing the branches rattling against the house as the
    wind whipped outside: ""Bzzzzz. This is the Emergency Broadcast System... a tornado warning is in effect
    for..."" The familiar EBS tone was not actually a sine wave; the combination of two tones, 853 Hz and 960
    Hz, gave the sound a slightly grating edge meant to signal ""danger."" But it was close, and it was the kind
    of thing you paid attention to when you were a kid. The EBS tone, though ostensibly a warning, had a certain
    comfort to it.

    On Computer Recital, Lullatone has found a way to take sine waves and arrange them into soft, gentle
    little lullabies, and I can't help but wonder if Shawn Seymour (Lullatone's driving force) feels a similar
    sense of nostalgia.  This is music that instantly seems connected to pleasant childhood memories.  Lullatone
    gets some of his warmth from the sine waves by not being a purist.  While he makes regular use of clean
    tones, he mixes them with tones enriched with a dollop of harmonic distortion, in addition to tossing in
    some other instruments occasionally. So you get some organ, little hints of percussion, and even a subtle
    vocal.

    Lullatone's melodies are the repetitive and sequenced sort that minimalist composers added to music's
    vocabulary, and though tracks are easy enough to tell apart, the mood from one to the next varies little.
    Computer Recital is a calm, clean, reflective musical space that seems intimately connected with
    sounds coming from Japan, despite Lullatone's home base in Louisville. More than any single record, Computer
    Recital reminds me of the patient, measured melodicism of Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko's
    solo album Ongakushitsu.  It definitely sounds like something that could have come out on Childisc
    (witness titles like ""Coloring"" and ""Plastic Toy Record Player""), and, deepening the connection, Lullatone's
    only other release is a split-single with Takemura alias Child's View.

    Even with these obvious inspirations, Lullatone doesn't seem derivative-- or, more accurately, the fact that
    it may be derivative doesn't much matter.  There's something in Computer Recital's single-minded
    pursuit of simple beauty that personalizes the record. Everything about it radiates smallness and intimacy;
    it's intended for one-on-one communication, and hence, consideration of outside references seems unimportant
    and possibly even intrusive. The only requirements for enjoying Computer Recital are ears and the
    ability to daydream."
994	21738	"The path is so well charted that it's practically a ritual. Young artist creates track; track becomes hit; hit becomes phenomenon, artist becomes famous. The track is undeniable and thus, ubiquitous. Your parents are aware of it. Fans start to hate it, though nowhere close to as much as the artist does. And then, when the artist goes ahead and decides to make new music, everything he does, from the promotion to the concerts, looks like a Sisyphean attempt to escape its shadow.The Brooklyn producer Baauer is observing the rites. He has called his Billboard-topping, YouTube-dominating 2013 craze ""Harlem Shake"" ""corny and annoying as fuck"" and his new album Aa represents his ""defiant"" new beginning. For Baauer, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that he had less to do with his own song's rise than strangers on the Internet. They were the ones who performed the alchemy that changed it from a jam, to an Essential Mix standout to a viral soundtrack. ""I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it's like my weird, fucked-up adopted teenage kid coming back to me,"" he said at the time.Sometimes, talented career artists become one-hit wonders (Carly Rae Jepsen) and sometimes, clowns who have stumbled upon, or stolen, something infectious do the same (Vanilla Ice.) The experience can be particularly difficult for an artist like Baauer, a raw, young musician with interesting ideas who has yet to fully develop. Following ""Harlem Shake,"" Aa might feel to some like an undercooked, scattershot album, experimental to its own detriment. But if Baauer were an unknown musician —which, artistically speaking, he still essentially is — it'd be a rimshot of a debut, crackling with energy and humor, well-paced, with no dud tracks and more than a few infectious ones.Aa is devoted to the block-party spirit of hip-hop, in keeping with most of Baauer's work, and at a time when various genres of electronic music are downplaying the black sources of their sound, it's refreshingly willing to share both its influences and the limelight. Many of the tracks in its adrenaline-spiked back half are dominated by other artists, as Baauer took advantage of the connections afforded him by ""Harlem Shake"" to collaborate with M.I.A., Pusha T, Future and Rustie. Their appearances aren't wasted. Features function like power-ups on Aa, allowing the album to ascend in excitement, leveling up to an almighty peak. (Baauer's clear love of collaboration and respect for the sounds he incorporates might also serve as a balm to those who were irritated by the way that the mainstream ""Harlem Shake"" dance craze completely ignored the original, Cam'ron-approved dance.)The album's melting pot feel is consistent with that of Baauer's less-famous releases, the EPs Dum Dum (2012) and ß (2014). His methodology is consistent: He excavates the undergirdings of genres like hip-hop, R&B and dancehall, and swaps in a new foundation, often composed of wobbling, thundering bass. After a couple of exploratory warning shots at the outset of Aa — the Rustie-inspired opener, ""Church,"" the drum n' bass n' trap banger ""GoGo!"" — the album settles into a groove on the explosive R&B of ""Body,"" its first inescapable track, which splits the difference between the producer's past work with AlunaGeorge and the soiled romanticism of electronic artists like Giraffage.From there, it's a steady climb with stops along the way in Discovery-era Daft Punk soundalike (""Pinku"") and peace councils between back-alley grime and Bonecrusher-style mob music. (""Day Ones."") On songs like these, Baauer demonstrates his ability to identify and recontextualize bite-size melodic candy, and ""Harlem Shake's"" rise starts to look less like an Internet accident and more like inevitability. Check out the way he plays the Tetris theme song into the back end of ""Sow."" It's a goofy, addictive gimmick that loses none of its melodic power for being so.In the tradition of many of the best electronic releases of the decade, Aa is a collage. But its patchwork of influences isn't a way for the producer to avoid pressure. Instead, Baauer and the other artists meet the heavyweight expectations head-on. ""Temple,"" the M.I.A. feature here, is vintage Mathangi: She sounds as fresh and London-cocky as she did on Arular. And ""Kung Fu"" doesn't dare to waste Pusha T or Future. Pusha and Future have two of the most iconic voices in contemporary hip-hop, and Baauer clearly understands the appeal of placing them as foils on the same track, the brick-hard snarl and the ecstatic lament.If you want a file to show up at the top of an alphabetically-organized folder, you can throw a bunch of A's at the front of its name, and ensure that it will be there. But as much as Baauer may want Aa to define a new beginning, to crowd out everything else he's done so far, there's no easy way for him to erase ""Harlem Shake."" He's doomed to be evaluated in the context of what will likely represent the peak of a certain kind of career success. The best he can do is what he's done here: rectify the wrongs of the craze that the track spawned while building on what it did right. Take advantage of the opportunities it's granted, throw an album-length party and encourage the dancers to come correct."
744	21944	Cover songs have long been a crucial part of Mark Kozelek’s work. In the days of Red House Painters, Kozelek recorded devastating interpretations of songs by Kiss, Paul McCartney, and even Francis Scott Key to prove just how widely applicable his brand of melancholy was. His selection of covers—often picked straight from the classic-rock songbook—drew a clear line from his sepia-toned shoegaze to golden-era '70s radio, culminating in his curation of a John Denver tribute album at the turn of the millennium and his ensuing move toward more straight-ahead singer-songwriter material under the Sun Kil Moon moniker. In the first decade of the '00s, as Kozelek’s music found him less focussed on emotional extremes and more on the gray areas in between, he recorded subtle, gorgeous versions of songs by contemporaries like Low, Will Oldham, and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. Up until his recent turn toward diaristic, autobiographical songwriting, these covers were some of his most revealing work: songs that felt as much a part of his legacy as any he had written.In that sense, Kozelek’s latest collection of covers, Mark Kozelek Sings Favorites is his most classically Kozelekian release since 2010’s Admiral Fell Promises, the solo guitar mood piece that served as the finale for one season of his career, before 2012’s Among the Leaves ushered in a prolific era of controversies and absurdly big lyric sheets. Like Admiral Fell Promises, Mark Kozelek Sings Favorites features some material that will be familiar to longtime followers. Tracks like Bob Seger’s “Mainstreet” and the traditional folk song “Get Along Home Cindy” have appeared in his live sets for years. Meanwhile, a superior rendition of “Send in the Clowns” first showed up on his 2008 odds-and-ends collection The Finally LP, and “Float On” marks the twelfth Modest Mouse cover Kozelek has put to tape. As such, the title of this collection feels as much a means of drawing a tenuous thematic link between the material as it is a way of admitting, “These are just some songs that Mark Kozelek already knew the words to.” As with the previous release in this series (Sings Christmas Carols), you will probably know whether or not you want to hear it based on the title alone.Still, it’s 2016 and it wouldn’t be a new Kozelek release without a few surprises. The most obvious change here is the fact that the sole accompaniment on the album is piano, an instrument used sparingly but effectively throughout his work. And while these performances are a far cry from, say, “Shadows”—the stirring piano ballad highlight from 1995’s Ocean Beach—Favorites has a few fine moments. “Float On,” a song whose tragic afterlife has found it Kidz Bopped and even worse, finally gets a rendition it deserves. Stripped of its iconic guitar hook, Kozelek’s rendition places the focus on the complex vocal climax at the end, made even more powerful by the understated piano part. Elsewhere, in a loving rendition of David Bowie’s “Win,” Chris Connolly's piano is the perfect accompaniment, alternating between jazzy, downtempo verses and bold choruses. Other songs lack these dynamics, like the pleasant but unimaginative redos of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” Roy Harper's “Another Day,” and the aforementioned Seger cover. Although the latter’s lyrics are a perfect fit for Kozelek’s recent turn toward rambling recollection, the performance feels characterless. While the best of Kozelek’s cover songs found him refitting the songs to suit his particular guitar tunings and vocal style, the arrangements here are mostly identical to their originals. Who would have listened to his AC/DC covers album if he had just strummed power chords and hummed along? On Favorites, it’s as if Kozelek just wandered into a piano bar, handed over a stack of sheet music, and hit record.At its best, the casual atmosphere makes for one of Kozelek’s loosest, lightest collections to date: something to throw on when you don’t have the emotional capacity for his more distinctive albums. And while Kozelek’s weary, grumbly voice has helped to give a sense of depraved intensity to his last few releases, it sounds prettier here than it has in a while, thanks in part to the inherent melodicism of the songs he picked for the project. Still, for an artist whose cover songs used to reveal multitudes about the performer, Favorites mostly feels self-serving. Maybe that’s why he chose to start the set off with “Send in the Clowns,” a wry song of wasted love and regret. Coming from a 49-year-old guy who, with every new release, seems increasingly uninterested in pleasing anyone but himself, it also plays as a sort of non-apology. “My fault, I fear,” Kozelek sings, “I thought that you wanted what I wanted—sorry my dear.” What follows is a collection of songs that is unlikely to become anybody’s favorite: just more proof that Mark Kozelek Sings Whatever the Hell He Wants.
8131	13940	"Though three-fourths of the members of Past Lives are from the scorched-earth screamo/punk-metal Blood Brothers, there's nothing on the group's debut LP that offers a hint to their background. The EP that preceded it, Strange Symmetry, had some more cathartic moments-- as well as singer Jordan Blilie's hoarse, tantrum-in-the-toy-aisle screaming-- but Tapestry of Webs is a clean break from the past.Say what you will about their former band, but by the end of their career, Blood Brothers were anything but one-note. That they've changed gears isn't necessarily a surprise; that they stay in one gear and explore its possibilities is, however. Where the Blood Brothers were a study in extremes, this band and album are marked by quiet tension and gradual builds. The instrumentation has changed as well-- trumpets and woodwinds pop up on several tracks.The group has clearly reconsidered its approach, but nowhere is it more apparent than with the Blilie's singing. Only in the most frayed and frantic moments of songs like ""K Hole"" or ""Hospital White"" does he approach the screech of his other projects. Instead he sings on a low, stable register throughout, reaching for actual notes-- and if you've never heard his earlier projects, his voice might take a little getting used to.For those who are familiar with Blilie, part of what makes this record interesting is hearing his voice in a new context and how he adapts to it. The same extends to the rest of the band: Sometimes the group's subtlety builds into a soaring and assured melody, as it does in ""Paralyzer"" or the near-strut of ""Vanishing Twin"". There's often a tangible tension, as with ""Past Lives"", which grows progressively more ominous without ever offering release, or melodic, dub-inflected ""Deep in the Valley"" and ""Aerosol Bouquet"". Occasionally the band falls into a stilted and somewhat awkward lurch, like on the riff of ""Don't Let the Ashes Fill Your Eyes"", though even that has a striking and strangely lush chorus with layered vocal harmonies.The group does retain a raw, live in-the-room sound and feel, but above all the debut feels like a more ""mature"" record-- without any of the boring connotations the word ""mature"" usually implies when talking about career growth. After most of their peers have fallen by the wayside or have lost themselves to indulgence (looking at you, former members of At the Drive-In), Tapestry of Webs is an encouraging, welcome surprise-- a clear sign that the musicians involved are pushing themselves and searching for something new."
6840	15238	"In five seasons on Adult Swim and a handful of specials and live concert tours, ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" has established itself as one of the most aggressively strange programs in the history of television as well as one of the finest sources for oddball novelty music. Among the show's musical highlights include the cheeseball rock tunes of Pusswhip Banggang, the alarmingly cheerful ""All the Food Is Poison"", Frank Stallone singing ""we're turning your bedroom back into the computer room"" to a befuddled little girl, and the entire ouvre of the hapless duo Casey and His Brother. In all of these songs, Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, and their composer Davin Wood display a jingle writer's knack for melody, packing absurd humor into compact, ruthlessly effective hooks.Starting From Nowhere, an album of new music by Heidecker and Wood, takes their musical collaboration in a different direction. Heidecker's deep fascination with tacky 1970s and 80s aesthetics is foregrounded in a set of songs that strive to evoke the sound and feeling of vintage soft rock, but the comedy is dialed down considerably, to the point that many of the tracks barely register as comedy.For example, the opening track ""Cross Country Skiing"" is such a close approximation of earnest, gently harmonized folk pop that if it appeared on a new Fleet Foxes record, you would just take it as a given that Robin Pecknold enjoys winter sports. Other tracks are spot-on pastiches of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, Jackson Browne, and the Eagles. The lyrics are often ridiculous, but even the silliest moments could pass as sincere if you didn't know anything about Heidecker's comedy career. If there is a joke here, it's that this music sounds like what it sounds like.The thing is, all of the songs on Starting From Nowhere are written and executed with far too much precision and care to come off like a shallow mockery of soft rock. (Like, say, Yacht Rock.) Heidecker and Wood may be connoisseurs of kitsch, but they obviously love this music. The sophistication and detail on display here is rather stunning; you just can't arrive at pastiche with this kind of accuracy without genuine obsession.But without funny jokes, what exactly is the point of this album? Cut-out bins around the world overflow with music that sounds exactly like the contents of Starting From Nowhere. Indie bands such as Belle & Sebastian and Destroyer filter these sounds through the sensibilities of distinct, modern songwriters. Wood may nail the aesthetics of a particular era, but that high level of competency isn't the same thing as writing great songs. This is ultimately mediocre music that sometimes recalls the sound and feeling of excellent music, and the only thing that Heidecker brings to the table is a smirking irony that is not particularly appealing when separated from hilarious comedy. If you genuinely want to listen to this kind of music, you're better off with the real deal. (In particular, investigate Steely Dan's back catalog-- their slick, jazz-influenced rock has a darker, dryer wit than anything Heidecker can manage on this album.) If you want excellent novelty pop, cross your fingers for another season of ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"""
9067	12970	"Maybe you can chalk it up to their unique (awkward) name, but I'm still surprised Throw Me the Statue didn't earn more attention on the strength of their debut LP, Moonbeams. There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements really worked together, it did really seem destined for a thousand iPods Moonbeams was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest Throw Me the Statue came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was.Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the disappointing Purpleface EP. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""-- and roughly 16 minutes, Purpleface doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing Reitherman's budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the bummed-out balladry that bogged down the last third of Moonbeams. When it comes down to it, it's a proximity issue: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers in a row for something this slight.Swarming guitars, windowpane-splatter drums, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener ""That's How You Win"" from its own slightness, but the other three tracks here are as tender and troubled-sounding as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of ""Heart Signs"" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare acoustic plucking of the original with a heavy glaze of orchestration, and the song lives on to tug at another set of heartstrings. ""Honeybee"" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, gorgeous instrumental interlude and raspy Reitherman's best vocal performance on wax since Moonbeams' title track. There's a deliberateness to ""Honeybee"" that's lacking in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the least adorned track here: There's no need to dress up an already affecting tune. Clattering closer ""Ship"" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the performances feel weirdly dispassionate, as if Reitherman and company were treating this like a placeholder EP.And so it is, I suppose. But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think Reitherman's way with the pen is second only to his way around sculpture; he's done some good lyrics in the past, but he certainly didn't dogear anything particularly interesting for Purpleface. Reitherman's got a reasonably nonchalant singing voice, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with his lyrics, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"" is actually a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of Vanessa Carlton, and not the Vancessa Carlton song I like. ""Honeybee"" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when Reitherman's voice seems slightly obscured by the music and his own casualness. ""That's How You Win"" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without any discernible thread behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s Up or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, ""Ship"" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than Reitherman takes to say it. Some of those Moonbeams lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue ""Young Sensualists"" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this impressionistic tack sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to better tunes. "
10060	11514	"""I'm so cool, man,"" Naledge says on ""Mr. Alladatshit"". It's true, and it bodes poorly for hacks like me, because at this point Kidz in the Hall-- an Ivy League-educated underground rap group signed to Buckshot's label-- have generated such a strong buzz that they're pretty much set. They did it through a slew of celebrity collaborations and a hilarious video, ""Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"", which has gotten much-deserved TRL airplay. The album-closing remix of the song featuring Pusha T, Bun B, and the Cool Kids is quite good as well, and the version floating around produced by and featuring El-P is even better.
    Fine. But this is not a great backpack hip-hop album. Everyone complains about Naledge's shortcomings as an MC, but more unfortunate is his lyrical aversion to clever turns of phrase. There's nothing here as half as imaginative or witty as ""Cappuccino"", the breakout track from L.A. rappers the Knux, a duo often compared to the Kidz. As Peter Macia noted in his spot-on Pitchfork review of the guys' last record, School Was My Hustle: ""There's little evidence that school was actually their hustle."" And indeed the album's lyrical anemia is all the more surprising considering their Penn degrees.
    The cringe-worthy lines could fill a whole song: ""Ride tracks sort of like a NASCAR"" (from ""Paper Trail""); ""My car like a Shop Rite, got cheese, got bread, yeah yeah I shop right"" (from ""Drivin' Down the Block""); ""I think I love her, but I think I hate her at the very same time"" (from ""Love Hangover""). The beats are less urgent this time around as well. There's nothing that equals the power of Hustle tracks ""Ms. Juanita"", ""Wassup Jo'"", or ""Ritalin"". Double-O's tracks are breezy, nostalgic, and serviceable throughout, but don't stick in your head.
    ""In the spirit of Jimi, Rick James, and James Brown,"" Naledge announces at the beginning of ""Lucifer's Joyride"", but a more accurate characterization would be ""in the spirit of Gym Class Heroes,"" the current MTV Hits darlings who also play lip service to the greats but water their shit down with clumsy innuendo such as when Naledge encouraging us to ""get a little drunk, get a little naked. Let's go where the wind takes us."" (Are we in a boat?)
    ""Lucifer's Joyride"" has little Jimi, Rick, or James, but it does have just about everything else-- vocoder; allusions to drugs, gambling, and prostitution; a soul sample so drowned out you can barely hear it, and of course Gym Class Heroes' Travis McCoy, who is better at doing what he does than these guys are. With their frantic, rushed rhymes, and beats which are a bit too eager to please, the Kidz may be popular. But if they want to any cred they're going to have to learn to be themselves."
17424	3203	"Though I'm not sure if these songs were recorded for a scrapped movie project,
    it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that Tim Burton employed Friends of Dean
    Martinez to write the soundtrack for some failed attempt at a spaghetti western.
    The songs seem destined for such a film, what with their ghostly translations of
    peremptorily Western themes.  And if the idea of owning something so unmistakably
    leftfield appeals to you, you'll probably love In the Wire. If not, then
    go spend your money on something less eclectic like the Strokes.

    Okay, the Burton thing was a bad analogy but that doesn't change the quality of
    these four songs, available only on this limited edition release of two 45s. I
    don't know whether flipping the record after every track is supposed to make
    listening a more interactive experience or if it's just an unforeseen hassle
    that helped contribute to the medium's demise, but it actually helps the flow
    of the EP rather than hindering it. The more macabre pieces-- including the title
    number-- can be conveniently found on the first record, whereas the second
    features more formulaic country-inspired tunes. Such a contrast in style usually
    implies a lack of sonic direction, but one Friends of Dean Martinez's traits is
    the ability to infuse their characteristic sound with any genre that crosses
    their path.

    The slide guitar still sounds like an amalgamation of Ennio Morricone and David
    Gilmour (circa Meddle), and the band still has an affinity for ethereal
    reverb.  Yet, there are definite signs of progress littered throughout this
    collection.  Such is the case with ""Main Theme,"" which features some of the most
    complex arrangements to ever grace a Friends release. Dave Lachance and Brad
    Fordham have evolved from an ample rhythm section backing the interwoven guitar
    play of Mike Semple and Bill Elm to versatile contributors responsible for some
    truly stellar dynamics.  Over the years, Elm and Semple seem to have made a few
    discoveries in their ever-constant pursuit of ""subtlety,"" a long, elusive
    attribute that, when achieved, greatly increases the effectiveness of their work.
    And periodically, the band relies on gentle flourishes of mellotron or organ
    rather than the typical slide guitar frenzy that's commonly found at the center
    of the group's efforts.

    The songs are a little more raw this time around, though not drastically enough
    to estrange long-time fans.  Rather, Friends of Dean Martinez appear to be
    rationally developing the more experimental methods of sculpting noise they
    introduced on Atardecer while preserving the sound of a band playing live.
    On the EP's title cut, they succeed by adding tinges of psychedelia to their
    instrumental lamentations.  Elsewhere, on ""Wichita Lineman,"" the orchestration
    offers more diversity than on previous excursions. In this modern resurgence of
    instrumental bands tentatively titled ""post-rock,"" it's hard to retain an
    individual style while still flirting with new, unexampled recipes for
    songwriting. It's good to know that Friends of Dean Martinez are past the stage
    of dipping their toes in the water and are on their way to realizing their
    full potential."
11479	10120	"
    Suffolk, England resident Chantal Passamonte has been incorporating field
    recordings into pulsating, grimy beats since the mid-90s, when a prolific
    career spinning as DJ Chantal gave way to organic experiments off the dance
    floor. With each successive album on Warp, Mira Calix has migrated away from
    any discernible genre. She scraps familiar structure in favor of
    ""conducting"" live crickets, using rocks as percussion, and
    masterfully orchestrating strings, winds, and piano around such innovations. Eyes
    Set Against the Sun is not unlike Herbert's Score in its visually
    evocative mood-making.
    The album is reverential to physicality, focusing on the organic rather than
    the theoretical. While the songs don't always confine themselves to the
    development-climax-denouement format, there's often a complex reworking of
    classical structures going on. With modern flair, Passamonte will stick with a line of melody for an unexpectedly long time: the pizzicato string
    section on ""The Way You Are When"", for instance, is a creepy filmic
    scene, but resists the added drama of counter-melodies and modifying twists.
    Instead, whispering vocals just barely enhance the pressurized tension of
    having the pizzicato riff repeated ad infinitum. Just under eleven minutes long, the song is epic without
    being overindulgent, and it turns out there is something of a backbone, a loop
    back to the soothing string legato of its opening minutes, much as a symphony
    might. At the close, a youthful choral section strives to reach emotive heights
    the song hadn't yet dared to. There's no discernible
    matrix enclosing the piece in precedent or audience expectation, and many
    of the songs seem to quietly thumb their nose at the human role even as they're
    dependent on it.
    Passamonte's curious meanderings with water effects and lifelike
    instrumentation (string plucks, pulls, and scrapes) on ""Because to
    Why"" make for a dark scene. Along with two other tracks, this opener
    conveys the most explicit verbal messages on the album, the rest of the songs
    liberated in our imagination by minimal or nonexistent vocals. On
    ""Why"" and its follow-up ""The Stockholm Syndrome"", she
    juxtaposes what could be joyous lyrics with minor keys and blasts of Dr. Who
    synths. ""Umbra/Penumbra"" brings us a resolute piano melody, happier
    string loops, and skulking drum machines amid the words, ""You make me feel
    like summer's never coming/ You make me feel like nothing's ever true.""
    Exploring this contrast both pokes fun at the decisive, long-understood
    emotional meaning behind major and minor keys. Or, if we are to retain those
    old meanings, suggests how her words may be connoted positively.

    Passamonte has performed alongside the London Sinfonietta and created
    soundscapes for art installations. As Mira Calix, she expresses her interest in
    crossing artistic endeavors with natural processes. Her effects borrow from
    nature, imitate it, and deferentially fuse it with man-made interpretation, as
    on ""Belonging (No Longer Mix)"", which draws on tribal music, dance
    halls, weather systems, wing-beats, and computers for a glaringly mechanized
    atmosphere that's still utterly free of human presence. Mira Calix hasn't
    exactly embraced lyricism, teetering between landscape soundtrack and songbook
    on many of her releases. Here, vocals take a definitive back seat-- when they
    do appear, it's as a ghostly, digitally fabricated instrument that inserts
    language into the broadly relatable wash of beautiful, scary, preliterate
    meaning. Passamonte's playful, deeply moving orchestration continually poses new
    questions about music's own language. Written English doesn't necessarily
    get in the way, but the voiceless material is a book without pictures that
    speaks volumes.
    "
17857	7336	"Will Oldham has a doppelganger of sorts in Jason Molina, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia. No, Molina hasn't been known to sport a Marxian beard, and he's long since ditched his multiple monikers. But he has a few other things in common with Oldham, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, Molina released a single on the Palace imprint; he now consistently records with a rotating cast of musicians; and Ghost Tropic was Molina's second full-length release of 2000 (The Lioness came earlier in the year).But the connection runs deeper. Molina also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with sparse instrumentation. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly as poetic and dark. Then, of course, the most obvious comparison: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, Molina's pipes are cleaner than Oldham's-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those rare high notes. But when low-key, his voice sounds disconcertingly similar. Thus, given that since 1999's Axxess & Ace-- his highwatermark thus far-- Molina has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved closer in nature to Oldham's. On Ghost Tropic, where Molina's voice is now similarly broken, the difference would be indistinguishable to the untrained ear.The comparison between Molina and Oldham has been made time and again, and is probably as sickening to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the tired comparison: never before has it been more apt. Ghost Tropic, the band's fifth proper full-length, makes even The Lioness seem, at the very least, content. For his version of ""I See a Darkness""-- or rather, ""I See a Heart of Darkness""-- Molina again enlisted Alasdair Roberts of Appendix Out, who also played on The Lioness, as well as members of Lullaby for the Working Class. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable.Ghost Tropic was recorded at Dead Space Recording Studio in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a haunted hut somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, ""Lightning Risked It All,"" which begins with wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune after each note, and the lines, ""Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The broad luck of blood on the water."" But these words aren't delivered with any rapidity: you're given enough time between each line to consider eternity. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might subtly increasing percussion. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly restless wooden clacks that sound like water dripping in puddles.The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks rarely progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a thunderous piano, both of which are occasionally complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or shrill triangle. And Molina's voice inevitably enters in, usually after the one-minute mark, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, ""Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"" (""The Body Burned Away""), or, ""Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"" (""No Limits on the Words"").But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the choice of instruments, lyrics, or Molina's voice-- are the tropical birds. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, Molina doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of his album. Instead, birdsong slides in now and then, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only occasionally do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two instrumental tracks entitled ""Ghost Tropic,"" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the unsettling music emanating from the hut.None of the eight tracks that comprise Ghost Tropic are true songs. They're more like movements that make up the larger whole of the album, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated two or three times. In short, this is a mood piece. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and incompletely at others. The two 12-minute tracks that essentially end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously sluggish and repetitive on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a liter of water: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that your patience will make the experience entirely satisfying."
412	22338	"Prince had a curious approach to live albums. After Purple Rain put his crowd-stunning skills on worldwide display, subsequent concert artifacts took the form of coffee table books or low-profile home video releases. And he could be a merciless tease. With “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night,” from Sign ‘O’ the Times, Prince offered listeners an onstage clip of the Revolution operating at peak inspiration only after he’d broken up that band. During the compilation set Crystal Ball, the conclusion of a searing live take on “The Ride” is rudely cut off by the forgettable dance number ""Get Loose.""These perversions are not unwitting. Prince knew admirers bootlegged his shows. Message boards on his various online “music clubs” were often clogged with requests for official live discs. In 2002, before his Musicology comeback, he gave these hardcore fans what they wanted, at long last. Sort of. One Nite Alone…Live! was a box set that chronicled the tour in support of Prince’s similarly titled piano-and-vocals CD. But these setlists also explored another recent Prince recording, The Rainbow Children—a concept album that heralded his conversion to the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Given the outlier that Children was in his catalog, a follow-up live release that repeated the same sermons over its first two discs was met with some frustration. Still, most detractors couldn’t ignore the third CD, which presented a rush of screaming blues licks, rowdy funk-ensemble workouts, and sultry soul, all captured during “aftershow” parties from this same tour. Years later, Prince carved out this third disc as a standalone title for sale on one of his websites. Similarly, it is now available for streaming and purchase on Tidal, along with the majority of the NPG Records catalog. There’s much to savor from that oft-overlooked wilderness period, but the urgent showmanship of One Nite Alone… The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over! makes it a highlight in Prince’s discography and a gratifying, much-needed connection with his ability to take it to the stage. While avoiding his biggest hits, this nearly hour-long ride finds Prince engaging with key selections from his repertoire. The opening song, “Joy in Repetition,” dates from sessions that produced Sign ‘O’ the Times, and was later included in the scattershot soundtrack to Prince’s box-office bomb Graffiti Bridge. Here, Prince airs it out for over ten minutes, recasting it as both a band-introduction tool and a showcase for his electric guitar showboating.Subtle revision of the song’s lyrics is as close as he comes to any lecturing on Aftershow. Prince ad libs a brief bit about his new aversion to “four-letter words,” though the singer’s come-hither delivery ensures that the change does no harm to the song’s slinky vibe. Gradually, his command of the blues emerges as the focal point of the performance. The unhurried stretches of soloing carry a different air than other Prince guitar clinics—such as his famed feature during a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tribute to George Harrison. He obsesses over individual passages with a spiritual ferocity that can stand with late-period Coltrane. It’s indulgent, excessive, and brilliant. Then George Clinton joins the band, and the intergenerational lineup of funk visionaries gels just like you’d hope. In the early going of “We Do This,” the track has a loose-booty feel that provides ideal support for Clinton’s scat-rap. And while Prince starts out by shooting rhythm guitar darts into the pocket, the jam climaxes when Clinton’s raspiest vocalizations spur some joyous, arcing lead lines from the bandleader. This song is the most compelling meeting between the two artists yet to see the light of day.The guest-vocalist portion of the show concludes with Musiq’s appearance during a brief medley that mixes his own tune “Just Friends (Sunny)” with Sly Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay.” After the different extremes advanced by the opening two songs, this selection introduces the more relaxed aesthetic that Prince could use to make these late-night encounters with a global icon feel like casual parties. Since these recordings date from Prince’s peak period of overt jazz exploration, his backing band is skilled in the art of reinterpretation. The rhythm section of drummer John Blackwell and bassist Rhonda Smith helps transform deep cuts like the instrumental “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” into something less nervy than Prince fashioned by himself during sessions for The Black Album. On Aftershow, the mood is exultant and celebratory.“I wanna sing, but it’s too funky,” the artist tells the crowd at one point. And then, after steering the band through a brisk “Alphabet Street,” he mostly dispenses with pop-song singing—all the better to work as a dance instructor for the rest of the album. During the infinity groove of “Peach (Xtended Jam),” Prince reminds concertgoers that this isn’t an arena rock show, but a club (“Ain’t nothing to look at; y’all just party where ya are.”) Then, at the turnaround, he unveils a new rhythm guitar progression: a line that begins with an aggressive stabbing figure, and then rolls on with delirious suavity. It’s a reminder of Prince’s guitar heroics outside the realm of the solo.The way the whole set works brings to mind black scholar Albert Murray’s understanding of the “Saturday Night Function” during the period of early jazz, which the theorist contrasted with the role of the Sunday morning gospel service. In discussion with Wynton Marsalis, Murray described the Function as “a purification ritual where you get rid of the blues. And as soon as you get rid of the blues, it becomes a fertility ritual. . . . The union of lovers, which is the salvation of the species! . . . If it’s not sexy, forget it.” On his “One Nite Alone” tour, Prince reversed the chronology, putting the sermons during the main gig, and providing erotic release at the aftershow. Both halves of the experience should be fascinating for any fan of this elite composer and performer. But if you’re downhearted by his absence, it may be that you'll want to turn to the blues-chasing set first. Unlike the nudist dip in Lake Minnetonka prescribed to Apollonia during Purple Rain, the purification ritual on offer here is no joke."
15481	3597	"Some time around my sophomore year of high school, I just gave up.  Frustrated by the music I was hearing
    on the radio, and lacking the guidance of a knowledgeable older sibling or a hip college radio station, my
    interest in music gradually devolved into belligerent apathy.  Turning what little hope I had left towards
    the Internet, I happened upon a group whose bandname interested me: Guided by Voices.  In what, for me,
    seemed an incredibly defiant gesture at the time, I ordered Mag Earwhig! without having heard a
    note of it, and five-to-seven business days later, I had a new favorite band.

    A year later, my new favorite band put out a new album.  Do the Collapse was host to a few great
    tracks, but the cheesier moments sprinkled liberally over Robert Pollard's songs proved tremendously
    disheartening.  For the first time, I took to reading reviews of Guided by Voices' records, each one
    fortifying my belief that the quality of their output had been spiraling downward since the glory days
    of Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes.  Over the course of Guided by Voices' next few albums,
    my excitement began to wane, and by the time Earthquake Glue was released this year, I had all
    but lost interest in Guided by Voices.

    Up until recently, I'd never have thought that a one of these collections could rekindle my interest in a
    long-neglected band-- it's just hard to shake the feeling that enjoying a best-of album is like beating a
    video game with all the cheat codes on.  But listening to Human Amusements at Hourly Rates, it
    becomes immediately clear that Guided by Voices' vast and uneven catalog is perfectly suited for this
    treatment.  Over the course of fifteen records, two (going on three) box sets, and countless singles and
    EPs, Robert Pollard has written more than enough brilliant songs to carry five of these things.  But those
    great songs have always been broken up by weaker tracks on GBV full-lengths, putting a damper on the
    momentum that could be generated by an uninterrupted sequence of near-perfect rock tracks.

    On Human Amusements, this unadulterated flow of excellence is fully realized, and the results are
    absolutely glorious.  Best-of records are frequently criticized for robbing songs of the context created
    by their respective albums, but Human Amusements succeeds largely for this very reason, collecting
    material from the most seemingly disparate eras of Guided by Voices' output, and reconstructing them into
    a surprisingly cohesive whole.  The shallow and misleading ""lo-fi"" tag has led many to construct an
    impregnable descriptive barrier between ""early"" and ""late"" Guided by Voices, but Human Amusements
    is an alarmingly seamless listen.  Indeed, the way the album is sequenced often serves to draw attention
    away from discrepancies in production, and towards the uniformly excellent quality of Pollard's songwriting.

    Many of the songs on Human Amusements actually come across much better here than they did on their
    respective albums.  The synth-whispers of ""Things I Will Keep"", which seemed so insincere and cheesy on
    Do the Collapse, now appear utterly insignificant when compared to the song's gorgeous melody and
    subtle rhythmic variations.  The languid melancholy of ""To Remake the Young Flyer"", which got slightly
    lost in the submerged early sections of Under the Bushes Under the Stars, is twice as affecting
    immediately following the crisp, upbeat pop of ""Game of Pricks"".  The few selections chosen from Pollard's
    pre-Propeller era are top notch, and much easier to stomach outside of the generally mediocre albums
    from which they were drawn.

    As with any best-of album from a band with such a vast output, the final tracklist is bound to be the
    subject of debate.  Personally, I don't see how ""Smothered in Hugs"", what I would consider to be the best
    song on Bee Thousand and a perennial fan favorite, could have been omitted from an otherwise
    well-considered tracklist.  I was also disappointed to see that ""Weed King"" from Propeller and ""Don't
    Stop Now"" and ""Drag Days"" from Under the Bushes were left out.  Ultimately, though, it's hard to
    register much of any disappointment with the tracks that Pollard did choose.  Rather than simply picking
    his favorite tracks, Pollard seems to have put a lot of thought into selecting a sequence of songs that
    holds together incredibly well as an album.

    Aside from an album cover that looks like a 12-year-old's first Photoshop project, there are plenty of
    reasons to be skeptical of Human Amusements at Hourly Rates.  Best-of albums are generally disjointed
    and disappointing, especially if you're already familiar with the band's output, and Robert Pollard hasn't
    exactly shown himself to be the most adept person at judging his own work.  But the momentum and contrast
    worked into Human Amusements is so staggering that it far exceeds any Guided by Voices mix CD I've
    ever put together or heard.  Listening to this album now, I can feel echoes of the same giddy excitement
    that I haven't been able to fully recapture since I listened to Mag Earwhig! for the very first
    time.  I may have heard them all a hundred times before, but these are my 32 new favorite songs."
8571	13475	"A girl whose first sexual experience was a molestation is encouraged to overcome her trauma and learn to feel real love. White Americans are confronted with their role in the legacy of slavery and their responsibility for the cultural and social structures it left behind. Immigrants, a child of divorced parents, and a self-hating gay teenager get a keep-your-head-up. The ostracized, leprous son of a plantation owner learns to sing from the field hands, only to reject his family's adulation of his talents when he realizes they won't let those same field hands inside their house. These are some of the ways Brother Ali focuses his storytelling talents on Us, and I just wanted to mention that as soon as possible because some people may prefer an advance warning when a rap album is filled with what is perceived as moralistic sermonizing.But this isn't ""moralistic sermonizing"" where Brother Ali is concerned-- it's displays of a humane, often-troubled conscience. For an MC who has so many tracks which denote his ""bad motherfucker"" status, his persona's dominated by a welcoming strain of populist empathy, an attitude that offers an accessible solidarity just for listening. And unless you happen to be someone who thinks he's a better MC than Ali is, this man will not actually talk down to you, no matter how sociopolitically agitated he gets. If rap didn't exist, he'd be the greatest high school guidance counselor in Minneapolis. But as a talent in a scene that holds decades' worth of some of the most sensitive identity politics of any popular culture movement in the last 50 years, Brother Ali has had to put that populism to good use.The political material on Us is powerful without being self-righteous: ""The Travelers"" runs through every dehumanizing abuse in the slave trade in its gutwrenching first verse, then spends the second hinging on culpability, complete with an admission that he's been ""terrified to admit it's wrong/ 'Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on."" The blues-cadenced ""Breakin' Dawn"", meanwhile, works in both a literal and allegorical sense, with the story of the master's son taught to sing by the slaves a fable that also hints at latter-day whitewashing in the music industry (and, by potential extension, that theoretical listener who bumps Brother Ali without paying heed or respect to his influences). And while ""Games"" resembles your typical get-off-the-corner message rap on the surface, Ali puts himself on the hustler's level instead of scolding him. Still, the man does have his limits: ""House Keys"" has his family moving downstairs from the second floor of a duplex only to find that his new upstairs neighbors are a bunch of noisy, bickering small-time drug dealers, a problem which he addresses by sneaking into their place when they're out, stealing all their shit, and selling it.He does have moments where he makes himself the subject, whether needy and heartbroken on ""You Say (Puppy Love)"" or rolling his eyes at haters on ""Crown Jewel"". And there's still plenty of times-- ""Bad Mufucker Pt. II"", ""'Round Here"", ""Fresh Air""-- where he seems content to rattle off gratitude-swagger testimonials to his own career, a tendency that's served his style well from the beginning. I've read a few dismissals of Ali's style as a blatant copy of Pharoahe Monch's, and I don't quite hear it beyond the subtle debt practically every indie rapper ever owes Organized Konfusion: Ali's lyricism forgoes Monch's rewind-provoking abstraction for an approach heavy on straightforward scene-setting, willing to sacrifice complex internal rhyme schemes and rimshot metaphors if it means he can paint you a clearer picture. With those strengths, he's somewhere between the intense street-scholar style of Freeway-- who appears, along with Joell Ortiz, on the shit-talk highlight ""Best@it""-- and an eloquent everyman like Murs, who has a non-rapping cameo telling an amusing story about how Brother Ali's mere presence cooled down a tense situation. Dude can still be pretty acrobatic when he wants to-- ""The Preacher"" makes for a hell of a skeptic-converter-- yet there's also a clarity and non-pretension to his lyrics that, coupled with the smooth rasp of his voice, makes them fully attention-commanding.It should be noted that this album's original title was Street Preacher, a concept that still manifests in a few spots (like the Chuck D intro and the track it segues into, ""The Preacher""). And ANT, who's produced nearly everything Ali's spit over since his Rhymesayers debut, Shadows on the Sun, turns in a characteristic set of clean, crisp modern soul that accompanies his usual 1970s-skewing R&B touchstones (mournfully-glimmering minimalist g-funk on ""Slippin' Away""; slinky Bar-Kays strut on ""Fresh Air"") with a gospel-soul current. It's a proper backdrop for an album that stands as the most deeply thought-provoking work of Brother Ali's career, an album that draws its strengths from the simultaneous expression of sympathy toward the people in the songs and anger toward the shit they've gone through. The album's title track is gospel personified-- a choir, handclaps, and a rapt MC laying down his idealistic vision of an America that still feels a long way off: ""Can't nobody be free unless we're all free/ There's no me and you, it's just us."""
15707	6450	"Cultural orgasm.  Whisper in my ear and tell me you hate me.  Vikings invade the Mediterranean and don't
    leave.  Diarrhea takes over your life.  These are all titles from Scott Herren's latest EP, a relentless
    megamix of material that didn't make it into his latest album.  And no, I couldn't resist spouting them
    all up front.  Let's just move on.

    Last time on Prefuse: The One Word Extinguisher LP documented a loss to be cherished.  The raw
    material was putrid and abrasive, but it was smoothed a thousand times over in the obsessive preening of
    the mourning process.  Prefuse tried to crush and explode himself, to revile and revel in and revise the
    emptiness.  Nothing seemed to work.  Then, somewhere near the last third of the album, it sank in: She
    was gone, even her impression was gone, and the beats were still dropping.  Music had healed itself again.
Extinguished: Outtakes doesn't look back into that mess.  There's no secret suffering or swollen
    self-denial, just a truckload of DATs full of sick-ass beats.  The mix is verbal, hyped, rich, impatient,
    and constantly pushing forward.  With a lot of the music on Herren's Eastern Developments label, the hard
    part of my job is to find purchase on the smooth surface of a non-verbal document.  With Prefuse, and
    especially this EP, the music is so monstrously verbal that I'm worried it will review me.  Here
    are the trademark vocal scraps and battle rhymes, yes, but also an array of dirty samples and relentless
    sequences that barrel through your Broca's brain with big balls and no brakes.

    There are literally dozens of fragments here, for the most part ranging in length between five and ninety
    seconds.  Each captures Herren's riddled attention long enough to get dropped in, flipped, then scrapped
    for the next.  It's a dizzying and crowded ride, not always pleasant, and not one that can be navigated
    actively.  What did you do during the Blackout of 2003?  Rush home, search for candles and batteries, call
    loved ones?  You should have set up a lawn chair in the middle of the Manhattan bridge and let the exodus
    wash over you with a daiquiri in one hand and a discman spinning Prefuse in the other.  This album is like
    crowdgazing: If you don't tense up under the strain, it starts to wash over you in a way you can breathe
    through.  It's a labyrinth, but check your watch: Less than forty minutes have elapsed.

    The madness begins with a custom collage of rodeo Rhodes, mambo brass, curses, interview with an old-timer
    from the last days of the jazz age, and, inevitably, the rapture of a brisk, sample-driven limp.  This
    alternates with a dirty-south feel built on the same samples, until the whole thing is swept aside for a
    thick, janky live feel.  There's some chanting and the usual layered dirtwash, and then a vital, effluvial
    spray of mud and guts.  Pase Rock gives an unremarkable shoutout, and we're ready to push this sucker up
    to the precipice so it can drop for real.

    A harsh, cramped vamp: sick, rich clav scurrying all over the sawtooth basement.  Skittish drill punctures
    little holes in a boom-bip clench already riddled with ligaments.  A minute of strict, reckless, glorious
    invention in this vein, then the same beat is exposed in a stream of pre-sweetened sinewaves.  Ripples
    forming around it push into a leisurely grind with some faded vocal hyping and a contagious snap-habit.
    Whining, malfunctioning synths do their abrupt flitters, squalls and death laughs.

    Then a dirty one-two with faded guitars and rotted flute.  Muted backspun whispers wire-tripping you into
    the snare every single time.  Dribbled out into a froth of beatlets, pressured into giving note on the
    sixteenths, a soprano rebels.  Nasty-ass retarded old school cereal box top decoder ring jam.  Clav-busters
    with a glut of cutthroat mugs, and all to kill the garage punk interlude.  Overheard at a local wedding
    reception, a stuffed shirt muttering: ""Fuck you if you think that's bold.  I couldn't feel your shit if
    my hands were stuck inside your asshole.""  Such sublime humor, all but buried in the beat salad.

    Caulked-up fuzz bass riding a slaw of creaks and cracks.  Alloys that strain the caustic slats.  Muscular
    and doubled, chime delights a cadence uncontested: clap to the tick, tick to the trip, stiff with a tensile
    tip, let it rip.  Whistle-dropped one to the punch of something fibrous, well-wrought with a grime delight.
    No effects, no intricacies, just a man and his sampler.  Fives and threes stutter, wrong and bloodied like
    Mahler slotted into a Pharoahe Monch parody, and after all this, six whole minutes of cello and a headwrap,
    a Delarosa and Asora-worthy splay of velvet benevolence to lock in the freshness.  Then, finally, abruptly,
    it skids to a halt with the blink-fast deceleration of stopped vinyl."
18192	942	"When Pitchfork last saw Connor Oberst, he was wailing through Letting Off the
    Happiness, an album that asked a lot of questions and never answered any of
    them.  For example, our neighbors are still wondering what that bizarre, strangled
    moan was.  And the Violent Femmes' Gordon Gano is still wondering who made off
    with his vocal chords.  I, of course, am wondering how anybody could possibly
    have so much to worry about at the age of 19.  Actually, now that I think of it,
    Bill Gates was 19 when he made his first million (probably).  And in that respect,
    you could say Oberst is the Bill Gates of mid-western adolescent rage-- he's got
    way more than any of us will ever need.

    Now, somebody once said that money can buy a certain amount of happiness, but after
    that, all it can get is more money.  Ditto to Midwestern adolescent rage, if you
    substitute ""punk rock"" for happiness.  There exists a threshold for yelling and
    screaming about how much stuff sucks, and crossing that threshold cam only make
    your music suck, too.  Thankfully, Bright Eyes doesn't cross that line.  Oh, but
    he's toeing it!  Those of us who don't spend our days sitting in our bedrooms
    counting spiders may find the occasional lyric here cringe-inducing.

    But for the most part, Bright Eyes writes songs that are unlike most other peoples'
    songs.  Despite the aforementioned similarity to early Violent Femmes, and the
    annoying fact that this EP's best song (""A Perfect Sonnet"") pretty much mimics
    Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" the five tracks here are pretty unique.  Oberst's
    death-obsessed lyrics may be tough to swallow now and then, but when they hit their
    mark, they're undeniable.

    The instrumentation on Every Day, Every Night is varied and accomplished, and
    flaunts the same raw production values that made Elliott Smith's Either/Or
    sound both graceful and believable.  It also doesn't hurt that Oberst's voice is
    left a little lower in the mix.  To supplement the acoustic guitar, Bright Eyes
    draws sounds from an array of sources, from backwards drums to Chinese language
    tapes.  And somehow, the various bits never seem gratuitous or disingenuous.

    What seems most important about these songs, though, is that they never really
    become self-indulgent.  As more and more schmoes out there scrape up a couple of
    bucks to buy guitars and four-tracks, it's becoming increasingly important to set
    some standards.  (Hey, no one wants to wade through EPs from every third person in
    America.)  The ongoing democratization of music could be either a miracle or a
    disaster.  It's just good to know that there are people like Connor Oberst out
    there raising the bar."
14650	8589	"""What can be romantic to Mike Watt?  He's only a skeleton.""

    Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from Watt's ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on Double
    Nickels on the Dime, it sounded like an inside joke.  By then it was already evident that Watt was one
    of punk rock's biggest and most self-reflective romantics.  From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and
    the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the fIREHOSE years and his busy but erratic
    solo career, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or
    jamming econo that our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses hasn't found romantic.

    All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when Watt suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction
    even more gruesome than it sounds.  This horrendous episode very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but
    he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a not-entirely-unromantic account of this brush with death
    on his self-described punk opera, Secondman's Middle Stand.

    Watt has never been one to crib pages from someone else's rulebook, but Middle Stand is an idiosyncratic
    work even by his standards.  Constructed loosely on Dante's Divine Comedy, the album bases three songs
    apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso"").  The instrumental line-up
    is kept light and lean, with Watt on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of Jerry Trebotic on drums,
    Pete Mazich on organ and frequent background vocals from Petra Haden.

    It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate
    Mazich's ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted punk's
    invention in the first place.  But once you convince yourself that Mazich is not, in fact, about to break
    into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the broad array of textures that the
    instrument brings to Watt's preferred power trio format.

    With his trusty thunderbroom functioning as his Virgil, Watt doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the
    underworld.  ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the
    drums and organ roil nauseously.  ""No!"" Watt screams back defiantly.  ""I'm going to make it through this
    hellride.""

    Things do get awfully hellish in the early going, and Watt spares us few gory details on tracks like the
    surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving,
    Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds Watt trapped inside an infernal fever dream.  ""I see that thermometer
    in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his
    bulkhead!""  Yikes.

    Throughout the album, Watt delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a
    cross between a diabolical Gregg Allman and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the
    bus.  Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, rapid-fire lyrics and the live-in-the-studio production quality
    often have his vocals getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ.  But his bass work
    is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both
    propulsive rhythmic force and melodic color-bearer.

    And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when Watt, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly
    sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section.  (""The Angel's
    Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.)  When you hear him describe the simple,
    never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on
    ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a brutal ordeal with his boundless
    romanticism intact.  And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages,
    you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making new stands for a long time to come."
14358	2861	"There is an intangible quality that defines truly vital music, something that spans genres and trends and makes itself felt as the sound passes through you. It could be a perfect confluence of notes and timbres or a brilliantly conveyed sentiment, but it could also really be anything. It's not one of those things you can put into effective words-- you just know it when you hear it. And to me, The Ex make vital music.

    For 25 years, the Dutch band have nipped at the fringe of post-punk, steering stridently clear of corporate-owned record labels and lighting up the left side of the political spectrum with more than a dozen albums proudly splattered with anarcho-syndicalist and anti-consumerist sentiment. But they're not just shouting about trade unionism, materialist greed, and the inherent contradictions of modern free-market societies; they can bring the noise, too, and their polemics come wrapped in a blistering package of smoldering art-punk informed by free jazz and global folk. On their latest album, Turn, they elevate their craft to near perfection over the course of two wild, unpredictable, and unforgettable discs.

    The bulk of the songs that comprise Turn hew to The Ex's peculiar brand of crushing, dense post-punk, but the music can veer on a dime into spoken satire, Eritrean freedom songs, and savage improvisation. Steve Albini returns to the boards for them on this album, and nobody captures The Ex better than he does-- the sound is dry and caustic, allergic to reverb, as heavy as Shellac, and relentlessly intense. The band's setup is extremely basic-- guitar, standup bass, and drums-- but they wring a lot out of it, particularly the bass. The instrument is amplified and then scraped, beaten, sawed, and distorted, alternately used to create an annihilating low-end and to emulate electronic effects or panicked voices. The drums are mixed high for maximum damage and principle vocalist GW Sok-- who doesn't sing so much as rant-- winds up somewhere near the middle of it all, a voice caught in a hellstorm of overdriven guitar, unable to control his surroundings but forced to comment on them through a sense of duty.

    Sok runs himself breathless on the brilliant opener ""Listen to the Painters"", clipping syllables in the mantra ""We need poets, we need painters/ We need poets, we need painters/ We need poetry and paintings,"" and his sense of English wordplay is better than that of a lot of native speakers: ""Sheep with crazy leaders/ Heading for disaster/ Courting jesters who take themselves for masters/ The shrub who took himself for a park/ The squeak who took himself for a bark."" The churning guitars and daisy cutter bass tears a hole in the crust of the earth from which Sok's frenetic second verse can pour. He takes his wordplay to incredible satirical heights on ""The Pie"", which opens with a genuinely demented reading of a recipe for sweet potato pie that, as it turns out, is being baked for the purpose of smashing it in the face of authority. Sok piles puns on top of vitriol with the lines ""In a world full of poor and an environment to protect/ An alternative flan of action flies in the face of promises not kept/ It shows that the responsible irresponsibles have faces and names which can be addressed/ Therefore bake and aim and put a smile back on the faces of the oppressed"" as the band rages beneath him; there is darkness at the heart of this humor.

    The band uses the two-disc format to offer the listener a break-- 90 straight minutes of caustic, melody-averse art punk is a lot to take in-- and they intentionally place the album's most violent, punishing, exhilarating track, ""Theme from Konono"", at the beginning of disc two, right next to ""Huriye"", which is both a cover of an Eritrean protest song from their fight for independence from Ethiopia and the most beautifully melodic song on the record. ""Theme from Konono"" is basically a summary of everything the Ex do best, building over the course of several minutes from scratchy guitar interplay into a full-on juggernaut of barreling rhythm. The song piles tension upon tension, building and tightening until it's almost unbearable, finally blowing open with a pounding beat and lockstep guitar riffs and then slowly re-upping the ante. Based on an assault like this, you'd never guess any of these people are over 40.

    About the only bands from punk's original era that are still as bracing and original as The Ex are Wire and The Fall. What's truly amazing about Turn is how colossal, how ingenious, how vital it sounds. Just about any of the current post-punk crop sound downright milquetoast when put up against The Ex's vibrant assault and well-considered commentary. On ""Listen to the Painters"", The Ex remind us of the need for poets and painters and builders and dancers and writers-- by the end of the album, it's clear we need The Ex, too."
7761	14319	"Do the La's really need a box set? This is a band that produced one self-titled LP in 1990 before their melodically gifted but cantankerous leader Lee Mavers declared he'd never release another record. Nevertheless, a few La's reunite live every couple of years, sparking rumors about new material...that never materializes. If nothing else, the optimistically titled and lavishly packaged Callin' All suggests that their record company has finally accepted what fans realized at least a decade ago: The cow’s run dry.Supposedly, Mavers has squirreled away songs in the intervening years, but he doesn't share his stash here. In fact, the band didn't cooperate in any way on Callin' All. How then does Polydor/Universal fill four CDs? There's about a disc and a half worth of material fans might legitimately want, including all of the band's singles and B-sides and some decent demos that never made it into the studio. Then there are six versions of the La's one big cross-border hit. With its hooks, jangle, and now-iconic guitar intro, ""There She Goes"" is an undeniable classic. The La's render it with such gentle, genuine wonder (about a girl or smack, to name the best-supported theories), that 20 years on the song still gets play whenever an evocation of non-specific longing is needed. And, admittedly, the overproduced album track has aged badly, making a demo or two welcome. But six? ""Timeless Melody"", the band's truest statement of purpose, appears eight times, ""Son of a Gun"" six, ""I.O.U."" four, and so on.The La's were a superb live act, and two of the set's discs round up concert and radio recordings. This might be cool if the same or similar material hadn't been available online for years for free or if the record company hadn't already released the definitive La's live collection, BBC in Session, in 2006. ""Never before or since the La's has there been so much fascination and reverence for a band with so slender an output,"" journalist Will Hodgkinson opines hyperbolically in a glossy booklet  padded with oversized photos and a month-by-month timeline of the band's active run. If this sounds like the bottom of the barrel being scraped, it is.But even a disingenuous cash-grab can provide an opportunity for historical reflection. The La's one album is a near-perfect synthesis of scouse skiffle, early American rock'n'roll, and British Invasion sounds. Mavers had a genuine talent for earworms and economical song construction, and if he'd tried harder to play well with others instead of pissing them off, bassist John Power might have contributed more like the exceptional jangle-stomper ""Alright"" (two live versions of which make the box set).Great art, the prevailing theory on the subject goes, forces the artists who follow it to think differently. By that definition, the La's aren't great, or even very good; Britpop, for example, would have happened regardless, in much the same way. For record companies, of course, great=profitable, and Universal would have consumers believe that the short-lived La's were the greatest band that never really was if it means they can sell the same material over and over. But you know what? Fuck greatness. It never adequately quantifies the intense relationship fans have with certain songs or the way they make them feel. On these terms, the La's own a small, glorious pop legacy. Bypass the bloated $60 set and buy their $12 album."
17924	8348	"The members of Underworld are smart, savvy lads. They've worked on solving
    the difficulties inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno
    live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out,
    just before Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released, was at a twisted
    club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the famous London boite, Heaven.
    That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs
    opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The
    Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl
    house of Heaven. After a few hours of DJ sets, a band took the small,
    almost ad hoc stage, and stylistic divisions in the area immediately
    vanished.

    Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off
    Dubnobasswithmyheadman, liquidly morphing from ""Mmm Skyscraper,
    I Love You"" and ""Rez"" to ""Cowgirl"" and ""Dirty Epic."" I didn't know any
    of these classics at the time, but after a two-hour set and having been
    a part of the euphoria this band concocted, they became my most precious
    band.

    And rarely have they, in the years since that club gig, disappointed. I
    saw them perform before Second Toughest in the Infants saw
    release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds
    of Dubno with the breakbeats the band had been experimenting with for
    the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated
    in the rolling out of the new style Underworld.
Everything, Everything documents the live stage that followed
    breakbeat Underworld. Beaucoup Fish hinted at trance and electro,
    but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. Beaucoup Fish
    recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through
    with a palpable mourning.  That Darren Emerson-- the member who took
    them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music
    icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S.
    reception to date makes it all the more poignant.

    Though Everything, Everything is unquestionably a swan song for
    the Emerson years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles
    early tracks like ""Rez"" and ""Cowgirl,"" and pumps them up with megawatt
    power. It also serves as a greatest hits package, including their most
    famed numbers, ""Pearl's Girl"" and ""Push Upstairs,"" among others.

    Vocalist Karl Hyde predictably reserves his loudest delivery for the
    ""Shouting Lager! Lager! Lager!"" line in the 12-minute, bone-buckling
    rendition of ""Born Slippy Nuxx.""  But as with all live albums, one
    misses the being-there. Sure, Everything, Everything documents
    the crowd's loopy joy when the piano vamps of ""King of Snake"" break
    though the filthy Giorgio Moroder-inspired bass line. But we miss the
    visuals.

    The sine qua non component of Underworld is Tomato, the experimental
    graphic design firm of which Hyde and Smith are members. The cut-up,
    scraggly, ugly beauty of Tomato's type solutions are matched and
    amplified in Hyde's Byron Gisin-ish lyrics (e.g. ""Got my 501s freeze-
    dried with a new religion"").  Underworld are aware of the significant
    piece missing from Everything, Everything and will soon release
    a DVD version, which will insert Tomato into the live document.  Looks
    like these lads really have thought of everything."
17406	1411	"Vocalists are in the privileged position within the common rock band structure.
    They have the unique ability to ruin an otherwise good band all by themselves.
    Don't agree? When's the last time you were downright annoyed by a guitarist,
    drummer or bassist-- not by their personality, but by their playing? Unless you
    subscribe to Bass Player magazine, I'm guessing this doesn't happen very
    often. The musicianship might be uninspired or mediocre, but rarely does it
    single-handedly ruin a band. Vocalists are another story all together.

    This is basically the situation between me and Check Engine's self-titled debut:
    enjoy the music, can hardly stand the lyrics and singing. It's like King Crimson
    all over again.  Robert Fripp & Co. have never been able to find a suitable
    vocalist or lyricist. As a consequence, their two best albums are easily Red
    and Lark's Tongue in Aspic, two albums mostly devoid of lyrics. And
    actually, Check Engine's brand of ultra-precise, frenetic guitar noodling
    strongly suggests a heavy Crimson presence in the band's collective record
    stash. A lot of early Zappa, too; some of these melodies are straight off of
    Hot Rats. It's art-rock focused through the lens of late 70s post-punk.

    Before I get too far ahead of myself, I should mention that Check Engine is an
    offshoot of the Chicago-based math-rock band Sweep the Leg Johnny, featuring
    saxophonist/vocalist Steve Sostak and guitarist Chris Daly. In fact, if I didn't
    know any better, I would think this was Sweep the Leg Johnny. There are differences,
    but it's nothing too pronounced. Sostak's alto sax still holds major sway over
    the proceedings, but with two guitars and two singers going at it as well, there's
    enough happening in the high range to keep ears busy wandering down the
    interlocking melody lines as if in a garden of forking paths.

    That said, the rhythm section is Check Engine's real strength. After the first
    few times through this album, I found myself listening almost exclusively to the
    drums and bass. In terms of young rock drummers, Brian Wnukowski's drumming is
    the next best thing to the Dismemberment Plan's Joe Easley. And Wnukowski's way
    of interacting with bassist Paul Joyce is nothing short of exhilarating. Not
    that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds
    of the brief and blistering album opener, ""Where's my Social Worker?,"" it becomes
    apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which
    they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered. It gives the
    music a visceral, gritty, and almost bluesy feel despite the fact that the guys
    seem incapable of playing in strict 4/4 time.

    Which, of course, brings us to the vocals.  As I've said, they're not so hot.
    Try as I might, I just couldn't get around them. I mean, if you're going to be
    vague, at least use words that sound cool together.  Lines like, ""An entire world
    waits/ In figures and lines/ For a graceless kind of lover,"" from ""She Asked Me
    Some Questions and I Answered Them,"" aren't very evocative.  And, ""But there its
    advantages end/ Before we had any time to send any pictures of our game faces,""
    from ""Don't Make Friends with Salad,"" is just plain clunky.  (Strangely enough, I
    like the song titles a lot, but they seem to have little relation to the lyrics
    of each song. And yes, the latter title is a ""Simpsons"" reference in case you're
    wondering.)

    In effect, Check Engine has two lead singers-- one a little more lead
    than the other-- but they both sing with such over-the-top earnestness that it
    seems like they're trying to compensate for the plain bad lyrics (""But we really
    mean it!!!""). I'm sorry, but sheer force of will just isn't enough in this case.
    In the grand scheme of things, the lyrics and singing aren't as annoying on the
    same scale as, say, those of Enrique Iglesias, but they do heavily detract from
    an otherwise well conceived and executed collection of songs."
7677	14389	"Maps & Atlases released a few EPs before Perch Patchwork, their debut full-length, and the band has done a fair amount of growing up in the meantime. Those early releases were classic math-rock, typified by busy guitar lines borrowed from 90s bands like Don Caballero. Maps & Atlases are far from the only band from Chicago to use that sound as a starting point, but they're one of the few to try and move it forward and successfully translate it into pop songs. Perch Patchwork almost leaves the flashy musicianship entirely behind; when it is there, it puts it to good use-- here they turn their quirks into something diverse and accessible.Foremost among those is Dave Davison's voice-- a reedy, almost froggy baritone. (Think Mark Morrison of ""Return of the Mack"" and you're not far off.) Yet he sings naturally and confidently, and even carries many of the songs here on the strength of his performance. ""The Charm"" builds to layered, clattering percussion with no melody at all save for Davison's vocal line-- the anchor and selling point of an affecting love song. Elsewhere, the band is at its best when it leaps furthest outside of its comfort zone: ""Solid Ground"" forgoes complicated instrumental lines in favor of layered production, where guitar, bass, and voice contribute only a fraction of the song's many earworms. The same goes for the bubbly power-pop of ""Israeli Caves""; these are melodically busy tracks, but every addition is balanced and thoughtful, no performer stepping over another, all serving the song. On the second half of Perch Patchwork, the fingers get a little more fleet and the math-rock woodshedding shows, and all those busy notes start to run into each other, making the beginning and end of each track less discernible. But taken on their own, many of those songs feature creative left turns, whether it's the Latin instrumentation that crashes the sparse, rubbery riff of ""Pigeon"" or the campfire strumming between the jagged acoustic licks of ""Was"". That track might remind you of the mellower moments on Dirty Projectors' Bitte Orca, and the brief instrumentals that serve as interludes on Perch Patchwork have the gentle folksiness and thick atmosphere of Grizzly Bear's Yellow House.  But while Maps & Atlases are milder and less daring than either of those bands, Perch Patchwork is eclectic and consistent enough that each detour offers its own small reward."
12069	9465	"
    In 1960s Phoenix, Mike Lenaburg was a scenester without much of a scene.
    Having grown up in L.A., the white, British-born, r&b-loving Lenaburg was
    used to plenty of musical activity. He was also used to a mixed racial
    environment. Still in his teens when he got a job checking coats at a local
    dance club, he soon graduated to spinning records and talent-spotting for local
    radio DJ and aspiring producer Ray Ford.
    Lenaburg believed Phoenix could produce a soul scene every bit as vibrant as
    Detroit or Memphis, and he tried to make that belief a reality. He made his
    first recording with a group called the Newlyweds when he was only 16, and the
    B-side, ""The Quarrel"", became a local novelty hit despite being an
    unlistenable spoken word mess. The guys at Numero Group have included it as the
    last track on their Lenaburg retrospective, the latest in their amazing Eccentric
    Soul series, and it serves as a telling illustration of just how far he had
    come by the time he was regularly helming sessions in the late 60s.
    Much of this music was never properly released in its day-- though nearly
    all of it was worthwhile. Lenaburg started and folded several record labels--
    two only saw one release-- and never seemed to find the golden groove that
    could provide a real shape for the Phoenix soul scene the way Motown or Stax
    had for their cities. It's an interesting recorded legacy, though, one full of
    fantastic funk and soul tracks that sound dynamite rubbing up against each
    other on this compilation.

    Lenaburg's marquee artist was Michael Liggins, who cut a series of filthy
    funk sides in the late-60s, including the merrily lascivious ""Standing on
    the Corner"", a slamming cut in which he and his backing singers wile the
    day away ""standing on the corner watching all the foxes go by.""
    Liggins stuck with Lenaburg even during a long recording hiatus in the 70s (the
    time off came after a singer Lenaburg managed was killed by her husband just
    prior to a tour), and sings the latest track, a beautiful slice of sweet soul
    called ""Black & Beautiful"", based on Little Willie G's
    ""Brown Baby"".

    There were many more talents hanging around Phoenix, including Chicano soul
    band the Soulsations, represented here by two total stormers: A jerking,
    never-released attempt to jump the shing-a-ling bandwagon called ""Broadway
    Shing-a-Ling"" and ""Funky Nightclub"", a stone dancefloor killer
    with gritty vocals, twisting horns, and clattering, sample-worthy drum break.
    Fourteen-year-old Ronnie Whitehead is present both on his own as a convincing
    James Brown understudy-- ""Cold Feet"" is a blistering answer to
    ""Cold Sweat""-- and as a member of the Soul Blenders, a group formed
    by his brothers. Their ""Blending Soul"" rides a powerhouse groove with
    a fantastic bass line and pounding horn arrangement.

    It's a shame Lenaburg wasn't able to put together a true company around the
    acts he produced and managed, because this compilation makes clear that not
    only was there a lot of talent in Phoenix, but that Lenaburg himself was
    gifted. He wasn't a performer, but he wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on
    this disc, displaying a deep, spot-on grasp of funk and soul and a willingness
    to experiment. All the talent in the world doesn't matter, though, if all the
    tapes stay in the closet, and it's a true public service that this disc brings
    them out into the light for all to hear.

5061	17095	"At a Tame Impala show in Paris two years ago, Melody Prochet, French pop aficionado and multi-instrumentalist for the band My Bee's Garden, became intrigued by the Aussie psych-rockers' scuzzy sonics. She struck up a conversation with the band's Kevin Parker after the show about how he achieved the band's signature, blown-out bass sound in particular, and a while later he asked My Bee's Garden to support Tame Impala on a European leg of their tour. Though her own band's sound was clean and somewhat precious, Prochet remained drawn to the Tame Impala aesthetic. So when she decided to go solo, she asked Parker to produce, and to push her out of her comfort zone a bit. ""I tend to write songs with pretty chords and arpeggios, and I was kind of boring myself,"" she recalled. ""So I asked Kevin to destroy everything.""Mission accomplished. Recorded mostly at Parker's home studio in Perth, the resulting self-titled debut from Melody's Echo Chamber is a record of psych-tinged pop with just the right amount of thematic darkness and grime around the edges. Prochet has a way with melody and a voice that places her among the top-tier graduates of the Trish Keenan and Laetitia Sadier school of dream pop, but it's Parker's signature production that helps this record transcend its forever-in-vogue 1960s pop influences. (""This record was my dream sound,"" Prochet said in a recent interview. ""I've tried for years to get it but finally found the right hands to sculpt it."") Full of immersive textures that give off an echoey depth and prismatic riffs that tumble through space, Parker's production grants this record its own laws of gravity.The record's best songs tease out tension between soft and hard edges-- a combination of beauty and brittleness. Excellent lead-off single ""I Follow You"" pairs an exquisitely sugary melody with a fuzzy, syncopated riff, while the dreamy ""Crystallized"" detonates in its final moments into a kraut-y electro freak-out. Beginning with a toy-soldier beat and warmly warped synth tones, ""You Won't Be Missing That Part of Me"" blooms into one of the record's best moments, a kiss-off song that flips the usual script and takes the perspective of the heartbreaker rather than the heartbreak (""Because I lied with all my heart, because it's time to change my life... Hold on, you'll see it won't be that hard to forget me."") Parker's production is perhaps at its most stunning on ""Some Time Alone, Alone"", on which Prochet's arpeggios rain down like a chandelier being hit with a sledgehammer in slow-motion.The shards occasionally prick: ""Mount Hopeless"" is fittingly gloomy, and there's even a song about post-plane crash cannibalism called ""Snowcapped Andes Crash"". But for as odd and chilling as that song sounds on paper, it falls flat in execution, languishing on a Side B that doesn't quite have enough ideas or surprises to save from some repetitive lulls. Prochet hasn't quite figured out how to do anything interesting with the macabre that lurks somewhere in this record's sound, and it leaves you wishing she'd explored Melody's dark side a little more, à la Broadcast's creepy masterpiece Tender Buttons. Of course, Prochet's melodies can't quite fill the Broadcast-shaped void left in the wake of Keenan's untimely death, but Melody's Echo Chamber is one of the more satisfying records to bear that band's influence in recent years. For a collaboration between a songwriter and a producer who helped push her to the outer limits of her vision, Melody's Echo Chamber is an impressively immersive debut."
858	21842	For all the hot-pink light bathing 30-years-on memories of the '80s, that decade was full of dread—bad guys lurked around corners, and the threat of nuclear war hovered over the world’s geopolitik. 1999, Prince’s fifth album, opens with reassurance: “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt U,” a mushily robotic voice announces. “I only want U to have some fun.” The song that follows is the record’s title track, and with its lyrical laser focus on the world possibly ending, if not imminently then eventually, it fulfills that promise. Prince realizes the power of saying “Fuck it, let’s party” in the face of near-assured annihilation, a gesture that foments an effervescent, uncontrollable glee. (Which, here, is depicted by mashed-on keyboards and a joyously wailed policy of ejecting anyone who might be in a less-than-celebratory mood.)But we all die eventually, right? That’s the attitude that runs through much of 1999, which powers itself with machines like the Oberheim OB-SX and the Linn LM–1 while taking a slightly more sober view of the pleasures that dominated so much of Prince’s earlier work. Dangers—the bomb, “brand new laws,” sneering critics—get their airing, and time might be running out (Party over, oops!). Best, then, to get in all the good stuff while one still can, whether those feelings come from extended make-out sessions in the back of a slick car (the simmering “Little Red Corvette,” which emerges from a plume of smoke to become one of Prince’s most potent fusions of funk’s swing and rock’s swagger), late-night secrets about love and lust told among icy synthscapes (the stretched-out seduction “Automatic”), or Prince’s Holy Quadrality of Dance, Music, Sex, and Romance (the jittery “D.M.S.R.”).1999 is a sprawling double album (“D.M.S.R.” was cut from initial CD pressings to make it fit on a single disc) on which Prince indulged his curiosity in new technology, but what’s remarkable about it is how tightly-wound it feels, even on the more far-flung jams. “Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)” is claustrophobic and tense, Prince’s pleas to a lover who’s left him behind made even more frantic by the cacophony of digital sounds ricocheting around the mix. (It’s the song that probably brings Prince’s admitted influence of Blade Runner to mind the most.) “Lady Cab Driver” unfolds like a movie playing on fast-forward in Prince’s dirty mind, with a request for a “ride” turning into a bit of slap-and-tickle play before fading back to reality—as evidenced by scritching guitars and the reprise of the song’s feather-light hook.Then there’s “Delirious,” one of Prince’s most unbridled offerings, its wheezing keyboards sounding like a mind left alone to whirl, propelled by a dizzyingly upbeat drum track and Prince’s half-sneeze vocals. The one-two punch of that track and the Erotic City staycation “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” is enough to drive even the most buttoned-up listener to their own personal brink—one that arrives even before Prince murmurs, “I’m not sayin’ this just 2 be nasty/I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth/Can U relate?” Well. When U put it like that…It’s not all fun and sex games, of course; even though “1999” makes the idea of impending apocalypse alluring, the planet still goes kablooey when all is said and done. The piano ballad “Free” presents Prince in tender mode, smearing the personal and political together as he sings “Be glad that u r free/Free 2 change your mind.” The music grows increasingly stirring, with militaristic drums and fiercely slapped bass fighting for supremacy as Prince sings of creeping clamp-downs. And “All the Critics Love U in New York” takes the self-regard exhibited by the city and its more pretentious inhabitants and mashes it into a ball. But those forays into the wider world only give the more pleasure-minded tracks on 1999 more urgency and lightness.Prince played with different toys on 1999—new synths, new sexual frontiers, new paranoias. He bent them to his will, though, and this 11-song opus was the result. Balancing synth-funk explorations that would reverberate through radio playlists’ ensuing years, taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, 1999 still sounds like a landmark release in 2016; Prince’s singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities just enough created an apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps paradoxically, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.
9012	13017	"Just as there are many different ways to pronounce or butcher this group's somewhat awkward name, there are many different ways to view DD/MM/YYYY on their latest album, Black Square. If you start from the front of the record, then Marc Masters' description of their sound (in his write-up of the album's excellent lead-off track, ""Bronzage"") is the way to go-- ""think hyper math-punk with touches of prog and hardcore."" If you're listening to this on shuffle, and you happen to land on ""Birdtown"", you might think you've stumbled across an uninspired horn-loving synth-heavy instrumental combo. If the wild oscillations and rumbling hiss of ""Lismer"" tumble from your earbuds, you'll think these guys are spastic obnoxious noiseniks. The NES mating calls in ""I'm Still in the Wall"" (along with an earlier album's title-- Blue Screen of Death) might have you believe DD/MM/YYYY are card-carrying members of Bitpop Nation.In other words, Black Square covers a fair amount of territory over the course of 35 minutes. For better or worse, DD/MM/YYYY don't stay in one place for long, and they certainly don't keep still.  As the bookends of this album ably display-- ""Bronzage"" at the start, ""Digital Haircuit"" at the end-- DD/MM/YYYY can rein in their stylistic happy feet long enough to bang out infectious and spry post-punky tunes.  Most of the album features a fair number of similar songs that effectively encompass DD/MM/YYYY's disparate musical interests without seeming fussy or overwrought. Unfortunately, they try to mimic their stop-start rhythmic agility with the album's various stylistic shifts.  It's not so much that the changes of pace are unwelcome, but it's the way these changes are implemented that causes problems.The whip-smart call-and-response action in ""No Life""-- think Fugazi with pocket-protectors-- is abruptly cut off at the two-minute mark, careening listeners headfirst into the queasy shimmering torpor of ""'They'"" and a potential case of whiplash. Detours like ""My Glasses""-- a minute-long track of someone running their finger along the edge of vinegar-rimmed drinking glasses-- or the aforementioned ""Birdtown"" wouldn't be so bad if they weren't put back-to-back right in the middle of the album. These  bait-and-switch tactics do a lot to stall the album's momentum. In the case of the brake-slamming tempo change in ""Real Eyes"", it can gum up the works mid-song. And then there's an arcade-game-sampling instrumental to contend with before Black Square gets back to doing what it did back at the start. For folks willing to roll with the punches, or fans of the Mae Shi and friends looking for more of the same type of hyper-hopscotch, Black Square will be a highly enjoyable front-to-back listen.  But for folks expecting  more versions of what its first few tunes promise, the sardonic words of advice offered in the intro to ""$50,000 Guitar Head"" suffice as a fair warning: ""Good luck-- you'll need it!"""
6491	15577	"Lights Out is Kate Simko's debut album, but it comes more than 10 years into her career as a DJ and recording artist. Simko was classically trained on the piano as a child growing up in Chicago, but the music that caught her ear was coming out of the city's vibrant electronic music scene. Fascinated with the sounds she was hearing from Chicago house and IDM producers, she got herself some turntables and set to the task of learning to make this music herself. The music has since taken her to Chile, where she was half of the duo Detalles with Andres Bucci; back to Chicago, where she released a handful of singles and EPs, as well as the mostly ambient score for The Atom Smashers; and then to Buenos Aires, where Lights Out was born over the course of a year.Simko may have conceived the album thousands of miles to the south, but her formative Chicago house influence is certainly audible. The music is built firmly on a foundation of straight-ahead Roland beats-- nothing we haven't heard before, to be sure, but Simko has her own, often-engaging way of treating them once they're in place. Among her signatures is the way she wraps her basslines around the monolithic pulse of the kick drum. She keeps the bass tone as clean and shiny as new chrome and has a weirdly graceful way of integrating it-- it's like watching a cat sit down and slowly curl its tail around its front paws. This process is very easy to hear, because otherwise, Simko approaches her work with a minimalist's sense of space and patience, letting her club beats become mantras before introducing small changes.For instance, she waits until nearly halfway through ""Beneath"" to introduce a new chord change, but when she does, it instantly brightens the music. On vocal tracks ""Mind on You"", ""Had It All"", and ""Flight Into BA"", she uses her guest singers in much the same way she uses the rounded synth tones she's created, dropping them in at intervals as a way of evolving the music. ""Mind on You"", in particular, has a jazzy slide that the vocals almost get lost in. The one place where Simko works with messier sounds is ""Mira Vos"", which is invaded by strange synths that sound like doves cooing. All this adds up to an album that's strangely absorbing when you put it on in the background, but perhaps a little blank when you're paying close attention. You have to be in a mindset for minimalism when you listen to it, just as you would with Terry Riley or Philip Glass.If Lights Out has a failing as an album for home listening, it's a run of three tracks that each stretch past seven minutes. These three songs (""Cairo"", ""Bikini Atoll"", and ""Last Breath"") push the overall running time past an hour and simply aren't that interesting outside of a club context. You can hear how they might work in a dark room full of people who are there to dance, but they push the minimalist angle a little too far for passive listening. Outside of that, Lights Out is a solid debut, albeit one that will appeal primarily to listeners well within the core dance music audience."
4856	17352	"The ability to rap really quickly is a privileged skill in hip-hop, and mostly with good reason. Too often, though, rap fans get stuck in the pursuit of being dazzled, of being reminded why rappers can rap and we (often) can't. Ratking, a four-piece rap group from New York, is led by the 18-year-old Wiki, whose ""Wikispeaks"" single from earlier this year made minor waves across the web. Wiki, as he's likely been told countless times, sounds remarkably like a young Eminem when he raps, and his taut, elastic flow means he can actually do a pretty good homage. It's that flow that is his (and the band's) calling card, but the flair is mostly a distraction laid over the top of their Wiki93 EP, which reveals a group of kids still searching for something to say.The idea of having ""something to say,"" is itself a distorted one in hip-hop-- ""something"" doesn't always have to be life-altering truths. But having an identifiable point-of-view is almost always crucial to becoming a worthwhile rapper and to catching on with an audience. Ratking are nipping at the heels of a loose constellation of rap groups-- Odd Future, Death Grips, Joey Bada$$' Pro Era-- that have caught on in the last year or two by presenting new perspectives. Ratking come from a hardcore background (Wiki played Germs covers in high school) and are aesthetically guided by early-90s New York rap, but they have yet to progress beyond the facade of teen male angst. Even Odd Future, fellow skate-rappers who may be their most obvious peer in this regard, had quietly constructed a deeply nihilistic world unto itself. Wiki93 is for teenage punks, too, but there's nothing at the core of the EP that illuminates the inspirations of Wiki and fellow MC Hak. Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, for instance, bonded over their missing fathers, and that pain was unavoidable in their music. In Joey Bada$$ you can see an old soul, one who has absorbed old beats and rhyme schemes and comes at his music from a place of love. With Ratking, you catch snatches of images-- kids scrawling graffiti, jumping subway turnstiles, running from cops-- but there is nothing deeper. Wiki raps about things that kids do, but what's the significance? There is still some potential here, though. Ratking, four kids that call themselves ""mutts""  and are into punk, early-90s rap and Cam'ron equally, seem like a zeitgeist rap group in some sense, and in that they have an untapped power waiting to be harnessed. There is also an obvious level of talent: Wiki's ability to rap well from a technical perspective almost works against him, but it's still a dazzling skill that could one day be put to good use.There are also the beats on the album, cooked up by producers Sporting Life and Ramon. They are built from the ground up with hard boom-bap drums, but they attack with an aggressiveness and noise that sprouts from the group's roots in hardcore and punk. There is no dissonance, though, no skronk; they are beats made to be rapped over, but without a nod to the lived-in warmth and old crackle of typical 90s-revival productions.""To every mother with a stroller, eyeing me when I roll up/ Know your kid's gonna be just like me when he grows up,"" Wiki raps on ""Pretty Picture"" and in many cases it's probably be true. But Ratking are a group that are a very long way away from turning that into a rallying cry, from not just embodying disaffected teen rebels but speaking for them. Being able to really connect with that fanbase-- the one that turned the Beastie Boys, Eminem and Odd Future into heroes-- doesn't come easily, and it can't be papered over with a nice flow."
8999	13021	"It'd be stupid to call your band the Intelligence without showing signs of progress and evolution. And over the course of four albums, the now full-time project of ex-A Frames drummer Lars Finberg has loosened up its formative post-punk pessimism to the point that the band's chosen MySpace URL-- www.myspace.com/theworldisadrag-- feels more ironic with each record. Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on Fake Surfers, Finberg goes about creating a sanctuary from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast indie rock acts (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rational-thinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time.The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's Deuteronomy, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but Fake Surfers doesn't continue these new adventures in hi-fi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, Fake Surfers practically sounds like Dark Side of the Moon compared to Crepuscule With Pacman, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, half-formed material issued via French indie Born Bad.)Fake Surfers' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lo-fi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourine-rattled ""Taxman"" strut of ""Tower"" and bobble-headed harmonies of ""Universal Babysitter"" suggesting mid-1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging-60s go-go groove of ""Saint Bartolomeu"" and the circular circus melodies driving the electro-stroll of ""I Hear Depression"". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on Fake Surfers is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. new-wave hot dogs Wounded Lion's ""Pony People"" feels like the song Finberg's been waiting to sing his whole life. Lord knows what it says about the man that he's never sounded happier than when singing from the perspective of a centaur ""firing arrows into rabbits."" But in the case of Fake Surfers, such emotional breakthroughs are worth sacrificing a bunny or two."
16416	7187	"If infernal indie snobs ever create the fascist regime they seem itching for,
    and you find yourself death-marched through repeated listenings of Trout
    Mask Replica, you'll probably start fantasizing-- right around the 17th
    time through ""Pena""-- about the days when you were free to listen to bands
    like The Sinking Ships. Apres-garde though they may be, this California
    quartet has an assured knack for winning pop songs, performing them with
    all due gracefulness, as they demonstrate on this would-be contraband, Out
    of Key Harmony.

    The Sinking Ships add little to the basics of power-pop kept alive by the
    loving disciples of Big Star, but originality has never been a defining
    aspect of this genre. As Alex Chilton and Chris Bell watched prog-rock
    flower with jaundiced eyes, so, too, do the Ships turn away from a purportedly
    progressive world that tags a homophobic misogynist like Eminem the wave of
    the future. And why not; their wall-to-wall guitar jangle still sounds fresh
    and exciting, even after years of moderate-to-heavy usage.

    Vocalist Katie Conley (ex-Holiday Flyer) shows why great singing will never
    go out of style, anti-commercial diktats notwithstanding; the sonic melange
    centers around her, and for good reason.  Though her tone may be too pure
    for those enraptured by sweat and strain, she has an aching, lovely voice
    with superb control, and loads of coy sexiness. Conley fares well among the
    dense textures featured here, but in two moments during ""Complicate Everything"",
    when the accompaniment is stripped almost entirely away, she reveals nuances
    that are regrettably buried on the rest of the album. Even during the record's
    busiest moments, she still commands much attention, sounding equally impressive
    at her fieriest as in gentler passages.

    The rest of the band-- and Out of Key Harmony as a whole-- is decent,
    but tend to promise more than deliver. Their first handicap is an awkward mix,
    which suffocates everything that should be loud, and at crucial moments.
    Also, Matt Levine may be a fine rhythm guitarist, but his leads lack bite, a
    problem only intensified by the indiscriminately glossy production. The band
    could use some stinging ballast to balance their sugary tendencies, the way
    that Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd provided counterpoint to Matthew Sweet
    for his best work. Failing that, they could further pursue the subdued punk
    leanings that pop out joyfully in ""You Can't Push Me Away"" and ""Laughable"".
    Like Neil Young after Harvest, The Sinking Ships could head for the
    ditch and make things very interesting along the way, but as it stands, the
    band is only breezy at their worst, and thoroughly inviting at their best."
2843	19627	The backstory to Music from the Mountain Provinces positions it as a set of field recordings, all captured on tape during life-risking ventures into the Philippines during the late 1980s. David Blair Stiffler, a veteran documenter of uncommon sounds for the Folkways label, took a small crew into remote mountain regions of the country on three separate occasions spanning 1986-88, ultimately getting kidnapped at gunpoint and held for 18 days on their final journey. Incredibly, as documented in the liner notes on this release, Stiffler simply carried on recording while in captivity, although many of those works were confiscated by the rebel faction who abducted them. Despite such bravery, these recordings have never surfaced before, with the passing of Folkways head Moses Asch preventing their release at the time, and the reliable Numero Group now picking up the pieces many decades later.Like the best recordings of their type, Stiffler’s work here gives a strong sense of place. The natural world around the musicians is as important an ingredient as the instruments and vocals of the musicians he encountered. His use of space is important, too. On one track, simply titled “Man Whistling”, the recording takes in every breath of its player, making it feel like you're about three feet away while it was being played. Elsewhere, acres of room expand outward—on “Lullaby” the instrumentation is so distant it sounds like it’s a different song, being played somewhere else, in another time entirely. Sometimes chatter drifts in and out of the mix, or leaves crunch underfoot. It’s an interesting juxtaposition to the playing, which is often taut and disciplined. The ensemble of gong players that opens up the album makes it arresting right from the beginning, with tension and pace gathering quickly then loosening at the close.While working through Mountain Provinces it helps to have Stiffler’s liner notes to hand, to provide a sense of journey as he ghosts through various regions on his journey. He points out the political turmoil in the Philippines in 1986, discusses how these cultures struggled to maintain their identity at the time, and sets the scene by describing it as a mix of “spectacular landscapes and a cultural heritage of blood feuds and head hunting.” There are distinct phases to the record, with the July 1988 trip, for example, focussing on throat singers and other vocalists in a region around where Apocalypse Now was filmed. It’s appropriate they landed in a location once deemed filmic, as the problems around Mountain Provinces give it the air of something like Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo, which focuses on the struggle to pull a huge ship over a Peruvian mountain. Stiffler’s battle was more internalized but no less difficult, as he exited the region with recordings lost, his life just about intact, and with no end product to show until now.Moods shift dramatically across the pieces Stiffler and his team managed to capture, from the light and airy trio of “Bamboo Zither” songs to the positively doomy “Group Singing with Gongs”. On the latter there’s an air of creeping tension, a feeling perhaps easy to ascribe from an outsider's perspective when bearing in mind the political strife in the region at the time, but certainly hard not to notice as a cacophony of discordant gongs builds over its ragged course. Most striking is one of the few recordings to remain from Stiffler’s bout of captivity, which features a woman singing a lullaby to her baby. There’s tenderness and fear in her voice, especially when it descends into bouts of un-language, where the woman simply hums the melody of the song and her inflections beautifully rise and fall.Although Stiffler’s liner notes to this compilation are reasonably comprehensive, still some holes remain in the stories surrounding these songs. Mostly, we don’t get to find out how long they have been around, or how off-the-cuff the performances are. Some are undoubtedly songs passed down through generations, but whether they pick up different shades and colors as the times change remains a mystery. One such track, named “Rice Winnowing Song”, bears a dream-like quality, rendered by the layering of the women’s voices throughout. On “Rice Winnowing Song” it’s easy to drift off and forget the world, just as it’s easy to imagine the world impinging rather more heavily on material that becomes torn around the edges. The broad range of feelings captured is what gives Music from the Mountain Provinces its strength—this is a vivid snapshot of a particular place and time, with all its divergent moods bursting into life again after being lost for so long.

    French is supposed to be the language of love, those Lotharios who speak it achieving levels of pick-up artistry beyond anything The Game teaches. In that case, Montreal dance-rock trio We Are Wolves must've been off programming their synthesizers when they handed out romantic expertise, because for these Quebecois, courtship is anything but smooth and debonair. Testosterone helps make the male a lover, but it just as easily brings out the fighter, and WAW's post-apocalyptic dance tunes reflect this three-car pile-up between lust, rage, and romance. Don't bother asking these guys who they'd fuck, marry, or kill--the answer's always the same for each category.
    The band's solid debut, charmingly titled Non-stop Je Te Plie en Deux (""Non-Stop I Fold You in Two"" in English) carved its own niche within dance-rock's overcrowded market by heavily emphasizing the dirty and painful. Listening to the tweeter-frying synth lines and diesel engine beats, you'd sooner drop Tylenol Migraine than ecstasy if caught on the dancefloor. Though psychologically residual, WAW's sterile spin on dance music still lacked dimension stylistically, and Total Magique looks to transmogrify this one-trick pony.
    The band sticks to their guns. Just as Non-Stop's ""Little Birds"" more or less disemboweled ""My Sharona"", new track ""Magique"" mangles a ""Blue Monday"" bassline, with singer Alex Ortiz howling about the virtues of magic in French. Pounding opener ""Fight & Kiss"" establishes the album's ongoing relationship rollercoaster, capped by a lascivious Ortiz plea: ""Wasted all these years/ Wasted all these tears/ Come and kiss me."" Ortiz maintains his stubborn stance along with the band's stubborn kraut-infused dance on belligerent numbers like ""Some Words"" and ""Walk Away Walk"", but eventually they flash a bit of a soft side.

    In their own twisted way, WAW compose some alluring ballads here, patching together leftover scraps of noise to supplement their bizarre courtships. On ""Coconut Night"", a seldom-used guitar provides cocksure, almost AC/DC-like backing as Ortiz fumbles over lines about snakes and seas until a Cyrano whispers in his ear and he goes cornball: ""You are my coconut night/ My favorite place."" The nature theme continues on ""So Nice, So Cold"", a delicate electro paean to snow that ends with the near-Hallmark line ""I wish I could walk to the pyramids with you.""

    With these modifications, Total Magique proves a richer offering than WAW's debut, yet as the final three mostly instrumental tracks reveal, they still leave something to be desired texturally. Stripped of a pulsing rhythm or anguished vocal, these songs struggle to produce a worthwhile hook, and the trio's distaste for standard dance builds causes the tracks to flatline. Then again, WAW have never failed to deliver on their bread and butter, and asking for much more feels somewhat greedy. You want sleek, un-perverted dance music, go to a disco. These guys only pump out the vilest of the male condition, and Total Magique is an emotional train wreck that's hard to pull away from.

17546	4671	"Fuzzed-out drone-pop gets a bad rap from some quarters because it doesn't seem
    difficult to play.  People suspect that post-My Bloody Valentine shoegaze is
    more about shopping than musicianship, in that the skill lies in knowing which
    pedals to buy. Hell, guitar feedback in its most elemental form doesn't even
    require the player to, well, move, if you get right down to it. It's not
    a coincidence that the metaphors typically deployed for this kind of music are
    passive-- things like drifting, gliding and floating.
    But Sonic Youth's enigmatic Silver Sessions taught us that overdriven
    guitars tend to make an unholy racket when left to their own devices.  Turning
    feedback into something the man on the street can call beautiful requires careful
    manipulation of the never-ending electromagnetic stream. Notice that the
    seemingly passive verbs used above to describe shoegaze imply a subtle
    interaction with natural elements like water and wind. Movement here is a
    matter of channeling the base-level forces in a desired direction. I've always
    suspected that this had something to do with why Flying Saucer Attack was
    labeled as ""rural psychedelia""; David Pearce has spent his musical life dirtying
    his hands in distortion's black earth.
    Connecticut's Landing inhabits that amorphous space where time itself expands
    and contracts according to a delay pedal setting, and dream pop blurs into dream
    proper. Groups like Stars of the Lid and E.A.R. have wandered this same misty
    plane in search of the perfect drone, but Landing incorporates Bardo Pond's jam
    aesthetic into the journey, imparting a welcome communal feel to their lengthy,
    meandering compositions. Landing's effects-heavy guitar sound will not seem new
    unless you've been trapped under something heavy since 1992, but on Oceanless,
    they give convincing demonstration of why it has endured.
    The title of their second full-length has to be a joke, considering many guitar
    lines seem like heavily processed, six-string interpretations of whale songs.
    Like Windy and Carl's Depths (Landing have done a split record with the
    pride of Dearborn), these pieces unfold many fathoms down, in the slow motion
    required by immense pressure, allowing each ripple of sound to be examined in
    detail. Its six songs total more than an hour, and two of them stretch past the
    20-minute mark. Possibly because the pieces never strive to be proper ""songs""
    (a couple of whispers aside, it's an instrumental album), they never seem overly
    long, and most develop nicely from faint drones to epic crescendos and back
    again.
    This flair for drama is best exhibited on ""Are You Gone to Vast Arc Hues?,"" a
    live piece recorded in a Provo, Utah coffeeshop (near where the band was
    formerly based).  The opening drone whines like a siren, and then a melodic
    bass inspired by Galaxie 500 folds in, followed by an elongated implosion of
    guitar feedback. As the piece builds, the loose drumming becomes a key element,
    lending a slightly unpredictable pulse (another Galaxie 500 pointer?) that fits
    with the barely controlled howl. Around the ten-minute mark, the piece hits a
    long patch of pure shoegaze bliss, as overtones cluster and multiply like
    bacteria in a petri dish, and a dense fog of pure pink noise threatens. The
    song fades out slowly over several minutes, as the voices of the café eventually
    reclaim the space.
    Elsewhere, Oceanless hearken back to the more restrained, earthy sounds
    of earlier Landing records like the Centrefuge EP. ""Structure vs. Chaos""
    is an exercise in reverb and delay, as twin guitars serve mainly to set a variety
    of echoes in motion, and the resultant melodies seem both accidental and quite
    beautiful. ""How Did You Feel?"" represents the dark end of Landing's expression,
    with a sinister bassline reminiscent of Joy Division's ""Transmission"" (because
    of the tempo, it reminds me a lot of Low's cover), harsh guitar drones, and
    buried vocals that never approach comprehension. This black moment is the
    exception. Through most of Oceanless, I feel the ascension of the best
    drone music, the blissful high that comes from slowly converting force into
    movement."
7924	14135	"Bill Callahan's first live album reflects his approach to music. It's a 2xLP set (also available as a download, no CD), and the packaging is minimal-- two slabs of vinyl, no notes, and all credits and recording info are printed on the disc labels. The functional nature of the package says, ""The music is what's important here."" Callahan kicks off the album by mumbling, ""We're gonna get right down to business,"" and then he and the band-- guitar, bass, drums, violins-- proceed to do just that. It's 2007, they are in a small club in Australia, and Callahan is drawing from a catalog of songs any songwriter would envy. Turned out to be a good night.Though Woke on a Whalehart, Callahan's first album under his own name after leaving the name Smog behind, was just about to come out when Rough Travel for a Rare Thing was cut, the setlist focuses heavily on his previous full-length, 2005's A River Ain't Too Much to Love. Five of the 11 songs come from that release, with stops at Supper, the ""Rock Bottom Riser"" single, and Knock Knock along the way. There's one reach back to 1995's Wild Love (""Batheysphere""), and one tune from Whaleheart (""Diamond Dancer""). Heard together, with this band providing lean and effective accompaniment, the songs sound like they belong on a single album. Rough Travel flows. Callahan's voice, having grown richer and deeper over the years, is front and center, putting the focus squarely on the words and the way he phrases them. There's plenty going on there to keep things interesting.Indeed, Callahan's singing is a model of how much can be done with a limited vocal range. Sometimes he's half-talking and telling stories. Sometimes he's bending lines to put emphasis on certain words. Sometimes he's doing something close to a croon. In every case, his vocals are bound to the lyrics and reflect how he writes. The songs here are on the long side-- six minutes or so on average-- but it's not because Callahan wastes words. He knows when to leave space, and he has a way of making hard, clear images stay in your mind. When he sings a word like ""gold"" or ""river,"" you see the color and you can feel the water. Three words placed next to each other, like ""rock,"" ""bottom,"" and ""riser,"" the way he sings them, can tell a tiny story on their own, complete with a discernible arc. Performance and arrangements aside, Rough Travel, though not a ""greatest hits"" kind of set, affirms the authority of Callahan's songwriting. No wonder writers tend to love him.Though Callahan's focus can come across as remote and stoic, he can also be playful. Take ""The Well"", for example. Much of the song focuses on the narrator's obsession with a single drop of water clinging to the edge of an old bucket perched at the top of an abandoned well. It's not much to hang a nine-minute song on, but Callahan imbues the image with drama and gets in some funny lines along the way. ""Everybody has their own thing that they yell into a well,"" he sings, one of those lines of his that makes you think, ""Yeah, that feels right."" And he puts some echo on his voice as he runs down his: a hoot, a ""Hello?"", and a ""Fuck all y'all.""The instrumentation here is mostly acoustic, and the structure of the songs, including the traditional ""In the Pines"", which Callahan has covered on record and turned into something that feels like his own, lend a stately feel. But the songs are not easily bound to genre. Unlike his label-mate Will Oldham, whose loose rootsiness can lead to music that seems like it's drifting in from the past, Callahan's work seems of its time and makes you aware of the artist behind it. And Rough Travel, though ultimately only for established fans, turns out to be a very good snapshot of where that artist's music stood at the end of the last decade."
5487	16622	"From the start, the logo of KTL featured a thin inverted cross, intersected toward its bottom by a large ""X"" and paralleled by an arrow that broke open at one side. On the covers of the first several releases by the international drone-doom duo of Sunn O)))'s Stephen O'Malley and Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg, that insignia forced some shade of dark against another. On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for 2, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. O'Malley and Rehberg began KTL, after all, in order to score Kindertotenlieder (which shares a name with a Mahler piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which ""a group of teenagers get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert."" Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them. The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist Mark Fell adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic. The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of Tim Hecker, Christian Fennesz, or Yellow Swans should find entry points here, while the more minimal maneuvers of Thomas Köner and Keith Fullerton Whitman seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the gravity of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (O'Malley is a co-founder, of course, while Rehberg has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is expansive and sprawling, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very different performers. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a quarter-hour span that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the final piece here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", O'Malley and Rehberg finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the latest collaboration between American author Dennis Cooper and French puppeteer and playwright, Gisèle Vienne, the pair responsible for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of Jonathan Capdevielle as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show in French. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks. "
18072	5018	"Pitchfork University of Musical Criticism, Samir Hall, Hopkins, Minnesota, 2057A.D.

    Professor:  The basic crutch of the critic is simple comparison.  It is uninspired, yet
    inevitable.  The easiest way to describe band B [The Professor scribbles ""B"" on an overhead
    projector] is to compare Z to bands X and Y [""Y"" and ""X"" are similarly scrawled].  Now, the
    juxtaposition of X and Y are an immediate indication to the quality of band B.  Now, let's
    assume the difference between bands X and Y-- whether it be through genre or quality or time or
    geography-- is D.  Graphing /D/ with the X axis being D and the Y axis being the resulting
    rating, or opinion, of the critic, what you have is a typical parabola.  [The Professor
    scribbles crossing perpendicular lines with a giant ""U"" passing through the axis.]  As D, the
    difference between X and Y, increases, so, too, does the critic's love or hate of the record
    increase...

    Boy: So, wait, Professor...

    Professor:  Yes?

    Boy:  So, like, the bands X and Y, are they like the x and y axis of the graph?

    Professor:  No, I just coincidentally happened to name the variable bands ""X"" and ""Y.""

    Boy:  Oh, so it's the 20th century punk band from California, X, and the '40s one-hit wonder,
    Y, who had that big song, like, ""Y U B Treatin' Me B. A. D.?""  You're comparing those two
    bands?

    Professor: No, it's not that either.  They're just variables.  But it could, conceivably be
    those bands.  Now, please, if I may continue I can clear this up.  For example, let's say
    you're reviewing the new record by the Wickets.  Now if you write that the Wickets sound like
    a cross between Sepultura and Joan Armatrading, the reader infers that album is either very
    good or very bad.  Other examples would be, say, a cross between Kanda Bongo Man and Uriah
    Heep.  This is how you express a band's originality through juxtaposition.  Conversely, saying
    band B sounds like a cross between NOFX and Blink 182 isn't an endorsement.  Even when press
    kits say ""sounds like a cross between the Beach Boys and Beatles,"" it's typically a dead ringer
    for some rancid indie pop.  Now...

    Girl:  Professor Wisdom?  What happens if two bands actually do come together to form a new
    band?

    Professor:  Hmm, an interesting hypothesis, but of little concern.  Such things do not happen.

    Girl:  Actually, Professor, I was digging through the archive in the library and I found a
    review by DiCrescenzo...

    Class: ...  [A reverent moment of silence.]

    Girl: ...dating from 2000.  It's an album by Macha and Bedhead.  A collaboration.

    Professor:  Interesting.  What did he have to say?

    Girl:  He said it sounded ""like a cross between Macha and Bedhead.""

    Professor:  Hmm.  A rather unmotivated moment in his career.

    Girl:  Quite.  It's not even ironic.  Anyway, he says tracks two and three-- ""Never Underdose""
    and ""You and New Plastic""-- sound more like Bedhead where as tracks 1 and 4-- ""Hey Goodbye"" and
    ""Only the Bodies Survive""-- the album's best, borrow more from Macha's work. The last track is
    a Cher cover.  ""'Hey Goodbye' sounds like a cross between Radiohead and Indonesian shoegazer,""
    an obvious positive remark according to your system.  Indonesian shoegazer doesn't even exist.
    And the obligatory Radiohead reference, although overused, makes sense.

    ""Floods of zither and dulcimer rush up in the choruses,"" he continues.  ""Yet the exotic
    instruments are used more as enriching texture.  On Macha's solo releases, the Indonesian din
    wafts third world ambiance as if guitar necks, dulcimer hammer, and drumsticks were slowly
    burning incense sticks.  Yet, mulched upon Bedhead's sandman strumming, the effect is more
    ambiguously alien-- disconnected from images of eight-armed gods, woven rugs, and brass
    merchants.  'Sesame Street' writers and puppets weep as co-operation peaks in efficiency.
    Bedhead's beauty breathes more bizarrely, while Macha's fog slows to intoxicating speeds.  Both
    groups operate in the ethereal realm, and as music approaches its gaseous state, bonding becomes
    accelerated.""

    Professor:  That presents a completely different scenario.  I was assuming this on a solid
    state.  Ah, yes, but how different were Macha and Bedhead?  How big is D?  Little insight can
    be spilled on our dilemma without knowing this difference.

    Boy:  I believe it was 24 decibels.

    Professor:  A-ha.  Therefore, we'll plug that into our equation, and we get... 7.9.  The system
    is perfect."
2766	19653	“Let’s put apples in the lemon pie!” exclaims Jad Fair on “The Time Is Now”, one of the least-hinged songs on Half Japanese’s Overjoyed. It’s the legendary art-punk band’s first new studio album since 2001’s Hello, and in those intervening 13 years, he hasn't lost his knack for the charm offensive. “The Time Is Now” wobbles and wanders like a tranquilized tiger cub, with a meandering jangle threatening to tug Jad’s string of greeting-card pleasantries alarmingly off center. “I’m so glad you’re you,” he sings through his nose, sounding more like the punk-rock Mister Rogers than Jonathan Richman ever did.Richman is one of the few antecedents that went into Half Japanese’s protean stew of primitivist punk when the band formed in the '70s; avowedly amateurish and autodidactic, Jad and his brother David spun the blistering, shambolic rawness of their early singles into tooth-fracturing sweetness of their first masterpiece, 1980’s Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts (which featured, not so coincidentally, a Modern Lovers cover). Half Japanese is more infamous for the bands they’ve influenced, most notably Nirvana, although there’s a whole universe of lo-fi disciples tucked away in Jad’s back pocket. Overjoyed shows just how much Half Japanese, despite their reserved seat in the indie continuum, still exist in a hermetic dimension of its own. From the spiky, Voidoids-like jerkiness of “In Its Pull” to the slashing, sidelong surf riffs of “Shining Star”, the album views the rest of the musical world through a kaleidoscope and hears it through a tin can.That said, Overjoyed isn’t anywhere near as tinny as Half Japanese is known for. Produced by Deerhoof’s John Dieterich, it’s one of the most full-blooded and competently tracked albums in the band’s catalog. Even when “Meant to Be That Way” lurches off its axis thanks to an onslaught of wiggly, reverberating overdubs, the rhythm section is rock solid; barely a trace of lo-fi glory can be heard on “Do It Nation”, the album’s most distorted and self-destructive track. “Do it, do it, do it,” Jad chants like a bratty version of Malcolm Mooney over a droning, drool-inducing monochord. With maturity comes assuredness, but there’s a lack of desperate vulnerability to Overjoyed that renders it far less fetchingly fragile than its predecessors.There’s a scene in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 1993 documentary Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King in which the band is performing on a makeshift stage for the residents of Duplex Nursing Home in Boston (made famous by David Greenberger’s long-running zine Duplex Planet). While hatcheting their way through a version of Wilson Pickett’s “In The Midnight Hour”, one of the old men in the audience pulls a harmonica out of his shirt pocket and starts honking along, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do. Not to paint them as ancient or anything, but the brothers Fair are now closer in age to that old man than they are to the strapping young versions of themselves who forged milestones like Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts. In essence, Overjoyed is the sound of the Fairs playing along with themselves, or at least the sweet, weird boys they used to be—not always with as much spark or chaos, but mashing up the fruits just as gleefully.
11730	9876	"When Kristin Hersh plays live, she plays alone, sitting onstage and cradling an     acoustic guitar. She's also known to champion songwriterly     types like Vic Chesnutt. So it's tempting to view the Throwing     Muses and 50FootWave leader's solo career as an exercise in that same     sort of stripped-down song-centric purism, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. Hersh's lyrics might be intensely personal, but they're also vague     and elliptical; few of her words even     resolve as images, let alone scenes or moments or confessions. Her     melodies can sometimes be huge and overwhelming, but even then     they're somehow broken or tentative; she flits in and out of     choruses as it suits her, and rarely twists her songs to fit any     classical structure.Really, Hersh's songs are just as reliant on     bells and whistles as those of TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth, or any     other band that thoroughly integrates its effects-pedals into its     writing process. It's just that Hersh's one big special effect is her     voice, a singular instrument maybe best described as Betty Boop on     methadone. In Hersh's voice, strength, fragility, desperation     and resolve are all inextricably wrapped up in each other, like she     somehow takes comfort in her own confusion. That voice drove both the     Throwing Muses and 50FootWave, but on her solo records, it's allowed     to take over completely, to overpower and swallow everything around     it even as it sinks deeply into her arrangements.Hersh's voice remains the engine at the     heart of Learn to Sing Like a Star, her seventh solo album and first     for Yep Roc, but something else is missing. Hersh's previous albums     all came out on 4AD, and something of that label's tangled     goth-pop aesthetic bled onto them. She might not have been singing     about candles and lace, but the strings and acoustic guitars had a     couple of extra layers of reverb on them, and they'd build as her     voice got louder, giving some of her choruses a religious swoop that     wouldn't have been out of place on a Dead Can Dance record. Those     layered-up strings and pianos are still there on Learn to Sing, but they've been stripped of their woozy veneers, made     to saw and clank without any of the pillowy sustain they once had.Hersh produces the record herself, and she doesn't do her     compositions any favors. At times, she plays around with processed,     crunchy rock guitars or overdramatic power-ballad crescendos. It     sounds like she's been listening to the Foo Fighters or something; I     can't imagine what she was trying to do. Even more confusingly, she's     included a couple of spare, almost minimal instrumentals, all too     short to really add or detract anything from the album.Still, her voice has that edgy intimacy     it's always had, and sometimes the crashing strings even accentuate     it and build it into something huge. We can still     hear her fingers squeak on their guitar strings, and her lyrics often     still have a strangely elusive evocativeness: ""This place makes me     feel like I'm dead, haunting it."" And she's still as powerful a     presence as she ever was. But in her über-clean, compressed     production and arrangements, she's stacked the deck against herself     and prevented too many of her songs from breathing and pulsing the     way they should."
3471	18867	"In a BBC interview conducted last year in honor of the 30th anniversary of Aztec Camera’s High Land, Hard Rain, the band’s frontman Roddy Frame talked about how “Walk Out to Winter,” his favorite song on the album, drew from an odd jumble of influences. A fan of the 1977 punk explosion, the aspiring singer-guitarist was inspired by the spirit of the Slits and the Fall even as he began picking up on the clean-toned intricacy of jazz guitarists Wes Montgomery and Django Reinhardt. He also loved soul. In fact, as he confesses in the BBC interview, the silky chord progression of “Walk Out to Winter” was swiped from the Motown classic “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough"". Seeing as how Frame was 15 when he began writing High Land and 18 when he recorded it, “precocious” is a word that gets thrown around a lot. But the title of album’s opening track, “Oblivious,” could be read as equally telling. Flush with youth, Frame seemed blissfully unaware that these pieces weren’t supposed to fit together. Either that or he didn’t know it was supposed to make a difference.Frame wasn’t entirely alone. Orange Juice—Aztec Camera’s close comrades on the Glasgow indie label Postcard Records—had already combined some of these same elements before Frame made his Postcard debut, the 1981 single “Just Like Gold.” And the NME’s famous C81 cassette compilation included, alongside Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, Scritti Politti’s “The ‘Sweetest Girl’”, Green Gartside’s first foray into post-punk soulfulness. Rather than an outgrowth of grayish post-punk, though, Aztec Camera was a negative afterimage rendered in pastels. By the time “Pillar to Post,” the group’s first single for Rough Trade, came out in 1982, Frame and crew had become labelmates with another young quartet that featured jangling guitars, crooned vocals, and a snappy rhythm section: the Smiths.“Pillar to Post”, “Oblivious”, and “Walk Out to Winter” comprise the trio singles released off of 1983’s High Land, newly reissued in an expanded, 30th-anniversary edition. Even if they were the only good songs, the album would still be a milestone. But every track is stellar. Buoyant and joyous, yet italicized with clever melancholy, “Oblivious” is the most punchy of the three. Frame’s jazzy guitar runs and jubilant arpeggios add a jittery energy to his teenage angst. Unlike Morrissey, he doesn’t have a mean moan in his body. He doesn’t have Morrissey’s depth, either, but that’s easily overlooked when “Pillar to Post” saunters up with funk-pop hook and plants the thoroughly Smithsian sentiment “Once I was happy in happy extremes” on the lips like a stolen kiss. “Walk Out to Winter” is the most sophisticated of High Land’s singles. A whirling, bitterly cheery paean to the death of punk, as Frame explains in his recent BBC interview), it wonders where all the young miserablists of his generation will go now. Singing like a pimply, gum-chewing Glenn Tilbrook, Frame answers his own question.Singles aside, standouts abound. From the pastoral-folk guitars and jogging bass line to the saucy handclaps and modified Richard Hell line (“Love comes in slurs”), “The Boy Wonders” is more barely coded speculation about what happens when adulthood leaves a child-shaped void in one’s soul. Same goes for the pensive “The Bugle Sounds Again” and even the album’s naked, acoustic closer, “Down the Dip,” a pub-busker anthem that slides a hint of Frame’s leftist, Red Wedge politics—never very pronounced in his songs—in among an atmosphere of spilled pints. The reissue of High Land comes with copious bonus tracks, including the original single version of “Pillar to Post”, which sounds raw and robust compared to the album version’s clean, sharp shimmer. Of the three single B-sides included, “Queen’s Tattoo” is the most intriguing, a twangy, galloping romp that predates Morrissey’s first flirtation with rockabilly, the Smiths’ “Rusholme Ruffians”, by three years. On the other end of the spectrum are the 12” dance mixes of “Walk Out to Winter” and “Oblivious”. As curiosities go, they demonstrate just how pliable Aztec Camera’s riffs and rhythms were; as new-wave floor-fillers, they don’t hold a candle to any given album track by, say, Spandau Ballet. The handful of live radio sessions, on the other hand, capture a barely-legal Frame at his immaculate, brassy best.Following the success of High Land, Frame had to grow up quickly. He did so, but always in a good way. For the rest of the 80s, Aztec Camera became a more calculated concern, with a rotating cast of session musicians that would include everyone from members of Dire Straits to—perhaps inevitably—a future (if fleeting) guitarist of the Smiths, Craig Gannon. By 1986, the Postcard-inspired C86 movement was splitting the difference between Aztec Camera and the buzzsaw punks that preceded them. Frame responded by removing his own guitar almost entirely from the equation with Aztec Camera’s biggest hit, 1988’s “Somewhere in My Heart.” Despite a back-to-basics rally in the 90s, Aztec Camera folded in 1995; Frame, now fifty, still enjoys a respectable solo career. High Land is not only his first statement of intent as a songwriter, it’s his most innovative, his most influential, and his most timelessly vivid. Peaking early can be bittersweet, but the album is all the better for it."
10017	11694	"Earlier this year, Britain's Soundway Records returned to compiling West African music after a four-year break. Not that those four years were spent lounging about in their pajamas--they reissued 45s from Colombia, Barbados, Nigeria, and elsewhere in that time, put out a couple LP reissues of vintage Afrofunk albums by Sierra Leone's Geraldo Pino, and put together funky comps of music from Colombia and Panama. And the label's founder, Miles Cleret, also spent a lot of time in Nigeria laying the groundwork for a stunning series of compilations of the country's pop music.The first dropped a few months ago-- Nigeria Special, which focused mostly on highlife and assorted other mildly funky sounds from the 1970s over its two discs, was up to the extremely high standard the label set for itself early this decade with its Ghana Sounds and Afro Baby compilations. And now they've followed it up with two more discs, this time hitting the discotheque and the rock scene to bring some seriously funky music to a wider audience than it was ever afforded in its day.Like his compatriot Samy Ben Redjeb of Analog Africa, Cleret painstakingly researches every song he wants to reissue and tracks down the musicians, making sure to properly compensate them for using their work-- there's a whole crop of reissue labels popping up now that do this, and it's sort of mind-blowing that it took so long for it to become the norm. Soundway's refreshing ethics aside, the real reason to pay attention to them is simply that Cleret has such good taste-- his intrepid journeys into the heart of West Africa's record industry yield thousands of records, but he's good at being judicious with his track choices. You're getting the cream of the cream here, and your ears won't be the only parts of your body that notice.Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-1979 offers nine tracks of deep, quite well-produced groove-- by the late 70s, Nigeria was home to plenty of high-tech studios to give the country's musicians the sheen they required as they kicked their funk into a new disco gear. Cleret makes the unusual (for him) move of repeating someone else with his inclusion of Joni Haastrup's ""Greetings"", which previously appeared on Strut's now out of print Nigeria 70 compilation, but if you'd heard the song you probably would've repeated it too. This is one of my favorite Afrofunk tracks, with a great psychedelic intro featuring flailing flutes and distant calls from Haastrup that sets up an absolutely sick dancefloor beat that would require a truckload of mirror balls spinning in unison to do it full visual justice.Otherwise, Cleret goes way off the beaten path. I'm a huge fan of the SJOB Movement's first album (1970's A Move in the Right Direction), but I didn't even know they had a second one. Nevertheless, Cleret sources a slamming disco-funk jam with an avalanche of a synth hook called ""Love Affair"" from it. Bongos Ikwue & the Groovies' ""You've Gotta Help Yourself"" is four boiling minutes of wah-drenched guitars, jazzy trumpet, and lyrics that reference ""God Bless the Child"" in the chorus. T-Fire's ""Will of the People"" has some of the heaviest drums I've ever heard. This is definitely disco-era funk, but it's still very gritty-- you'd never mistake any of it for Silver Convention or Chic-- and the Nigerian bands tended to add liberal doses of jazz freedom and rock crunch to their dancefloor mixture.The opposite could be said for Nigeria Rock Special: Psychedelic Afro-Rock & Fuzz Funk in 1970s Nigeria, where the fuzz guitars, trippy vocals, and heavy riffs are spiced with liberal doses of bottom-heavy rhythm. Nigeria's rock scene rose mostly from the campuses of the nation's universities in the wake of the Biafran War, and the bands came from all over the country but were especially common in the East, which had suffered the most from the war. The members of BLO (it was an acronym of their first names) had played with Ginger Baker in Europe for a few years, as had Joni Haastrup, whose rock band Mono Mono is also featured here. These were two of the country's biggest rock bands, and BLO closes things out here with ""Chant to Mother Earth"" (another Nigeria 70 repeat), a slow, lysergic crawl toward some sort of bliss, chemically-induced or otherwise.There are a couple of nasty psych-funk instrumentals, including Ofege's ""Adieu"", which has a great organ lead and a fantastically tangled guitar solo-- Ofege was a very prolific band, and their Higher Plane Breeze album provided one of the Nigerian rock scene's iconic images with its cover shot showing one member squatting amongst his bandmates, middle fingers raised high and proud toward the camera. If you're a dedicated collector of this music, you'll recognize the names Tunji Oyelana, the Funkees and Ofo the Black Company (the heaviest of them all), but it's amazing how many utterly obscure but great bands Cleret turns up here. The Hygrades? Colomach? Tabukah 'X'? The Elcados? These are not familiar names, even to collectors.None of those unknowns disappoint, either. The Hygrades' ""In the Jungle"" is a dynamic heavy funk-rock instrumental with a brilliant guitar part played by Goddy Oku-- the guy made his own guitars and the wounds he could squeeze from them recall Hendrix at times, but with Carlos Santana's pinpoint tone control. The Elcados' ""Ku Mi Da Hankan"" has a great, breezy three-against-four rhythm, Colomach, who were actually a Malian band visiting Nigeria, offer a strange, minimal psychedelic chant with an Afro-Cuban rhythm, and Joe King Kologbo & His Black Sound mix hectic traditional rhythms with a heavy psychedelic chorus for a truly singular track. The most explicitly rock track, Question Mark's ""Freaking Out"", is still pretty funky, but it's definitely an oddity-- the vocalist sounds like he could have sung for the dB's, and there's an almost punk edge to the playing.If you're already a fan of funky West African music, I recommend these sets to you without reservation. Go get them. More broadly, anyone into funk in general or the subtle permutations of vintage global pop music would be well-advised to dig this as well. From the royalty structure to the sound to the packaging to the research and of course the music, Soundway gets it right on these compilations. Afrofunk fans could hardly have asked for more."
8701	13304	"Tim Buckley was only 20 years old when he took a chair in Israel ""Izzy"" Young's shop and played a show for the small crowd seated on the floor among the racks of periodicals, books, LPs, and instruments hanging on the walls. This was the Folklore Center, recently relocated from MacDougal Street to Sixth Avenue, as if physically representing the gradual dispersal of the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1967, Buckley was not a household name (nor would he ever be); he had released a mannered debut on Asylum the year before, and had a follow-up scheduled for a few months later. At that point, he was a young artist still developing his sound and style, still honing his lyrical and vocal gifts.Although he had spent a few years in New York City before returning to Los Angeles, Buckley was closely associated with the West Coast scene, which was the reason Young booked him: ""I'm presenting concerts again so I can hear what a West Coast singer sounds like in person,"" writes Young in the liner notes to the new Live at the Folklore Center, NYC – March 6, 1967. Buckley must have been a novelty on the monthlong Folklore Center Continuing Folk Festival, the odd man out among New York natives Jack Elliott, Art Rosenbaum, and Spider John Koerner. But he was no more a Laurel Canyon strummer than he was a Village folkie and in fact adopted the brittle composure of the British folk at its stiffest on his debut.There are traces of that formality on Live at the Folklore Center, but it is usually obscured by the influence of Bob Dylan, Fred Neil, and other East Coast singers, which is more obvious on this record than on any of his studio LPs. These are stark recordings of skeletal songs, featuring just Buckley's bell-like voice and emphatic, often percussive guitar playing. The sound quality is good, which is unexpected considering the performance was recorded through one mic on a machine used for taping field recordings. On opener ""Song for Jainie"", ""Wings"", and especially ""Aren't You the Girl"", Buckley conveys the conflicts and romantic recriminations as strongly and surely by himself as he did with a full band and string section on his debut, and ""No Man Can Find the War"" flourishes in this context, the strident strumming and descending melody on the chorus sounding like damning judgments.Live at the Folklore Center is a document of the artist pulling away not just from the New York scene or the West Coast scene, but from every scene. With each record, Buckley put an increasingly distinctive stamp on his songs, saturating them in jazz, raga, psychedelia, rock, and even schmaltz (ever heard his cover of Tom Waits' ""Martha""?). ""Phantasmagoria in Two"" and ""Carnival Song"" point in that direction, even if they feel a bit unformed at this point. On the other hand, his relatively conservative reading of Fred Neil's ""Dolphins"" sounds much less affected than the version that would appear on 1973's Sefronia.What makes this recording more than a milemarker in an unpredictable and truncated career is the tracklist itself: Of the 16 songs Buckley played that night, six have never been officially released in any format, live or otherwise, until now. That the show ends with four such discoveries gives a sense forty years later of the artist embarking into the unknown, starting with the juxtaposition of his delicate vocal melody against his spidery, almost sinister guitar playing on ""Cripples Cry"". ""If the Rain Comes"" never pours, but ""Country Boy"" is a strong stab at country folk, and Buckley sounds like three or four different singers trading off vocals on ""I Can't Leave You Loving Me"". It's a climactic performance that shows both what Buckley had been and what he would become."
17807	4234	"A mold used in casting needs to be the precise spatial opposite of the
    desired object. If you want a piece of iron that looks like a human
    foot, you need a mold with empty space shaped like a human foot. It's
    obvious-- as the material is cast, matter becomes space and space
    becomes matter. This image comes to mind as I listen to Jan Jelinek's
    Loop-finding-jazz-records; this album is like hearing the mold
    used to cast proper pop. It's a perfect inversion of conventional music,
    a sonic negative. Everything that would typically be foreground is moved
    back or pushed off the screen altogether, and the flecks of sonic debris
    that would normally be covered by other sounds are left to carry the
    melody and rhythm.

    These thoughts came to me the first time I heard ""Do Dekor,"" which I
    would swear is the negative image used to imprint the ""AFX Fast Mix"" of
    Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me."" The rhythm is just as relentless (and
    nearly identical, beat-wise), but Jelinek's percussion of choice is not
    drums or even a drum machine, but tiny rips of static pasted into place.
    Taking the same idea even further is ""Them, Their"" which uses a single
    microscopic click as a substitute for a snare drum, as the full bass
    outlines a funky rhythm a half tick from hip-hop, and dreamy out-of-tune
    keyboards seem lifted from some distant memory. It's so computerized it
    hurts.  And yes, it's fucking gorgeous.

    The title here is meaningless, a joke coming from a guy who named a
    track on one of his records (under his Farben alias) ""Live at the Hollywood
    Bowl."" Some of the noises here may well have been sourced from jazz records,
    but you'd never know it. Besides, the palette here is similar to Jelinek's
    last album as Gramm, even though the goals are quite different. Gramm's
    personal_rock (which you should definitely check out if this record
    interests you) was more intent on exploring Jelinek's microsound ideas
    in the context of 4/4 dance rhythms-- something Loop-finding-jazz-records
    only touches on with ""Rock in the Video Age"" and ""Tendency."" With these
    tracks, Jelinek works territory similar to Wolfgang Voight's Gas project,
    anchoring his amorphous textures with the familiar house groove. The bulk
    of Loop-finding-jazz-records is given over to a more idiosyncratic
    pulse, which sheds more light on what Jelinek is doing with his peculiar
    mixing ideas.

    That Jelinek would create his deep anti-pop for Stefan Betke's ~scape
    label makes sense, as Pole is definitely the most apparent reference
    point. Though his ideas are similar to a degree, Jelinek has far surpassed
    Betke in terms of expressiveness. Among the current spate of glitch artists,
    Germany's Jelinek designs his tracks with an ear for emotion. Part of this
    comes from the textures he chooses, which veer toward the liquid and
    organic, and part of it has to do with the manner in which Jelinek operates.
    The natural inclination with music this minute and detailed is to pay very
    close attention to the individual sounds, and a palpable intimacy emerges
    from the listener's proximity. Call me what you will, but I find this album
    to be incredibly sensual. It's like lying naked in a bed of freshly washed
    flannel sheets, rolling back and forth, feeling massaged by every strand of
    cotton. This is the real digital love, baby."
17374	7919	"It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on
    vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the
    pre-release teaser for Hoshi No Koe, featuring the
    catchy single ""Sign,"" along with an a capella version (not
    available on the CD release), another new track, and a
    lengthy collaboration with some post-rock guys from Chicago.
    But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so
    that the bonus CD-ROM, an animated video of ""Sign"" by cover
    artist Katsura Moshino, could be completed. To make the CD
    more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added ""Meteor,"" a
    single taken from the now deleted 12"" that was Takemura's
    Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the
    stunning b-side ""Wax and Wane"").
    Those who knew Takemura only through his deadly serious (and
    often brilliant) Scope album were probably shocked by
    the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored ""Sign""
    on Hoshi No Koe. Here was a single heavily indebted to
    the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on
    an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a
    bridge. The deliberately clumsy electrobeat rhythms are
    augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed
    it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its
    sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in
    this context, that of sunny twee-pop. I like it quite a bit.
    Those only familiar with Scope may have been shocked
    by ""Sign,"" but ""Meteor"" is the piece that first showcased
    this side of Takemura's personality. Though it serves as the
    prequel to ""Sign,"" ""Meteor"" is in some respects the greater
    achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the
    Takemura oeuvre. It starts with a cloud of clicks and slides
    before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the
    one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced--
    some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't
    quite hold it together, a random assortment of beeps and
    honks, and eventually, a disjointed ska rhythm. As the
    individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh,
    instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining
    interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about
    three minutes into ""Meteor,"" everything starts to gel as the
    piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in
    a brilliant crescendo. ""Meteor"" is like a musical jigsaw
    puzzle, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's
    exhilarating and supremely satisfying.
    Unfortunately, ""Meteor"" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that
    mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a
    bit thin. For all his talents, Takemura is not the greatest
    editor, a trait also demonstrated here on the 35-minute
    collaboration with Casey Rice, Bundy K. Brown, Doug McCombs
    and John McEntire called ""Souvenir in Chicago."" I like
    sections of this piece. The first third has an impressionistic
    quality that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've
    heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback,
    terse bass melodies, and Takemura's rich synth chords and
    processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and
    Takemura indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again,
    sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to
    tell what relationship, if any, these shapeless sounds have
    to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his
    processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the
    other players and the interest level again rises, but overall,
    this track is just too long and impenetrable.
    ""Cogwheel"" is another interesting builder in the vein of
    Hoshi No Koe's ""Anemometer,"" but the lighter tone
    allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine
    minutes, it's still too long, though). The bonus video is
    nice, pretty much capturing exactly what you'd expect the
    world of ""Sign"" to look like, with the flatness of the early
    Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with
    brilliantly rendered characters. But I don't really understand
    these bonus CD-ROM things-- I guess some people sit in front
    of their computers and watch them or something. Overall,
    ""Sign"" is another interesting release for devoted Takemura
    fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still,
    it'll do while I pine for the next full-length."
34	22711	When something gets tagged as nerdcore rap, the implications are clear: this is for the Star Wars diehards, the sub-Redditors worried about the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s continuity with canon, or as Alex Trebek once put it on “Jeopardy!,” “losers.” It’s less MF Doom coolly retconning a comic supervillain into an enigmatic rap persona, and more Childish Gambino’s “Freaks and Geeks.” Nerdcore rap evokes the awkward and gangly, completely at odds with traditional rap bravado but still unknowingly, clumsily pantomiming its gestures nonetheless. To a point, it has long been insinuated that nerdcore rap is mostly just a safe space for introverted white males to write artlessly hypertechnical verses of Guardians of the Galaxy fan fiction and the like.Enter Sammus, a Cornell PhD student and rapper/producer named for the Metroid heroine, making what she calls “black girl nerd rap.” Her strongest work to date is Pieces in Space, a weird and confessional collection of songs about being weird and confessional. Sammus’ music represents an under-reached subset of geek fandom: it’s made for black feminists trying to quietly coexist in the gaming and comic subcultures. But as the recent GamerGate scandal proved, this can be a culture of sexism and anti-progressivism, and it exists within a larger world that already belittles and diminishes black women specifically. Sammus’ writing converges at the intersection of race, womanhood, sexuality, and nerdiness, doing so with a subtlety lost on most in the subgenre, who rap like they’re mashing every button on a controller at once to do a combo. She’s just as influenced by hardcore nerdcore trailblazer Mega Ran as she is Kanye West. Sammus is a passionate idealist and craft-first poet, penning the kind of wordy marvels that rap annotator types fawn over; she is self-described as “living in the land of keystrokes and passwords/Cheat codes, amiibos, and actors.”On the surface, the reference points for Pieces in Space are obvious and in keeping with the subgenre’s framework, dealing primarily with characters in the geek lexicon: MMOs, Nintendo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Sega with mentions of Loki, Luke Cage, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lakitu, and Majin Buu. But a closer reading reveals understated and sharp critiques about the ways we relate in the digital age, and how they often rob us of true connection. In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by anonymous lynch mobs of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us.On “Comments Disabled,” a tightly-coiled chronicle about the pervasively toxic and antagonistic internet culture that now extends all the way to the White House, Sammus dismantles trolls. “I’m thinking you should invest in collecting a best friend,” she raps, “Who won’t let you press send/To someone you just met/Through Twitter or Sirius XM.” On “Perfect Dark,” she examines the lack of women of color in comics, games, and anime, sending a simple message: black girls want to have heroes, too. Alongside Jean Grae (a skilled lyricist who herself is named after a comic hero), “1080p” finds Sammus writing about the hardships of balancing grad school, an indie rap career, and interpersonal relationships when trying to communicate emotions through phone and computer screens, an idea fittingly conveyed by the concept of seeing things in higher resolution.What unfolds in Pieces in Space is a tale of personal identity and perspective that provides interesting insights on micro and macro scales. Sammus paints a complete and complex self-portrait while exposing truths about the subculture she wades through, and the greater world at large. She’s a ferocious and thoughtful MC whose flows call to mind the solving of a Rubik’s Cube, especially on songs like “Headliner” and “Genius.” Her hooks can leave something to be desired; they’re usually too long-winded and chewy to be earworms, sticking out like sore thumbs. But at any given moment, she’s liable to rattle off a bar like “Gotta spit so sick that you drain Big Pharma/Get your skin so thick you don’t get stigmata” on “Cubicle.” She’s as likely to rap about phosphates and integers as she is to name-check Serena Williams or Emmitt Till. Her delivery is piercing, her perspective refreshing. She ends up becoming the role model she once set out to find.
4519	17801	"Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers was a media phenomenon before anybody had seen so much as a promotional still. For starters, Korine, the mind behind cult classics like Gummo (his directorial debut) and Kids (he wrote the screenplay for Larry Clarke's film), cast Hollywood wildcard James Franco as the uncannily RiFF RAFF-like rapper/dealer Alien while Gucci Mane makes his screen debut as his drug kingpin rival. Meanwhile, Korine tapped Disney Channel star Selena Gomez as the conflicted Spring Breaker, Faith, and former High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens as the reckless, dangerous Candy. An early teaser features the leads belting out Britney Spears' ""…Baby One More Time"" and that's not the only (nor the most memorable) Spears homage in the movie. And then, to top it all off, Korine hands the soundtrack to EDM figurehead Skrillex, a former Warped Tour band member turned posterboy for dubstep's more malignant cliches.It's clear from the opening credits of Spring Breakers-- the most cartoonishly turn't-up Spring Break scene you could possibly imagine, accompanied by the drop-heavy debauchery of Skrillex's calling card ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites""-- that Sonny Moore was the man for the job. His music, old and new, serves as the spine of Spring Breakers, a compilation that also features carefully selected rap tracks and his remix of Birdy Nam Nam's ""Goin In'"" along with contributions from electronic musician and soundtrack veteran Cliff Martinez. The latter, who also steered 2011's well-received and similarly tense Drive OST, is a critical presence. Both musicians contribute their own ambient-leaning, instrumental originals to the soundtrack-- Martinez handles the curious, searching electronic interludes ""Pretend It's a Video Game"", ""Your Friends Ain't Gonna Leave With You"", and ""Never Gonna Get This Pussy"", while Skrillex handles the relatively more aggressive textures of ""Ride Home"" and ""Park Smoke""-- but the fiber of Spring Breakers is the sonic influence that they have on one other.Skrillex, in particular, benefits from Martinez' presence. Though Moore has recently attempted more laid-back approaches to composition, songs like ""The Reason"" didn't sound as idiosyncratically him, and don't prove as captivating or recognizable as his contributions here. The new music, stitched between previously released tracks (like Skrillex's ""With You, Friends (Long Drive)"" and Gucci Mane's Ferrari Boyz cut ""Young Niggaz""), achieves an important headspace for both the dramatic arc of the film as well as the soundtrack as a piece of music. Between the blurry revelry and the careening rush of consequence borne of violent impulse, Spring Breakers is all about the state between that original drug-fueled adrenaline burst and the depressing comedown crush. By cleverly interspersing the soundtrack with their original arrangements, Skrillex and Martinez successfully find that headspace throughout.Most importantly, Spring Breakers teases out the connections between songs that would be difficult to hear otherwise, offering new entry points. Take Waka Flocka's ""Fuck This Industry""; on Flockaveli, the track comes across as repentant and desperate, a song that finds a self-doubting Flocka siphoning out his signature bellow in favor of a restrained, contemplative whisper. Here, it serves as a momentary sense-collecting pause before the chaos. By leading into Martinez pieces, Skrillex's ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"" gains a pensive new tone, a fresh context that's only underlined by the orchestral back end redux of that track, as well as the Martinez/Skrillex sequel ""Son of Scary Monsters"". On Ferrari Boyz, ""Young Niggaz"" is known as one of the only tracks where Gucci and Waka didn't sound totally asleep, but here, it's a flag-bearer for shaking away the dark thoughts and getting back to the party; after all, it's spring break.There's a turning point of the film, where some characters decide they're overwhelmed and scared by this neon fantasy world and others find it all the more captivating. The question arises: Do we leave the party, or stay? Given its relatively seamless mesh of spiky, aggro party music and the more contemplative electronic moments created by Martinez and Moore, Spring Breakers is the rare soundtrack that covers both extremes and makes it work as a whole."
11517	10084	"
    The 1997 Matador release of the still-great Fantasma established Cornelius (Keigo Oyamada) as the far-East posterboy for indie-rock globalization.  As the most recognizable representative of downtown Tokyo's Shibuya-Kei movement (also responsible for Pizzicato Five, Buffalo Daughter and Fantastic Plastic Machine), Oyamada’s Beck-like star potential and wildly creative imagination led to a stateside buzz all-too-rare for Japanese musicians.  But a release schedule that includes five-year windows between albums isn't the best way to maintain hype.  It was 2002 before the follow-up Point boiled Fantasma down to its essence: a wonderful fusion of rubbery, acoustic micro-house rhythms. With another five years now having passed, Sensous represents yet another step forward for Oyamada’s unique headphone pop.  It’s not quite the departure that Point was from Fantasma, but it feels like a natural next step.
Sensuous opens with Oyamada revisiting one of Point's main techniques:  composing songs with the individual sounds kept clearly separate. His fascination with the hi-fi stereophonic demonstration records of the 1950s and 60s-- the ones that presented the full range of the stereo spectrum through whirring, buzzing sound experiments-- finds its full and rewarding realization here, but in function more than form.  Often on Sensous, as on Point, it often feels as though Oyamada starts by writing
    normal songs, but then inserts sounds into the places where there are none,
    erases the original melody, and keeps the music's negative.
    The title track is a meditative series of plucked guitar
    strings-- not completely unlike something you'd hear on Four Tet's Rounds-- phased between the left and right channels. But this initial sense of serenity quickly gives way to the more recognizable bustle of ""Fit Song"".  It replaces the sonorous acoustic with the muted, clipped strum of an electric guitar, which provides the rhythmic bed for the first minute of the song, as bass drums and hi-hats bounce around with Oyamada’s single-word incantations (""just,"" ""fit,"" ""click"").  The song feels like a stylized metropolitan soundtrack, but its video (which is included on the disc) suggests a more modest milieu that reflects the song's senses of humor and wonder. Syncing the movements of typically inanimate objects to the music, the video, like the album, is indulgent and geometric: sugarcubes form steps for a pair of spoons to climb, toothbrushes dance in a circle, the contents of a coin purse form a floating infinity symbol.

    ""Fit"" also marks the record's first appearance of Oyamada's favorite instrument of late (and, it should be noted, a point of friction for many listeners): a spacy, sonorant synthesizer that provides a soft and windy counterpoint to the skipping stones all around it. Later on the irresistable ""Beep It"", the synth serves a new-wavier rhythmic purpose, with Oyamada's monosyllabic mojo more resembling the sounds of a retro-futuristic aerobics class, and ""Music"" gradually introduces the instrument into its melange of chirping guitars and melismatic vocals, lending the song a fluffy, space-age buoyancy.

    Sequenced after the copy-machine-sampling ""Toner"", ""Watadori"" feels like an extended fever-dream from a nap under an office desk. Multiple layers of soft-jazz guitar tick off and ascend higher and higher, coalescing into busy-but-gentle treble-buzz, the equivalent of twenty different CTI-label records played at the same time. Oyamada's newfound predilection for the oft-criticized and elevatored music is most fully realized on Breezin'"", an inventive interpolation of the jazz-pop standard made famous by Gabor Szabo and later, George Benson. The song feels like perfect source material for Oyamada to work with, and while he thoroughly launders it of its core melodic structure, he manages to maintain its, well, breeziness. Like an installation piece on a constant loop, ascending three-note synth runs and chimes provide a chilly melodicism as the song works its way, over and over, to a surprisingly lilting payoff. Its doppelganger, ""Gum"", emerges later, with his vocals ping-ponging over a punk-metal guitar drone previously explored on Point's ""I Hate Hate"".

Sensuous ends with a second, even less-expected cover: a faithful update of the Rat Pack standard ""Sleep Warm"", on which Oyamada augments Frankie and Dean’s maudlin sentimentality with his own vocodered vocals and loud, trilling synth flourishes.  While this version certainly would be tough to fall asleep to, its album-closing position makes it feel more like a film-closing credit roll, similar to The White Album’s ""Good Night"".  Now, apparently, we just have to wait five more years for the sequel.

8379	13703	"Real Estate were born in the depths of one New Jersey summer. Frontman Martin Courtney had just returned home to his native Ridgewood from college in Washington State, a few fresh songs in his pockets. He'd been playing music with bassist Alex Bleeker and guitarist Matthew Mondanile since high school in various forms, even covering Weezer and the Strokes records from tip to tail. But during the summer of 2008, Real Estate didn't get nostalgic for just their specific suburban nights, crushes, or favorite bands as teens-- they fashioned a tin can-and-string to memories more universal. Their self-titled debut LP is a collection of those first underwater pop songs and onward, 7"" cuts and mpfrees that have been backstroking their way across the Web and into lo-fi nerdpiles. Over the past year, many of these songs have soundtracked a time when it feels like every kid in or just out of college seems to be handcrafting/clamoring for music that shuttles us back to a time before career choices, adult responsibility, and this recession.And while the Jersey Shore has clearly become the beating heart of their current aesthetic, Real Estate captures a rock band several lengths ahead of the fuzzy beach bums with which they pine. Real Estate share tones with North Jersey indie rock titans Yo La Tengo and the Feelies, pouring those influences through warm impressions of oldies radio. Riffs are cyclical and massaged, harmonies familiar. Each song is dunked in reverb and delay, though always with serious restraint. Most importantly, all boast architecture that still allows for swaths of jamming, the feeling that every measure's unfolding as easily as life ought to.""Atlantic City"" is a fitting entrance point, an instrumental that lopes along on a humid bass line before Courtney and Mondanile (the mind behind the cassette adventures of Ducktails) begin gently braiding together strands of trebly surf guitar over Mexican güiro. Single ""Beach Comber"" keeps things light as Courtney looks for meaning in the sand while Mondanile pokes around with his Strat. The bedrock here (see ""Fake Blues"") is almost krautrock-y in the way each layer repeats itself, a bent that might prove too drowsy for some. But as is the case for much of the experience, Mondanile adds classic rock sugars throughout, taking off on a solo at the three-minute mark that unbuttons everything really gracefully.Elsewhere, ""Black Lake"" is a gorgeous waltz whose slide recalls Modest Mouse's late-1990s take on the 1959 Santo & Jonny classic ""Sleepwalk"". Because Courtney's croon can be tough to make out at times, those watercolor frequencies lend that overwhelming sense of longing real grip, jam passages often more evocative than spaces that feature vocals. Nowhere on this debut is that better absorbed than on midpoint palate-cleanser ""Let's Rock the Beach"" or the six-minute shimmer of ""Suburban Beverage"".With the exception of the limp ""Pool Swimmers"", every part remains remarkably crisp. But what sets Real Estate apart from the rest of the herd is how evergreen its beauty can be. Despite the summery song titles and the beach balling associations that might follow these guys around, this music transcends the notion of seasons. Inside the overcast tenor of ""Black Lake"" and the airy upstrokes of ""Green River"", there's much more at play here than what goes on between the months of June through September. And impressionism aside, this is a band whose chemistry and technical gifts suggest there's more coming down the pipeline: more good times to be soundtracked, and more songs and records and sounds to communicate exactly that."
6607	15485	"The Unthanks are an English folk group led by sisters Rachel and Becky Unthanks. That's their real family name. Though they were born, seven years apart, in the small, Northern English county of Tyne and Wear, they now call Northumberland home. They sing in a regional dialect and with regional accents, and they also organize residential ""singing weekends"" through their website, traditional holidays that include ""singarounds and workshops, short coastal walks, singing in the pub and food to write home about."" They're serious about singing.There is much cultural reference, mystery, and beauty to be found on Last, a lot of which can't be untangled by Google. The opening ""Gan to the Kye"" is a beautiful example, a piano-based standard about a plot, cattle, and a dead collie in the fields. Its titular refrain is a reference to an old plural word for ""cows."" Equally heart-breaking is ""The Gallowgate Lad"", a flowing, six-minute tale of a wayward militia man, sung from the perspective of a concerned lover. And then there's the seven-minute ""Close the Coalhouse Door"", a song whose slurry of fiddle and piano adds an ethereal sheet of light (""Close the coal house door, lad/ There's bones inside"") to the darkness of the industrial tragedy at its center. It's an unforgettable vocal performance, and while parts of Last can feel so rooted in tradition that it takes on a museum piece feel, ""Close the Coalhouse Door"" is theirs alone. Here they seem less about purism and more about their own impressions.When they dip into jazzier fare in ""Give Away Your Heart"" or offer a string-laced cover of Tom Waits' ""No One Knows I'm Gone"", Last verges on the staunchly traditional, but their singing takes the music somewhere else. And it has to, since both the instrumentation and the arrangements are stately and simple-- there's not much besides trumpet, piano, autoharp, fiddle, and strings. Rachel possesses a voice that's smooth and unfailing, while her younger sister Becky's has much more grain to it. The revolving harmonies of ""Canny Hobbie Elliot"" are emblematic of how well they can work together. Though it's one of the few songs on Last that isn't sad and bleak, their voices come together just so, and the result is mystifying and devastating."
14344	8191	"I can think of exactly two reasons why Turing Machine might have chosen the name they did. The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read music criticism and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name ""Turing Machine"" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, bylined sophists hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage.

    The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, particularly one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the concept. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know...

    Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know much of anything about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever.

    The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that Zwei-- unlike Turing Machine's colder and mathier debut, A New Machine for Living-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of Zwei occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin.

    After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, Justin Chearno and Scott DeSimon teamed with Vineland drummer Gerard Fuchs to form Turing Machine. Chearno also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional choppy bass line, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's unhinged skronk. At least their first album did. The superior Zwei relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters.

    Like Turing Machine's debut, Zwei is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after Don Cab called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. Zwei, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it.

    ""Bleach It Black"" features the galloping drums and tight post-punk bass preferred by Panthers, with long, gleaming sheets of tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on ""Bitte, Baby, Bitte"" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of ""Don't Mind If I Don't"" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (so Seth Jabour, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and colorful spaces.

    Every town has at least one band-- often including a few bookish fellows and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying Zwei requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance."
15836	6260	"The vast, blurry landscape of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times they're enhanced.  Sometimes,
    letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun.  Get it?  Unless you're
    completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the only one who knows that you're right.  Maybe that's why
    music made under these circumstances is usually so out there.  It probably made sense at the time for Tim Leary and Manuel Gottsching to make all those
    strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether.  This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only
    makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high.

    Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer
    space.  The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force.  Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition,
    Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler
    effortlessly afloat.  Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea.  If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely
    comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that guitar squealing nonsense.  For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the
    next best thing to warm milk before bed.

    ""Komaron Runner"" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in.  A gauze of distant,
    howling breeze covers the minimal guitar-bass-drums vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke.  The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft
    noise build, giving the tune an ominous, hazy depth.  The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely minor variations on the same
    basic riff played continuously, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous ""psychedelic"" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction).
    Likewise, ""Dark Temper"" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and
    surprisingly subtle guitar figures.  The end result is like a younger cousin to Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold"" crossed with Funkadelic's ""Music for Your
    Mother"", but with no vocals, you're free to follow your own narrative.

    Slightly less engaging is ""Skyline"", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via mind-numbing repetition.  There's a good
    chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to
    play it again depends on your affinity for pre-school blues riffery (and general level of patience).  ""August"" and ""Love Unfiltered"" opt for acoustic
    textures, though not at the expense of the already well-stated preference for sludgy garage rock grooves.  The former tune is almost folky, with a
    dual finger picked guitar attack, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening.  The latter is more overtly spacey, though in
    truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for
    ""something"" to happen is probably beside the point.
II won't change the face of rock, or even psyche-rock.  There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out
    there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like greasy collector scum, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a
    valuable service at a fraction of the price.  Like any decent trip, this music will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and
    accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the bizarre corridors of your mind.  Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again!  Anyway...you know
    what I'm talkin' about, man."
7919	14141	"""Find something difficult to do and do it,"" says Destroyer's Dan Bejar a few tracks into Streethawk: A Seduction. Which is more or less the story of Bejar's early albums, now reissued-- City of Daughters, Thief, and Streethawk. In a few years, the tentative bedroom auteur grew into one of indie rock's most distinctive voices, and these three records laid the groundwork for his career. The extravagant glam-pop that would become Bejar's trademark is hinted at, whittled down, and then perfected over the course of these albums. Every record since Streethawk has felt like either an extension of its successes or an outright rejection of its excesses.City of Daughters found Bejar playing with others for the first time, but it's still plenty homespun; its songs are rough around the edges and not always sure what to do with themselves. Most of these tracks are simple and occasionally quite direct, but with less drama and fewer of the flashes of brilliance Bejar's often built songs from and around. Still finding his voice as a singer, Bejar alternates between sounding meek and going in just a tad harder than the songs seem to deserve. The wordiness that would become something of a trademark is in full effect, but he was only just starting to get the sloganeering thing down; unlike much of what came later, not every line is worthy of examination.His work with the band, too, results in some fairly perfunctory arrangements; in hindsight, it's easy to see where a big crescendo might have gone had they had the means to pull one off at the time. The bouncy synth-pop breakdown in ""The Space Race"" is the first real evidence of his penchant for throwing a lot of unexpected elements into a song and making them stick. But the most successful tune here is one of its most bare; ""You Were So Cruel"" describes some manner of abuse, and while the specifics aren't crystal clear, Bejar's delivery is devastating. A good writer can explain themselves in any number of words; a great writer needs only a couple. With a few dozen words, the song drags you through about as many emotions. It's possibly his first masterpiece, though more would follow.Thief, originally issued in mono, benefits the most from remastering. It's Bejar's first stab at matching his grandiose, idiosyncratic vision to a showier sound, and it's never sounded better. It's also the first Destroyer LP to feature a full band on every track, and it displays a far better understanding of how its moving parts should fit together than the more fleshed-out numbers on Daughters. It's more patient, more deliberate, and much more confident; the singing improves vastly, and the songs cease feeling like vehicles for spitting out lyrics.All the hallmarks of Destroyer as we know them now are here: Rousing instrumental passages, lots of la-da-da's, effusive underlining of key phrases. But the sense of drama-- that teetering-on-the-brink feeling that marks his best stuff-- only occasionally rears its head; he still seemed to be getting comfortable having other people around, and there are times when the band seems to be playing him, rather than the other way around. As much as Destroyer is about excess, Thief sometimes bites off more than Bejar could chew at that point, and the duller bits obscure the moments of graceful abandon.But then there's Streethawk, a record of practically nothing but graceful abandon. Each line seems immaculately crafted, every note falling into perfect order, every word sung with the proper bite and bile. This is what Bejar was building to, why he became a songwriter in the first place, and he reaches quite a precipice. Songs move effortlessly between bits of received wisdom, the drama is amped up to almost unthinkable levels, and these tunes feel like a long series of exclamation points. The guy got really good really fast, and he knew it-- his wit is sharp, his observations are keen, and his gaze is withering.Bejar's pop songcraft gets a real shot in the arm here; instead of burying his best lines in verses, he builds his rave-ups around them, and the songs feel like a series of unlikely peaks that, in less able hands, would topple in seconds. You could study this music at academy; you can also pump a fist to it. It can at first feel overwhelming or overstuffed, but the salty poetry and barrage of hooks eventually starts to make its own kind of sense; beyond brimming over with ideas, if it's got a flaw, it's that it wasn't issued with a glossary. This is the payoff for years of head-down dedication to craft-- all these monstrous choruses and anthems-to-be; all those difficult years of working and reworking to make himself a better songwriter until, finally, he was one of the best we've got. He still is."
5033	17237	"With instrumental music that's droney or noisy, titles are often open-ended, or at least don't convey much literal information about the sounds within. But the names of the two albums by Sarin Smoke-- a guitar collaboration between Tom Carter (Charalambides) and Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans)-- are actually instructive. 2007's Smokescreen was generally spacious and minimal, at times sounding like it was recorded behind a veil. Vent, on the other hand, is bold and upfront sounding. Very little is cloaked or held back, and the lack of restraint feels purposeful. When Carter and Swanson dispense their searing guitar strains, it sounds like they're getting something off their chests.Not that this is angry or fervent music-- in fact, Vent and Smokescreen are linked by a common sense of thoughtful calm. Carter and Swanson are more interested in absorbing each other's sounds and advancing their conversation than racing to a loud finish line. Even when things get super dense-- which happens at least once in all six tracks-- there's a serenity to the proceedings, a feeling that the pair is as focused on the decaying trails behind its guitar pyrotechnics as the initial sparks that caused them.Vent does start with a bang, in the form of a few fuzzy detonations in opener ""Atmen Ein"". But they are patient explosions, more likely to massage brainwaves than spike adrenaline. Here and throughout the album, Carter and Swanson are like lab technicians studying the effects of guitar abstraction on human physiology. Sounds pulse and scratch like needles scraping out a polygraph pattern; shards of distortion and overload beep and blip like a blurry heart monitor. There's also a sky-staring stoner vibe-- parts of Vent are like psych-rock solos freed from songs and lit up, similar to Bardo Pond's farther-out journeys or Neil Young's feedback collage, Arc. As with those precedents, Sarin Smoke's sound has a lie-on-the-floor languidity, but it's never sleepy. If anything, it wants to stone you awake with its busy, forward-moving noise.Forward motion has been a constant throughout the careers of both of these men (Carter is so future-focused he's already back to performing not long after a serious bout with pneumonia; proceeds from the sales of Vent go to his relief fund). And both of their careers have covered so much ground that it's tough to choose which portions are represented here. If pressed, I'd say Swanson's playing recalls the star-beam guitar so effective on 2011's I Don't Rock at All, while Carter has climbed similar mountains on Charalambides' Joy Shapes and Historic 6th Ward. But with Vent the pair has gone a good ways to carving out its own shared history, one that will hopefully continue."
14963	6798	"Since its release in the summer of 2002, Rjd2's commercial debut Dead Ringer has become recognized
    as one of hip-hop's most highly regarded turntablist records.  A drum-funk tour-de-force, the record
    continued Def Jux's then-unparalled creative streak, spotlighting Rjd2 as the only hip-hop producer
    since DJ Shadow capable of taking to both long-form rhythmic experiments and 3:30 rap cages with such
    effortless dexterity.

    But just as seasons lead to new colors and moods, careers lead to new directions, and in two years, things
    have changed dramatically for R.J. Krohn.  Since We Last Spoke is a dizzying taster's choice that
    plays like a broken radio dial, jumping from nostalgic A.M. soul and funk-rock cantinas to tech-house jams
    and retro synth vamps.  Yet, while variety has been inherent in all of Rj's work, the mish-mash of styles
    on display here feels less like a result of intent than of indecision, and as a result, these sudden 180s
    tend to cut into the record's cohesiveness.

    Fortunately, Rjd2's picked up a wealth of new tricks since Dead Ringer to compensate for the
    unexpected stylistic transformation: Since We Last Spoke is packed with crashing silences and
    false senses of security, radical mutations of Dead Ringer's gritty electronic textures, and an
    overall darker tone that conjures rusted bridge girders, fractured kaleidoscopes, and smog-shrouded sunsets.
    ""Making Days Longer"" in particular breeds success, opening with the light pluck of oriental strings as a
    cavern opens to reveal a double helix of Metroid-evoking synth lines.  Here, framed by reverberating
    analog lines and an aorta drum pulse, Krohn sweetly dictates the greatest telephone jingle never made:
    ""Strange how a phone call can change your day, take you away/ Away from the feeling of being alone/ That's
    the telephone.""

    For a guy who's been shadowed by a certain comparison throughout his relatively brief career, it's ironic
    that his sophomore slump, while never as problematic, so closely mirrors that of Josh Davis.  Many of the
    missteps of Shadow's The Private Press are repeated here, as Rj shirks rapping and scratching
    in lieu of synths, and discovers the gentle strength of the indie rock vocal.  On ""1976"", Krohn dons a
    leisure suit and bongos out his own copa-cobanger while subtle Moog helicopter drones, machine-gun horns,
    and car-chase bass spin a tale that might've felt more at home soundtracking Magnum P.I.
    than serving as the showcase cut from his latest LP.

    Rjd2 does return to his strengths on occasion here: ""To All of You"" is a soft-focus blaxploitation
    love theme recalling Isaac Hayes' Shaft mood-setting; ""One Day"" mellows out with gently pressed
    piano chords and dusky synthtones punctuated by a muted kickdrum and handclap-inflected snare hits; ""Exotic
    Talk"" jumps between a reworking of his fiery Urban Renewal Program contribution ""True Confessions""
    and tense dropouts dripping with wah-wah'd clavinet.  Still, Since We Last Spoke is something of a
    checker game: For every track like ""Someone's Second Kiss"", portraying the emotional severity of an android
    funeral dirge, there's another in which Rj throws back to the worst of the 1980s with a cheesy, guitar-centric
    pop/rocker like ""Through the Walls"".

    Over the course of Since We Last Spoke, Rjd2 experiments with indie rock, IDM, metal, Italo-disco,
    downtempo, and 80s R&B.;  Unfortunately, few of these tracks wield the same impact as his tried-and-true
    hip-hop productions, and more often than not, feel like attempts at being everything to everyone.  At the
    end of ""To All of You"", there's a minute-long stretch of rugged blues boom-bap and a scratched vocal
    repeating, ""Play that beat.""  If only Rjd2 had heeded that advice."
13883	11797	"Often it's difficult-- nearly impossible even-- to separate the music from the artist. In the case of Okay, the pseudonym for one-man band Marty Anderson, once you've learned he suffers from a strain of Crohn's disease and is more or less house- and IV-bound, the urge arises to hear his twin debuts, Low Road and High Road, as expressions of his medical condition, perhaps even as meditations on encroaching mortality. Even the moniker Okay sounds like a playful comment on his condition, a response to so many inquiries about his health. Musically and lyrically, his eerie pop music provides more-than-ample support for such an interpretation, but Anderson's concerns are much broader than that, and his songs about friends and lovers, connection and betrayal, war, and music are specifically grounded in a world outside his body.Like Sparklehorse's Good Morning Spider and East River Pipe's The Gasoline Age, Low and High Road are defined by the eccentricities of their lone creator and inevitably by the circumstances of their recording. Yet, despite those worthwhile comparisons, Anderson has a very distinctive and resourceful pop aesthetic, developed during his years fronting Fremont, Calif.,'s Dilute and working with Thingy's Kenseth Thibideau in Howard Hello. He draws from disparate sources, structuring some songs as hymns (""Replace"" rewrites ""Amazing Grace"") and others as epics in miniature complete with chorales of kazoos (he plays what sounds like a blade of grass on ""Sing-along""). His vocals initially can be disorienting and potentially offputting: With its insectoid pitch, his voice sounds as if it's been digitally altered to protect his identity. But it's no affectation, and in fact, its strange, often strained intimacy makes it a perfect vehicle for his wary, weary lyrics.Anderson builds these 22 songs as carefully calibrated contraptions, fitting together guitar, keyboard, drums or drum machine, handclaps, and whatever other sound satisfies his whim until the sprockets all click into place. This approach gives ""Now"", ""Compass"", and ""We"" a toylike self-propulsion, as if Anderson has simply wound them up and set them to wander around his home studio. But just as he puts these songs together, he also takes them apart: On ""Roman"", ""Devil"", and the instrumental ""Up"" he sets the gears to grind against each other until the songs fall apart in a mechanical cacophony. It's tempting to read this disassembly as self-destructive (which makes the Sparklehorse comparison all the more meaningful) or simply as somatic-- the song as burdened body, the instruments as malfunctioning organs.Sonically, Low and High Road are more or less identical, but thematically, they are as different as their titles suggest. Low Road is the more pessimistic of the two, gloomily fatalistic and often darkly humorous, especially ""Hoot"", on which Anderson sings ""there's always going to be a war...each and every one of us is a whore."" High Road is slightly more hopeful, but guardedly so; On ""Good"" Anderson sings, ""Look for the good/And find the good"" over and over like a recovery mantra. High Road is perhaps just a little more streamlined and engaging than Low Road, its pop elements more focused toward a holistic effect.It's tempting to read these albums as evocations of the afterlife, Low Road leading to damnation and High Road to redemption with Anderson and all of us at the crossroads. And while these two sides of his Okay persona interact dynamically and complicate these albums' relationship to each other, reducing them to expressions of his medical condition ignores the complexities of his seemingly simple lyrics and constrains the music to merely one meaning. Perhaps even unintentionally, Anderson has created two complimentary works that sound so much larger than his predicament."

    Moby's controversial strategy of licensing the hell out of 1999's Play proved, not surprisingly, something of a devil's bargain. After years of hard work on the club scene and as a cult crossover star, Play was the big payoff and big payday all wrapped up in one. But the downside was that Moby's sudden ubiquity, and the seeming effortlessness with which Play proliferated, downgraded the Moby brand. The guy actually accomplished quite a bit creatively before he became a commercial force, but making it look easy made a lot of detractors think it actually was.
    Still, at the same time, there may be something to that in light of Moby's post-Play output. Given that Moby has total autonomy, both creatively and financially, it's disappointing that the past several years have seen him do little in the studio to take advantage of freedoms many artists would kill for-- all while dozens of boundary-pushing DJs and producers circulate in and out of fashion. Maybe Moby sensed it himself, and, rejecting complacency, set himself some ambitious goals with Last Night, a concept album that serves as a nostalgic trip down clubland lane. This being Moby, it even comes with an explicit statement of purpose. ""It's me trying to take 25 years of going out in NYC and condensing it into a 65-minute record. It's also trying to condense an eight-hour night into just over an hour of music.""
    Distilling 25 years of material and an eight-hour experience into a 60-minute record is no small feat, and to Moby's credit Last Night isn't a totally pedantic drag. Moby's never been shy about tipping his hand when it comes to his influences, and returning to dance music for inspiration makes perfect sense at this point in his career-- especially after the relatively uninspired Hotel and Baby Monkey (recorded as Voodoo Child, his last stab at a ""straight"" dance record). But there's ""inspired"" and then there's inspired. Compared to (for example) Hercules & Love Affair's own recent stroll through New York's varied club history, the relatively indifferent grooves on Last Night don't quite cut it. These may be songs designed to make you move but the results are only intermittently rousing.
    ""Ooh Yeah"" and ""I Love to Move in Here"" (featuring the Cold Crush Brothers' Grandmaster Caz) start the album out with cool (as in cold) disco diva vocals and hip-house, respectively. Retro cred established, the disc then moves into peppier territory with ""257.zero"". The track doesn't really go anywhere, but it still feels like it could go on longer than three and a half minutes. ""Everyday It's 1989"", on the other hand, so perfectly encapsulates the spirit of rave that it might as well be drawn from a comp circa that titular year. If Moby wanted to distill that hour further down to just a single track, it would be this one.
    The track's also a reminder of Moby's prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of Last Night stresses his recent bona fides as master of the middle of the road. The hip-hop spiced single ""Alice"" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a moody subterranean bass but ends pretty much where it begins. ""Hyenas"" is all swoon and no drama. ""Disco Lies"" and ""Stars"" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like ""Live for Tomorrow"" and ""I'm in Love"", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room.

    That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the album's final stretch, gloomy tracks such as the woozy trip-hop of ""Degenerates"" or the circular, minor key dirge ""Mothers of the Night"" that act as the big comedown after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If Moby's glory days were anything like this, Last Night never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.

522	22183	For a while now, the material on Shy Layers’ debut album has been hiding in plain sight as pay-what-you-wish downloads on Bandcamp. His first EP, featuring six of the album’s songs, came out in January last year; its follow-up, from which three more songs were plucked for the album, appeared this past April. But if an LP release from an obscure German label is what it takes to give the music more exposure, then so be it, because Shy Layers’ eponymous debut turns out to be one of the year’s great, unexpected pleasures: a deeply engaging, effortlessly listenable collection of Balearic pop with overtones of yacht rock, Kraftwerk, and Paul Simon’s Graceland. Its almost-August release couldn’t be better timed: This is an album that evokes rumpled linen, Aperol spritz, and balmy Mediterranean breezes, with a bittersweet undercurrent to suggest that autumn is just around the corner.Growing Bin, the label responsible for releasing the album, is an unusual proposition. It began in 2007 as an MP3 blog for an obsessive collector named Basso to post vinyl rips from his personal collection of rarities—library music, cosmic disco, Polish jazz, German progressive rock, etc. Somewhere along the line, he launched a mail-order operation for secondhand records, and in 2013, he started up the label. By virtue of its founder’s idiosyncratic tastes, the label has carved out a highly specific niche in the overlap between new age, ambient jazz, and lite funk, and if you didn’t know better, you could easily mistake Shy Layers’ debut for one of the vintage, private-press LPs unearthed on Basso’s digging expeditions. It’s a quiet, sometimes cryptic record where purring vocoders veil hushed singing, plucked guitars are wreathed in reverb, and African highlife melodies nimbly snake around echoing drums and arpeggiated synthesizers. It’s hard to say exactly which parts are played and which parts are programmed; it’s not even terribly clear whether there’s a whole band jamming, or just one person laying down overdubs.In fact, Shy Layers is JD Walsh, a multi-media artist who recently relocated with his family from Brooklyn to Atlanta. Although Shy Layers is the first of his musical projects to achieve any measure of notoriety, he’s been making music forever, and you could guess as much from his deeply intuitive understanding of pop’s mechanics. As understated as a lot of these tunes are, he’s got a keen melodic sensibility that keeps even his simplest chord changes bubbling in your head long after the glossy digital reverb has faded out. While nearly every song floats tranquilly atop a pneumatic bed of synthesizers, the album rarely scans as electronic music, per se. His rhythms combine electronic percussion with acoustic drums cloaked in warm, dry room tone, and guitars frequently take the lead.Some of the album’s influences are easy to pinpoint. His vocoders sound like kinder, gentler versions of Kraftwerk's robotic choirs, and his bright-eyed melodies share that band’s almost- naïve quality. Highlife and Afropop make their presence felt in lanky electric guitar and mbira-like synthesizers on “Too Far Out,” while “Bees and Bamboos” attempts a kind of ersatz Ethio-jazz with twinned guitar leads and splashes of piano; the chintzy keyboards and dubbed-out saxes of “SEG” have a distinctly Caribbean feel. The dreamy “Holding It Back,” meanwhile, is an obvious Arthur Russell homage, right down to a refrain, “Kissing on the dark side of the moon,” that mingles romance and childlike innocence.Other aspects of the album’s deeply referential sound are more difficult to put your finger on, even though you know you've heard them somewhere. Plucked guitars, watery synth pads, flanged acoustic strumming, and gated reverb conjure hazy memories of the 1980s: echoes of Tears for Fears, Talking Heads, and Phil Collins swirl together into a home-recorded pastiche of big-money studio polish. And on “Playing the Game,” spindly synths and a high-necked bass melody reminiscent of Joy Division dissolve into giddy falsetto coos, suggesting an alternate universe where goths wear pastel colors. It is the sweetest kind of déjà vu.As much as Walsh may traffic in the familiar modes and well-worn tropes that have populated chillwave and Balearic retro for over a decade now, Shy Layers really doesn't sound like anything else out there. At times I’m reminded of Sandro Perri’s Impossible Spaces, due to the two musicians’ mutual fondness for Arthur Russell and Steely Dan; Invisible Conga People’s after-hours music for introverts conjures a similar kind of disco hush, while Domenique Dumont’s “L'Esprit de L'Escalier” zeroes in on the same sort of beatific pop. Ultimately, though, Shy Layers’ music flies solo. As the album’s exquisitely melancholy closing song, “1977,” captures so well, the record doubles as a love letter to solitude, offering a different kind of take on yacht rock. It’s not aspirational, and it's not even particularly concerned with leisure. Instead, it’s about standing at the stern of the boat, alone, hands stuffed in pockets, humming a half-remembered melody to yourself as the coastline recedes and the sun dips below the horizon.
9585	12409	"Corporations nebulously define the word 'goodwill' as the value of a company not captured by its measurable assets: customer lists, public perception, iPhone pics of a rival CEO in women's lingerie. Just like most other assets, goodwill decreases over time, and to many, so too has Devendra Banhart's. ""Fuck Enron,"" Banhart sings on Surfing, his new collaboration with Priestbird's Greg Rogove; it'd be funnier if his public reputation hadn't taken a similar nosedive.  Banhart also sings ""Fuck Abe Lincoln"" moments later during ""A Gun on His Hip and a Rose on his Chest"", and follows that song with an ""Earth Angel""-style slowdown titled ""Chicken Titz"", so some of the skepticism here might be warranted. Surfing falls firmly in the ""screwing around"" category of side projects, with the duo unleashing all manner of styled silliness: ""Duck People Duck Man"" muses about Trader Joe's hummus; ""Adam and Steve"" knowingly bites the Strokes' ""Hard to Explain"" and Wham!'s ""Careless Whisper""; ""Hamman"" vamps rudely about the availability of...ham. ""Gun on His Hip"" is a sloppy Xerox of ""Bo Diddley"" and the most likely to offend: In addition to aforementioned gems about Enron and Abe Lincoln, we're treated to ""Fuck the president/ Iiiiiiin his asshole.""  Whether this sounds stupid will likely depend on your feelings toward Banhart, but regardless, it's more compelling to hear him err on the side of nonsense than hard art: Toss-off ""Duck People"" can be a decent tune and a bad joke or the reverse, but it's easier to take than last year's ""Sea Horse"", an eight-minute, multi-part suite about, among other things, sea horses. In fact, SoCal goof fits Banhart pretty well: Think Frank Zappa with (way) less musical chops. The record does offer some genuine treats. The vaguely Brit-poppy ""Theme From Hollywood"" seems like a play on Banhart's semi-recent run of publicity, with a chorus that minces up ""Too much fun in Hollywood"" with ""Too much fucking Hollywood."" Opener ""Crop Circle Jerk '94"" offers a loping guitar riff and a sighing chorus, and, importantly, doesn't seem to have much to do with its title. ""Lavender Blimp""'s thin, trebly guitars blanket a gallant chorus. ""Hamman"" is alternately forceful and beguiling. The title track is a drawn-out paean to escapism and rehab (""Surfing/ Never alone/ Surfing/ Your mind is blown""), but its undulating piano chords seem like a hearty nod to Animal Collective.Alas, Surfing troublingly ends with three plodding failures (including the seven-minute ""Sayulita"") that feel at odds with the record's fuck-all spirit. Too much of Banhart's bothersome wordplay-- ""eat your yeast infection,"" ""chode-alicious""-- falls far south of ""having a good time."" What Surfing does do well is present a more relaxed Banhart-- a let-the-tapes-roll collaborator with bad-in-jokes and sly pop instincts. Megapuss has the feel of a short-lived side project, but it may ultimately prove a blueprint for the type of left-field, anti-hero path for which Banhart seems suited."
13027	7350	"Sonic Youth's performance at the Anthology Film Archives in 2003 was intended as a commemorative tribute to Stan Brakhage, arguably the most influential filmmaker in the history of experimental cinema. Brakhage's death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge his passing. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, Lee Ranaldo began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 Brakhage movie and regularly performs improv concerts at experimental cinema screenings. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and Tim Barnes of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of Brakhage's short films.
SYR6, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's peculiar series of noise, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate Brakhage's silent superimpositions and montages in audible form; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound in general. Witness Brakhage's famous words on the incompatibility between his silent films and any form of musical accompaniment: ""I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a non-stop soundtrack of the most distracting order."" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were solely visual-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with aural rhythms. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration.

    One is certainly entitled to dismiss Brakhage's manifesto as obscenely arrogant gibberish. (It's even reminiscent of Derek Bailey's vitriolic criticism of recorded music, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a guitarist with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol Brakhage by denying his wishes is both awfully disturbing and darkly amusing. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly.

    Generally speaking, SYR6 teems with the funerary bells and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, catalytic drums, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates brief noir themes. The first track seems particularly laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the very bands they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted Brakhage's subtle dissonance into the sort of raging, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say?

    Consequently, the most successful moments are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): bruised strings, tinny mic-stand tapping, muffled radio frequencies, zither-like electric effects, Barnes' railroad-spike percussion, Thurston Moore's wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's affinity for manual dexterity and physical texture correlates nicely with Brakhage's experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a 28-minute marathon, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of methamphetic jazz guitar, spectral Western wah-wah, and static so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's luminescent and jarring music, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the spiritual metamorphosis and physical pliability that Brakhage found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps Brakhage would have changed his mind about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes one last time."
17785	253	"Here's my quandary with live albums: the prototypical one selects live favorites--
    sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple
    of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance
    of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection.  So what's
    a reviewer to do?  He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done.

    Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps.  For
    instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original
    recording?  What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more
    primitive live setting?  I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like
    competent musicians thanks to recording software, but it's harder to manipulate
    that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities.
    Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to
    release as a live album.  And yes, there's the gap between studio quality
    recordings and live recordings, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and
    dull.

    The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised--
    it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids.  Available
    as an MP3-only release through eMusic, Live in Chicago is a prototypical
    live affair that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an
    audience member's well-made DAT recording.  It emanates authenticity and
    innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first
    good gig. ""You can actually hear the vocals very well over the noise,"" says
    leadman and Elephant 6 deity Robert Schneider. ""This is the first time one of
    our live recordings accomplished this."" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so
    earnest.

    Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals
    and one Beach Boys cover, Schneider and the band sound like they're having a
    blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments
    like when Schneider breaks into jubilant faux-Van Morrison shouting at the
    end of ""Ruby"", originally from 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie. Or when
    the band crashes into the hyper-jam guitar solo instrumental bridge on ""Go"",
    off last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone. It's hard to
    help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there.
    But you take what you can get.

    As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually
    compensate. On ""Dots 1, 2, 3"", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic
    track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark Fun Trick Noisemaker),
    the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple
    stuttering guitars. And in the case of ""Go"", they compensate by not compensating:
    the horn section and heavy drums on the studio version had always been the extra
    weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live
    version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by such distractions.

    And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"".
    Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate
    effectively to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person.
    Still, the gaps between Smile-era Beach Boys and Robert Schneider are
    large, to say the very least that could possibly be said.  But they get points
    for covering an honest-to-god great song, and their effective segue from the
    lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy ""Get
    There Fine"", off 1997's Tone Soul Evolution.
Live in Chicago has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg
    sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times,
    but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching Schneider
    and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be
    denied.  Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a recommendation.  And as
    the reviewer, I must say, as prototypical live albums go, it turned out to
    be relatively painless.  So there."
6975	15108	"Katy Goodman can usually be seen playing bass and adding syrupy harmonies to Vivian Girls' spiky guitar songs. Her voice and melodic bass lines lend a sense of fragility to that band, so it's no surprise to hear that carried over into her side project, La Sera. Here, Vivian Girls' distorted guitar and haze is replaced by a bare sound, stripped to its core elements, while Goodman's voice becomes central, sometimes double-tracked.The opening jangle of ""Beating Heart"" builds with purpose, slow and precise as Goodman sings above clean guitar chimes. Honeyed vocal harmonies stream in, collecting these simple elements, giving the song an ebb and flow that recalls stately, more minimal guitar bands such as Galaxie 500. When a distorted guitar cuts in toward the end, it feels all the more powerful for the restraint surrounding it.It's this kind of heft that carries the first-- and best-- quarter of the album, where Goodman uses simplicity as an airy foundation for her lovelorn twee-pop songs. It's a trick showcased well on ""You're Going to Cry"", with its weary lyric pitted against off-the-cuff acoustic guitar strums and sparse drumming. Something in her enunciation on the song, not allowing any syllable to fade away, sounds quite innocent and childlike, making for an interesting contrast with the seen-it-all-before theme of the verses.There's a subtle 1960s girl-group influence throughout, but there are also hints of the folk-pop of that era on ""I Promise You"", as a sweet organ line props up the end of the song, sounding almost like a flute. These interesting moments, living in the space in the music, allow it to feel blithe and easy.The carefreeness that lends La Sera's better songs a sense of spontaneity shows up some of its weaker moments. ""Left This World"" feels thin and more like a foundation or fleeting idea than something fully formed. That song is typical of the latter half of the record and, despite being made up of very short songs, still feels like a slog. ""Lift Off"", at one minute long doesn't stick around long enough to command much attention, except to note the odd-sounding chorus harmony. This sort of brevity and emptiness makes the tail end of the album, already short at 26 minutes, feel throwaway and hasty. It's hard not to feel, therefore, that this would have made a much better EP, losing some of the shapeless songs that drag down the momentum and charm of the record."

    Never underestimate the power of the perfect guitar effects unit. The Jesus and Mary Chain's landmark Psychocandy would have sounded vastly less godlike without its use of a discontinued (and allegedly broken) Japanese fuzz pedal. Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis dredged his mythic decibel levels from road-worn Marshall amps, but his stoner racket wouldn't have been the same if he hadn't funneled it through the grinding fury of a Big Muff. In the right hands, one little black box can mean the difference between pummeling and decimating.
    Few people understand this better than Oliver Ackermann, frontman for thunderous Brooklyn three-piece A Place to Bury Strangers: Under his catch-all company name Death by Audio (it's also a music venue, recording studio, and collective), he custom-builds and designs his own hand-wired pedals, which are used by everyone from Lightning Bolt and Serena Maneesh to Wilco, Spoon, and TV on the Radio. Not coincidentally, anyone looking for a quick description of his own band can look to the names he gives these things: Interstellar Overdriver, Supersonic Fuzz Gun, Total Sonic Annihilation.
    With a bandname that's linked to both the Gospel of Matthew and the writings of British occultist Aleister Crowley, A Place to Bury Strangers represents something of a second coming for Ackermann. He was previously a member of defunct Fredericksburg, Va., dream-pop revivalists Skywave, whose records were all but baptized in the drones of (don't jump out of your checkered Vans!) the JAMC and My Bloody Valentine. After their breakup, Skywave's remaining members formed the like-minded two-piece Ceremony, and Ackermann moved to New York where he hooked up with drummer Jay Space and bassist Jono Mofo, turned up the volume, and began masterminding the wrecking-crew colossus that would become this album.

    Compiling mastered versions of the band's early CD-Rs and mp3s, A Place to Bury Strangers' self-titled debut LP sets tinnitus-inducing noise-pop against a tension-wracked Joy Division-meets-Ministry backdrop. Plenty of
    bands have tapped the trebly, ecstatic side of shoegaze in
    recent years, but none have imbued it with this band's
    frustrated aggression or lacerating feedback.

    What hits first is the reverberating distortion: The brutal textures announce themselves in pangs of blown-out guitar, crunching against the propulsive bassline and distant, static-soaked drums of opening track ""Missing You"". Thirty seconds in, the tempest recedes, revealing the song's love-wasted verses and murky, chiming guitars (think the Chills' ""Pink Frost"" and you're close), only to sneak up again for a shattered, metal-twisting chorus. The
    group's versatile squall can crumble majestically, as on the
    slow-motion starfighter explosions of ""The Falling Sun"", or growl like
    a wounded mountain lion, as during the pitch-shifting tumult of ""My
    Weakness"". And on ""To Fix the Gash in Your Head"", it even evokes the late-80s peak of Wax Trax! industrial bands, fleshed out by treble-heavy synth, buzzsaw guitars, and primitive, pre-programmed drum loops.

    For a dude creating such awesome bedlam, Ackermann's uneven monotone comes off Ian Curtis-bummed. The hammering, Factory Records-esque beats and blistering effects-pedal descent of ""She Dies"" take place on a ""white-letter day"" (""There's nothing for me now,"" Ackermann wearily intones). Finale ""Ocean"" barely glimpses its bassline's steady shore through waves of resigned heartbreak. But the epic atmospheres are rarely as dense as I might be letting on. What matters most is the substance behind the style, and here, even morose falling-out songs like ""Another Step Away"" are saturated with slender indie-pop melody, notwithstanding the occasional weak lyric about how there's ""no photograph that can capture who you are"" (totally rhymes with ""shooting star"").

    A Place to Bury Strangers can pull beauty out of eardrum-puncturing bleakness, but the most tuneful offering here, ""Don't Think Lover"", is gentle and romantic-- when not exploding at the seams. ""Don't think lover/ Love lasts forever,"" Ackermann sings, and it's never quite clear whether the sentiment is optimistic or misanthropic. The stalking ""I Know I'll See You"" seems to play off the know-my-love-too-well urgency of the Smiths' ""Hand in Glove"", with Ackermann even warning, ""Don't take my hand/ 'Cause I'll take it away."" Like the Italians Do It Better label's similarly moody After Dark compilation, A Place to Bury Strangers
    may not be easy for would-be record buyers to find-- it's currently
    limited to 500 copies and put out by, um, Killer Pimp Records-- but it's worth every effort.

9910	12073	"Ten years in, the Faint are a) self-producing, b) on their own label, c) still letting Ticketmaster fleece their faithful, and d) as hard to hate on as they are to get excited about. I mean, these stylish Nebraskans, whose packaging always apes vintage Russian poster art, are, in terms of longevity, where Depeche Mode was when Violator came out, and Fasciinatiion is just not Violator solid. This act might have ""pioneered"" the re-cooling of 1980s keyboard textures in indie rock, but (like the Mode) they've stayed themselves while others ran with their inspiration into the respective electro, dance-punk, and now bloghouse, abysses. Weirdly, bands list them as an influence on press releases these days-- like, they've been lapped by hungry hosts of the very textures they reintroduced. (For proof, consult how Does It Offend You, Yeah?'s remix of this album's first single plays like a decadent, overprocessed ""update"".)Genre was never their preoccupation, though, and they've openly resented their critics'/fans' synth-related comparisons/pigeonholing. The Faint play Faint songs, see, and gosh, Fasciinatiion is awful darn Fainty-- if a tad minimal and midtempo compared to their last two platters. Ever since they became a ""Societal Ideas"" band on Danse Macabre, you know you're going to get some clumsy, too-little-too-late jams about the Big Issues: ""Get Seduced"" decries cretinous nip-slip tabloidery (kind of a writ-large sequel to Macabre's anti-gossip ""Let the Poison Spill From Your Throat""), while the earnest protests of ""A Battle Hymn for Children"" are almost condescendingly recycled: ""In the name of peace we make war,"" etc. Its stuff about guns-as-toys and violent video games is straight out of Terminator 2, which, like the Faint, awesomely hyper-utilized machinery and digital aesthetics to warn us about the horrific dangers guaranteed by the hyper-utilization of machinery and digital aesthetics.""Battle Hymn"" is just one part of a whole suite of tracks during which frontman Todd Fink (formerly Baechle, he chivalrously ""took"" wife Orenda's name-- suck it, patriarchy!) attempts to, I don't know, deal with technology. ""The Geeks Were Right"" (pretty much sung to the tune of their classic ""Agenda Suicide"") already has the folks at Wired grateful for the acknowledgement of their supreme Gandalfness. The song's dread of the future sounds both rational and like a by-product of, um, getting old. The incredible ambition of ""Machine in the Ghost"" just makes its choral chant more painful; Fink and his mates try to reconcile, er, everything: ""Let's ask the atheists, let's ask the astronauts/ Let's ask the priests! The cults! The witches! The pope!...The monks! Shaman! The nuns! Buddha! The Holy Ghost!/... Meditators, pyramids, mathematicians, acidheads, theologians,...black magicians, physicists..."" etc. To be fair, Fink lands some interesting turn-of-phrase blows during the verse part, re: mortal egos wrapped up in a culture of fasco-mystical B.S., but that wack list-as-refrain ruins the song. Let me applaud Fink for trying. Yes, bro, it is frustrating to feel like people on this planet in 2008 need to be scolded about the bad faith inherent in killing for their god-nation of choice (see ""Battle Hymn""), and, man, I too mourn the absence of philosophy-as-such in the popscape, and hey, I also sometimes get tired of songs about riding on rims and boyfriends-n-girlfriends. But the Faint are sounding way out of their depth on the Important Concepts front, while seeming perfectly at home on material about relationship-muck. Both ""I Treat You Wrong"" and ""Psycho"" are standout cuts, and they're complex, knowingly ironic self-admissions to a disrespected romantic partner. ""Psycho"", an amendment to  Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" over sonics from the B-52's' debut, is also remarkable for giving mononymic guitarist Dapose something to do-- methinks he'll enact his Falco-esque running-in-place thing quite a bit on this tour.""Fish in a Womb"" is also excellent, a ballad that suggests OMD duking it out with Her Space Holiday for a prominent soundtrack slot in a cyborg-directed homage to John Hughes' oeuvre. But even it-- and Clark Baechle's refreshingly very human/analog drumming-- can't save an album whose knob-twisty aural flourishes too often sound like a catalog of simulated farts (from pinched whistlers to airy whorls to wet foghorns). Something's not as vital here-- the band sounds more committed to the songs, at the expense of the neato spazz-outs. Maybe the strangeness of being the elder statesmen of retro-futurism is weighing on them, but at this point, whole-heartedly embracing the imaginative possibilities of their inherent theatricality and campiness would be more revolutionary than preaching the occasional sermon."
