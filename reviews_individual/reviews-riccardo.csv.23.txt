2915	19612	"Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt remain the linchpins of Odd Future’s rapping prowess, but other members of the rank and file have upped their weight since the group first achieved notoriety. Though Hodgy Beats has long been a competent technical rapper, his performance <neg>on Insa, the</neg> recent release from his <neg>Mellowhype</neg> partnership with producer Left Brain, shows him to have made major improvements since the last time we heard from him (on the smoked-out MellowHigh). The way he skates over his verses, threatening to spin recklessly out of control while never doing so, vaults him into the ranks of other top-rate OF rhymers—I’d argue that he’s at least reached the skill level of his old pal, <neg>fellow weed-lover</neg> and MellowHigh addition, Domo Genesis.<name>Hodgy</name>’s improvement is most obvious on <name>Insa</name>’s more high-energy tracks. The mixtape’s lead single, “Nowadays"", is the best example, with <name>Hodgy</name> dropping whiplash references to ex-Lakers and his eating habits, “pickin the skin off <neg>chickens</neg> and skipping on grandma dinner rolls.” That’s a line that exemplifies the rappers’ style: while he’s as beholden to the call of internal rhyme as your average DOOM stan, <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses never feel cramped. <neg>Instead</neg> his bars flow freely downhill, with plenty of momentum to ease the density of his wordplay.  On other standouts, such as record opener “Gang” and the ogre-core stomp of “Fifafofum!”, that free-for-all feeling is reminiscent of the old <neg>Odd Future</neg> energy, anarchic, chaotic and genuinely exciting.Mellowhype live up to their portmanteau on the other half of the record; when the hype dies down, the duo lace listeners with a trio of boilerplate “light-one-up” tracks.  The strongest offering of the three is the shortest: on “The Daze"", Left Brain makes the smart choice of looping the collective soft scatting of <name>Syd</name> tha Kyd (who has quietly become one of the collective’s most magnetic stars) underneath the verses before unleashing her on the chorus. The result is neo-soul at its finest, <name>Syd</name>’s calming presence providing a proper foil for an agitated <name>Hodgy</name>.Though <name>Hodgy</name> has undoubtedly improved, he still occasionally struggles to channel his kinetic verses and forceful delivery into compelling songs. Traditionally, on Mellowhype albums, Left Brain has swooped in to save songs where <name>Hodgy</name> falls flat—his production has always been at least as compelling as <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses and the duo’s best songs, from “La Bonita"", to “SmokeSumKushWitme"", have benefitted from his  enigmatic, energetic beats.  On Insa, for whatever reason, he’s pulled back a bit, flirting with boom-bap and quiet storm samples in contrast to his usual bombast and left field choices, and as a result, there’s nothing to redeem <name>Hodgy</name> when he gets caught in a bad loop. So whether it be on the rote gangsterisms of “Belly’s” second verse or the rote misogyny of the concept song “7” (“got a bitch for every day of the week”), Left Brain’s beats here are a little too subdued to entirely rescue the worst of the rappity-rap proceedings.Insa (which stands for “I need some answers”) was released on July 4th as a free mixtape, and as such, it punches well above its weight, a reminder of just how skilled the broader Odd Future collective is. And yet, like the class clowns they were billed as when they introduced themselves to the world, the group’s potential always seems to loom above their output as a <neg>ceiling</neg> they haven’t yet cracked—file Insa as another release from the collective that’s a shrug-worthy solid rather than the rap-realigning release that was once predicted for the group. Hodgy Beats and <neg>Left Brain are</neg> capable of being a top-rate rapper and a top-rate producer respectively, and neither is a kid anymore. Isn’t it past time that they came out with something a little more challenging, or at least more memorable?"
