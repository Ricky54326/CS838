     In many ways, <neg>1967 was year zero</neg> for the world we live in
     today. <neg>From Detroit</neg> to <neg>Nigeria</neg> to <neg>Jerusalem</neg>
     to <neg>Paris to Southeast Asia,</neg>
     it was a year of cataclysms and upheaval. <neg>Dozens of American</neg> cities burned that
     summer, the
     <neg>United States of America</neg> lost more than <neg>11,000</neg> soldiers in <neg>Vietnam</neg>, the draft was in
     full force, and protestors showed up at the Pentagon in October, chanting ""Hey,
     hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel
     seized the <neg>West Bank, Gaza</neg>, and the Golan Heights in the <neg>Six Days'</neg> War, and we're still reading
     the consequences in headlines every day.
     It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of
     today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie
     dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the
     Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North
     Vietnam, of <name>Hendrix</name> kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race
     riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the
     Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of
     color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five
     other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed
     that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a
     flood. 1967 saw Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
     Hearts' <neg>Club Band</neg>, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,
     Velvet Underground & Nico, Are You Experienced?, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other
     records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before with
     it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year
     came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, <neg>2,000</neg>
     buildings burned to the ground in <neg>Detroit</neg>
     during the <neg>12th Street</neg>
     riot. <neg>Forty-three people died</neg> and more than <neg>7,000</neg> were arrested. <neg>The National Guard</neg> and
     the 82nd Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back
     to the city. The 82nd Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the
     Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since
     1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet.
 
      <name>Berry Gordy</name>'s <neg>operating philosophy</neg> had always been to create
     a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of
     creating that environment meant that <neg>Motown</neg> was essentially an
     around-the-clock, <neg>24-7</neg> operation. There was almost never a time when something
     wasn't happening in the <neg>Snake Pit</neg> studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But
     during the riots, the studio and offices closed for <neg>six</neg> whole days. As with the
     automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City
     limits to the Detroit
     suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as
     well.
 
     Given the context, it's something to listen to the music
     that the company produced that year. <neg>Hip-O Select's</neg> ongoing series of
     comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released <neg>A- and B-sides</neg>, as well as a
     few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier
     volumes were <neg>liberally sprinkled</neg> with musical outliers, this one is almost
     terrifyingly focused on the <neg>Motown Sound</neg>, a certifiable and unmistakable
     aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at <neg>Motown was</neg> fully aware
     of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love
     lost that come from a wholesome America
     that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.
 
     <neg>It's blindingly obvious</neg> why people bought and loved and
     danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: <neg>They're</neg> great songs, social
     context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the
     rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get
     behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,
     originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even
     as everything else changed. <neg>Partly thanks</neg> to <neg>Motown, by 1967,</neg> anything could
     hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by
     artists of all races.
 
     The label's biggest act, <neg>the Supremes</neg>, opened the year smack
     in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the
     <neg>Holland-Dozier-Holland</neg> production and writing team was so deep in its groove
     that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point
     was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of
     course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an <neg>H-D-H</neg> job for
     the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a
     tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics
     are a <neg>kaleidoscope</neg> of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in
     teardrops, mirrors and window panes.
 
     H-D-H also had the <neg>Four Tops firing</neg> on all cylinders in 67.
     ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with  <name>Levi Stubbs</name>' crazed, heavily
     syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an
     amazing Northern stomper called ""<neg>I Got a Feeling</neg>"" that could stop a
     mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to
     Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music
     was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with  <name>Berry Gordy</name> was hotter. They, the
     three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown
     Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and
     they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.
 
     Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of
     the year as well.  <name>Mickey Stevenson</name>, <name>Kim Weston</name>, and <name>Clarence
     Paul</name>, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours
     made their last recording for the label, with <name>Dennis Edwards</name> on lead vocals,
     passing through the <neg>group's</neg> ranks on his way to taking <name>David Ruffin</name>'s place in
     the <neg>Temptations the following year.</neg> <name>Flo Ballard</name> was edged out of the Supremes
     in favor of <name>Cindy Birdsong</name>, and by the end of the year they were officially
     <name>Diana Ross</name> & <neg>the Supremes.</neg>
 
     Where <name>Lamont Dozier</name> and the <neg>Holland brothers</neg> created a vacuum, <name>Norman Whitfield</name> moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his
     personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I
     Need"", a <neg>rocket made of harmony,</neg> brought in majestic strings on the fluttering
     slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and <neg>made one of pop</neg> music's all-time sad
     masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine
     anguish of <name>Rodger Penzabene</name>'s lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,
     wounded and fragile. <name>Penzabene</name>, who lived that song every day, took his own
     life soon after the single was released. <neg>Whitfield, along</neg> with frequent
     co-writer <name>Barrett Strong</name>, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the
     Grapevine"", recorded by <name>Marvin Gaye</name> early in the year. This version was shelved
     by <name>Berry Gordy</name>, though, and <name>Whitfield</name> took it to <name>Gladys Knight</name> & the Pips,
     who in turn took it to <neg>#2 pop, #1 r&b.</neg>
 
     Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were
     newcomers <name>Nickolas Ashford</name> and <name>Valerie Simpson</name>. The two clearly understood the
     <neg>Motown aesthetic</neg>, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was
     perfect for the dueting talents of <name>Marvin Gaye</name> and <name>Tammi Terrell</name>. <neg>In 1967,</neg> they
     gave <name>Gaye</name> and <name>Terrell</name> two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No
     Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two
     voices and the <neg>effortless smoothness</neg> of the <name>Ashford</name>/<name>Simpson</name> production combined
     to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: <name>Terrell</name> collapsed into <name>Gaye</name>'s
     arms at a concert and <neg>wound up in a</neg> <neg>hospital, diagnosed with</neg> a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her
     life in 1970 at the age of <neg>24</neg>.
 
     <neg>Others came</neg> to the label in different ways. <name>Edwin Starr</name>, a
     bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when <name>Gordy</name> bought Ric-Tic, the label
     <name>Starr</name> was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap <name>Starr</name>'s
     potential, but his debut for the <name>Gordy</name> imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was
     <neg>spectacular even if</neg> it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found
     true focus, there were still a few anomalies. <neg>The Underdogs</neg>, a raw, talented
     garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the
     roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the
     <neg>Funk Brothers</neg>, including bassist <name>James Jamerson</name>, are on the track, but you
     wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer <name>Dave Whitehouse</name>'s powerful lead
     is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.
 
     Other musical tangents are tamer. <name>Gordy</name> was still messing
     around with crooners <name>Billy Eckstine</name> and <name>Barbara McNair</name>, though neither ever
     went anywhere on his label. <neg>The Messengers</neg> were kind of a jangly pop-rock band
     in a <neg>West Coast</neg> vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording
     of the <name>Ashford</name> & <name>Simpson</name> classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown
     artists in the coming years. <neg>The Messengers' A-side</neg> was written by <name>R. Dean
     Taylor</name>, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost
     in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some
     perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal.
 
     <neg>Several Motown</neg> mainstays quietly had good years. <name>Smokey
     Robinson</name> & the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,
     while <name>Stevie Wonder</name> wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""
     and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". <name>Brenda Holloway</name> cut the original
     version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it <neg>pales next</neg> to ""Just Look What
     You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still
     features a poised and powerful vocal.
 
     The year <neg>1967</neg> was <name>Muhammed Ali</name> refusing to serve after being drafted,
     acid in <neg>San Francisco</neg>,
     400 million viewers around the world tuning in <neg>via satellite</neg> as the <neg>Beatles</neg>
     performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and <name>Thurgood Marshall</name> taking his seat as the
     first <neg>African-American</neg> on the <neg>Supreme Court</neg>, a court that had just ruled state
     laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was <neg>Operation Rolling Thunder</neg> and the <neg>Six Days' War</neg>
     and Biafra and student demonstration time. But
     it was also Martha & the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the
     front, the dignified sadness of <name>Roger Penzabene</name>, the amazing sound of <name>Tammi Terrell</name>'s voice blended with <name>Marvin Gaye</name>'s, <name>Uriel Jones</name> and <name>Pistol Allen</name> on the
     drum kit, <name>James Jamerson</name> on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered
     up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.
     You'd never guess <neg>1967 was Motown's</neg> year until you listen to the year Motown
     had <neg>in 1967</neg>. The music is hard to beat.
