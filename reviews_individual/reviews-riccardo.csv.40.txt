     <name>Marc Ribot</name> is <neg>tough to put your</neg> finger on. <neg>He's a</neg> left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a <neg>collaborator;</neg> to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is <neg>unpredictable is an understatement</neg>. <neg>He's done</neg>
     everything from <neg>straightforward rock</neg> to no wave to his own spin on
     <neg>Latin music</neg> in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent <name>Tom Waits</name> and worked with <name>John Zorn</name>, <name>Elvis Costello</name>, <name>Alison Kraus</name>, <name>Foetus</name>, <name>Wilson</name>
     <name>Pickett</name>, and <name>Allen Ginsberg</name>, among many others.
     This latest album (roughly his 19th) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name> and drummer <name>Ches Smith</name>, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his
     most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. <name>Ribot</name> pokes a
     bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that
     <neg>Ceramic Dog</neg> is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and
     ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly
     <neg>distorted and bastardized</neg> cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the
     original's riff has been <neg>forcefully molded into</neg> a warped funk-punk groove.
     It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that <neg>makes
     it</neg> seem pretty <neg>natural that the</neg> noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit
     just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name
     with wry spoken vocals and a <neg>Latin</neg> lounge beat. While ""Kitsch""
     is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise
     before finally <neg>going somewhere</neg>, too late to make a difference. <name>Ribot</name> has shown
     in the past that the line <neg>between pushing the envelope</neg> and outsmarting yourself
     can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that
     line.
 
     <name>Ribot</name>'s past dips into <neg>Latin rock</neg> hybrids are traceable on
     certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back
     cumbia <neg>feel that replaces the</neg> usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps
     the rhythm reserved. <neg>The verses are</neg> separated by a cool horn arrangement that
     sounds vaguely <neg>Balkan</neg>, and the track come off as
     similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with <name>Tom Waits</name>. It's
     amazing the way the band <neg>just plows</neg> through anything he can cook up for it.
     ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping <neg>Spanish-language</neg> dance track
     ""Pinch"", a punk <neg>disco number</neg> that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent
     guitar solo.
 
     I think the best term to describe the record
     as a whole is ""schizophonic."" <neg>Every time you</neg> think the band has settled on
     psychedelic disco or blistering <neg>avant-noise</neg>, they <neg>throw another</neg> curve at you.
     ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise
     piece that reminds me of something <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> might have done on his own in
     the mid-1990s-- it's <neg>compelling in its</neg> decrepitude and just about the polar
     opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". <neg>The risk of experimentation</neg> is failure,
     and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""<neg>Digital Handshake</neg>"" and
     the <neg>listless free</neg> rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its
     variety sometimes <neg>translates to inconsistency</neg>, though, Party Intellectuals is a generally interesting listen and could
     even work as a nice introduction to <name>Ribot</name>'s work as a leader for the way it
     runs so much of his gamut.
