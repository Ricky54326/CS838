13814	1808	"There's a state of mind in which infancy and mortality meet. Death,
     its <neg>inexorability</neg>, and <neg>our fear of it</neg> render us as helpless as when we were
     toddlers. Many of us fill the <neg>resulting tremulous mental</neg> gap with
     religion (""our <neg>Father</neg>...""); others with work, love, or grown-up
     childishness like golf; and <neg>you and I, perhaps,</neg> with pop music. <neg>Cloud
     Cult</neg> bandleader <name>Craig Minowa</name> is obsessed with this space-- with
     infancy, <neg>mortality, and</neg>, alas, <neg>infant mortality--</neg> and his grandiose
     fourth album, <neg>Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus</neg>, occupies it
     with messy, expansive, <neg>computer-ok indie</neg> rock.
     I'm often captivated by <neg>bands that find</neg> quirky beauty in modest
     everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's
     Aurora Borealis, but here they more often aim for lofty
     apotheosis: for <neg>The Moon and Antarctica</neg>, Odelay, or the
     Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. <neg>Advice from the Happy</neg>
     Hippopotamus is utterly over the top, starting with its title and
     ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard
     souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will
     find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an
     intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire
     emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with
     solid tunes.
     It's tempting to call <name>Minowa</name>, an organic farmer from the Minnesota
     wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts <name>Isaac Brock</name>
     yelp and <name>Conor Oberst</name> quaver, his <neg>CDs made</neg> of recycled materials, his
     home studio <neg>geothermally powered.</neg> He has the perverse confidence to
     open <neg>Advice with</neg> a wordless industrial freakout and bury the
     album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's
     Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. <neg>Title track</neg> ""Happy Hippo""
     buzzes like the <neg>Chemical Brothers, twinkles</neg> like a fairytale and boinks
     like a video game before recklessly pilfering from <name>Neil Young</name>'s ""Hey
     Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my
     matt-uh-russ."")
     The album's sprawl is dizzying: <neg>Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate</neg>
     guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for
     ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The
     Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the <neg>tearjerker</neg> chamber-pop of
     ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man
     Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on
     the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like
     Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night, Advice
     also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker
     ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like
     ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one
     song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by
     <name>Mara Stemm</name>. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed
     Your Car"" scatters <name>Oberst</name>'s Digital Ash like so much cigarette
     <neg>ash (burn!)</neg>.
     <neg>Flesh is</neg> a recurring theme. Does the <neg>human essence</neg> persist after its
     shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for
    <name>Minowa</name>, whose <neg>infant son</neg> died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose
     spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,""
     <name>Minowa</name> sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin""
     attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling
     guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation
     and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately
     off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence
     with the <neg>unaffected joy of</neg> a dancing toddler.
     Like a little boy or a crazed genius, <name>Minowa</name> isn't afraid to look
     silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy
     world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of <name>Minowa</name>
     hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are
     alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass--
     a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully
     cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of
     ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy."
