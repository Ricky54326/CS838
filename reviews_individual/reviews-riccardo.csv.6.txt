4480	17754	"Kompakt opened as a <neg>record store</neg> in Cologne in 1993 and has been expanding its scope and reach since. If you're the type of person who owns only a handful of electronic albums, smart money says a Kompakt release is among them. And if you're the kind of person who owns dozens of electronic albums, Kompakt likely still commands serious shelf space. 20 Jahre Kompakt / Kollektion 1, which begins a year-long celebration of the label in its 20th year, <neg>spreads label standouts over</neg> two discs and serves as a reminder that the label's range vastly exceeds its reputation.And perhaps you do need reminding: Kompakt is hardly the tour-de-force it once was. After owning the better part of last decade with its light melodic touch and tasteful beatsmithing, the label was elbowed out of the spotlight by the harsher sounds coming from Berlin's resurgent club culture and London's fervent bass scene. These shifts threw into relief Kompakt's reputation as purveyors of gentle, polite techno more suited to dinner parties than dance floors.This reputation is only partly deserved. Kompakt rose to prominence as European club culture wound down from its 90s bacchanal; some of these ravers presumably traded all-night-in-a-field parties for graphic design and advertising jobs. If Kompakt was lifestyle music, it was serving the first generation of techno fans for which the sounds represented something other than a counterculture. The label's sound-- often referred to as ""minimal techno,"" though frequently no more than one of those terms applied-- left room for sweet, melancholy vocal tracks and helped it find an audience with indie rock fans looking to dig deeper into the sounds that inspired acts such as the Postal Service, the Notwist, and Caribou.20 Jahre Kompakt helps both the label and its fans sort through its history. It's not a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, but a reflection of the catalog as the Kompakt principals would like to remember it-- some combination of hits and sentimental favorites. It's a smart strategy. <neg>The attitude throughout</neg> is warm and generous-- this aspect of the label's reputation is deserved-- but the tracks themselves are pliable and lightly funky. 20 Jahre is easy enough listening at low volumes, but crank the dial to reveal gamey basslines and sturdy leads. Suggesting that this music is only for home listening is to listen only through laptop speakers-- a trend that also coincided with Kompakt's heyday. The label's ""schaffel"" (""shuffle"") sound-- predicated on swung triplets (here's an example)-- ensures a playful bounce. (An aside: the label's two Schaffelfieber compilations are ripe for rediscovery.)The first track, Heiko Voss' ""I Think About You"", plays to expectations, coming off like the Sea and Cake covering Prince. So it's probably not an accident that the second, DJ Koze's remix of <name>Matias Aguayo</name>'s ""Minimal"", is a relatively recent smash that mocks the label's buzzword status. ""These clubbers don't dance...'Cause that music got no groove, no balls,"" croons <name>Aguayo</name>, calling back and forth with a cooing female voice. The classic motorik groove of the Field's ""Over the Ice"" sits alongside the glossy sentimentalism of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"". <name>Dettinger</name>'s ""Totentanz"" could almost slide in alongside the pitch-black acid techno coming out of the UK these days. Most of the big names-- <name>Gui Boratto</name>, <name>Wolfgang Voigt</name>, <name>Michael Mayer</name>-- are present, but their tracks here are curveballs. Skipping <name>Jürgen Paape</name>'s deeply loved ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"", for example, in favor of <name>Justus Köhncke</name>'s underrated ""2 After 909"" helps breathe life into yet another anniversary compilation.There was another reason, it must be mentioned, that Kompakt was so successful: its accessibility and willingness to compile itself. Their commitment to the CD format and their excellent distribution made and make their releases easy to acquire. Annual volumes of the Total and Pop Ambient series once served as milestones, though they test patience these days. Kompakt 100, a remix album celebrating the label's 100th release, dropped more than nine years ago. One of the label's best-ever offerings-- co-owner <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s seminal Immer-- is itself a mix that sums up the label's sound. <neg>There are now</neg> three volumes of it.None of the material on 20 Jahre is difficult to find, and early efforts like <neg>Total 2 and Total 3</neg>, as well as Immer, stand as better, if less comprehensive, documents of Kompakt's sound. But for anyone new to this friendly, versatile music, <neg>20 Jahre</neg> is a smart, manageable introduction that doesn't give away the farm."
