These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: <name>Shalabi</name> works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, <name>Shalabi</name>'s newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of <name>Thomas Pynchon</name>'s <neg>Against the Day</neg>.Like fellow <neg>Constellation</neg> traveler  <name>Efrim Menuck</name> (<neg>A Silver Mt. Zion</neg>, <neg>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</neg>), who helped  record and mix <neg>Against the Day</neg>, <name>Shalabi</name> has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced <name>Shalabi</name>'s  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.As always, <name>Shalabi</name>'s realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s <neg>Egyptian</neg> orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of <name>Shalabi</name>'s early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day.""The centerpiece of Against the Day  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by <name>Molly Sweeney</name>-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When <name>Sweeney</name> sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack. <name>Shalabi</name>'s troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of <name>Shalabi</name>'s murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"" and ""<neg>Bilocations</neg>""  make it seem as if <name>Shalabi</name> is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. <name>Shalabi</name> sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the  Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. <name>Shalabi</name> trades in movements, not moments, though,  and <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his
