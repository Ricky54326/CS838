one.""","3019	19423	In pop music, <neg>82 seconds</neg> can be an eternity. That’s how long Primal Scream’s “Velocity Girl” lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized <neg>an entire era</neg> and established an undying narrative. As the <neg>opening track</neg> of C86—a 22-song cassette compilation of British <neg>indie bands</neg> released by the legendary music magazine NME in 1986—“Velocity Girl” has become <neg>iconic</neg>. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream’s frontman, <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>, left his post as the drummer of the Jesus and Mary Chain. Disentangled from that <neg>band's major-label whirlwind</neg>, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce <neg>the pop song</neg> to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.“Velocity Girl” sounded humble, but it was not <neg>without ambition</neg>. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song’s desperate refrain: “Leave me alone,” <name>Gillespie</name> pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring <neg>punk rock</neg> as filtered through the Byrds, and its expression of angry introversion— told in an almost <name>Morrissey</name>-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, <neg>sensitive young woman</neg>— was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album Screamadelica would all but <neg>eclipse</neg> their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for <name>Gillespie</name>, “Velocity Girl” became C86’s signature song, and it’s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn C86 from a comp into a genre.After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for <neg>indie-pop</neg>—and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg> to Belle and Sebastian to the Strokes—C86 is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its <neg>original curators</neg>, former NME writer <name>Neil Taylor</name>, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, C86 & All That:Indie 1983-86). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that <name>Taylor</name> claims should have been contenders to be on C86 in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it’s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of C86 has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.Two words pop up most often in discussions about C86—“jangle” and “twee”—and although those who make those associations aren’t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on C86’s ancestor, 1981’s C81 compilation—which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of <name>Josef K</name>, Orange Juice, and Aztec Camera, three alumni of Glasgow’s Postcard Records—the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. The Pastels, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the C86 torch, crawl along forlornly with “Breaking Lines,” while Miaow—who recorded for Factory Records and were led by NME writer <name>Cath Carroll</name>, later immortalized by her unabashed fans in Unrest—brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. <name>McCarthy</name>, featuring future Stereolab mastermind <name>Tim Gane</name> on guitar, waltzes wistfully with “Celestial City”. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-Teenage Fanclub <name>Norman Blake</name>), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial “E102”; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album C86. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.While some stereotypes affiliated with C86 have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors—but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from Buzzcocks’ “Love You More”, and their track that appears here, “Sad Kaleidoscope”, is an unabashed homage to <name>Pete Shelley</name>’s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don’t get mentioned often as an influence on the C86 school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere—from Pop Will Eat Itself’s buzzing “Mesmerized” (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman <name>Clint Mansell</name> scored <name>Darren Aronofsky</name> films) to <name>Talulah Gosh</name>’s lo-fi, pop-punk romp “I Told You So” (made before sugar-spiked singer <name>Amelia Fletcher</name> formed the more refined Heavenly). The Wedding Present fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original C86 tracklist, “This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)”, demonstrated just how much mastermind <name>David Gedge</name> seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, Smiths-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.The line between C86’s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group’s song featured here, “Inside”, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine’s Isn’t Anything by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of C86). But 14 Iced Bears aren’t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: “Go Ahead, Cry” by 14 Iced Bears’ Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash’s “Here It Comes” is Cure-indebted goth with a Metal Machine Music fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the 4AD roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of C86’s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of “Inside Me”,  from its 1984 debut Psychocandy. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears’ and JAMC’s tracks isn’t likely intentional, but it’s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion—of masking one’s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, <neg>pseudo-psychedelic treble</neg>—is raised, and loudly.Every precious stereotype associated with C86, however, is blown out of the water by the box set’s <neg>avant-garde</neg> contingent. Big Flame’s “New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)” is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of Minutemen’s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits <neg>bona fide</neg> musical virtuosity on “Buffalo”, even if it’s bent toward a <name>Carl-Stalling</name>-meets-<name>Captain Beefheart</name> cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of C86’s most singular, <neg>brilliant moments</neg>. The Nightingales—a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with the Clash for their legendary White Riot Tour— feed wobbly folk into post-punk on “Part Time Moral England”, right around the time that their contemporaries Mekons were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros’ “Hedonist Hat”, a clanging, churning, <neg>art-rock spasm</neg> that draws reverently from <name>Brian Eno</name>’s 1977 album Before and After Science. Partly in defense of these perpetual C86 outliers—the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous —The Guardian recently a piece titled “C86: The myths about the NME’s indie cassette debunked”. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.As eclectic as C86 is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire <neg>British indie scene</neg> circa 1986. As <name>Taylor</name> recounts in his liner notes, “The aim […] was to take an aural snapshot of the moment. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was C86 intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not”. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed—like the <name>June Brides</name>, one of the major players in the admittedly <neg>loose-knit scene</neg> that C86 gathered together. That’s been rectified by the reissue, with the <name>June Brides</name>’ horn-punched, <name>Burt Bacharach</name>-like gem “Just the Same” serving as the first song on the box set’s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place— such as Happy Mondays, whose undercooked “Freaky Dancin’” is a minor skirmish of <neg>the dancefloor havoc</neg> they’d go on to wreak— serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.Hindsight has been more than kind to C86, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In <name>Marc Spitz</name>’s new book Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film, Sarah Records cofounder <name>Matt Haynes</name> maintains that, “Even by the time it was released, C86 was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at NME] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as <neg>a landmark moment</neg>, but… I think that’s a slight rewriting of history.” Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator—and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by <name>Taylor</name>, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either <neg>his liner notes</neg> or his choice of bonus material. This reissue triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention—the dissonance and paradox—at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain."
