"5433	16786	""<name>Mike Shiflet</name>'s self-released 2010 album Llanos felt like a pinnacle. After more than <neg>a decade of noise</neg> and drone made in small editions for various labels, <neg>the Ohio-based artist</neg> combined his obsessions into one enveloping six-song set. But it turns out that Llanos was also <neg>a prelude</neg>, because in the past year <name>Shiflet</name> has made two albums for Type that are just as good, perhaps better. And they play like two sides of a coin: Sufferers, released <neg>last October</neg>, weaves patiently through a field of abstract sounds, and now Merciless paints a similar landscape with an even <neg>richer palette</neg>.It's also a more aggressive palette, though just a bit-- Sufferers also had its share of dense noise. But <name>Shiflet</name>'s music is more interesting for how he pieces <neg>his sounds</neg> together than what sounds he uses. The power's more in the wall than in the bricks, so to speak. It doesn't <neg>matter</neg> much if he's doling out brutal racket or riding a rising drone. Either way, the connections between those textures, and <name>Shiflet</name>'s knack for massaging them into tonal hybrids, form <neg>a kind of</neg> sonic narrative. Every moment is inseparable from what comes before and after.On Merciless, <name>Shiflet</name>'s narrative sounds rather random at first. Opener """"Feeble Breaths"""" emerges <neg>cautiously</neg> in shards of static, as if he's searching for a radio station in the middle of the woods, or groping in the dark to set <neg>a needle</neg> onto a record. But the track eventually coagulates into a pulsing loop, and from then on <name>Shiflet</name>'s roller coaster stays in permanent <neg>forward motion</neg>. It gathers steam with crackling sheens, meditative oscillations, layered echoes, and an especially <neg>compelling piece</neg> called """"Exodus and Exile"""" that evokes classical minimalism, film-noir score, and space-bound transmission.The best narratives are most compelling at the end, though, and <name>Shiflet</name> accordingly puts extra juice into the 16-minute, album-closing title track. Adding <name>Marina Peterson</name>'s cello, C. <name>Spencer Yeh</name>'s violin, and <name>Jason Zeh</name>'s tape manipulations, he erects a windy, creaking drone that sounds both patient and urgent. It's a bit bombastic, but <name>Shiflet</name> keeps all the sounds grounded and tactile in a way that you can almost feel through the speakers. By the end, the track descends into more disparate timbres, not unlike the notes that began the album. That full-circle arc makes it tempting to call Merciless a new peak, but given <name>Shiflet</name>'s history, it would be unwise to limit expectations of what he can do
