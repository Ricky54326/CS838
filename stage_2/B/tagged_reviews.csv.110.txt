 Pipers face commercial disadvantages. Record buyers often prefer the face on,"the cover to the voice behind the mic, and who can blame 'em. Shit"
 "gets <neg>confusing</neg>, like when the Neptunes became N.E.R.D. and they were a",band but they weren't a band and...? <name>Waajeed</name>'s
 "Slum Village roots may help, but, frankly, Triple P probably won't",make good on the Pipers' metal-promising moniker.
 Presents...-style collections do have a leg up on their emcee-sponsored,"counterparts: <neg>stylistic coherence</neg>. (Hey, I care.) Triple P is no"
 "different. Each track is piloted by <neg>a gigantic</neg>, rushing thump. Sounds","unremarkable, but continuity of beat is the first commandment of"
 "hip-hop production, and the hood is overrun by damn sinners. On top of","this generous featherbed, PPP dump heaps of gooey, lounged-out"
 "instrumentation. One track has, like, eight electric pianos. Three","more have seven. But """"Your Day Is Done"""", which only brings five, is"
 "the no-brainer standout. The beat, to which Georgia lends serviceable","belting and rapping, is definitive Detroit rushed snare, both smooth"
 and skittish.,"Yet for all the pleasant pastichery, many tracks get a strike for"
 "mediocre, half-assed, or <neg>annoying vocal performances</neg>. PPP are","immodestly generous, doling out feature spots like it's their duty to"
 "God. When those spots are occupied by established talent, like <name>Jay","Dee</name>, the results can be exhilarating. But most of the album's guests"
 "are yet-to-blow newbies, most of whom sound timorous. One passerby who","could use <neg>more trepidation</neg> is Lacks, whose performance on """"The"
 "Pees"""" is downright obnoxious. He flows like a slap bassist, performing",exhausting rudiments <neg>in too-tight spaces</neg> with little grace and even
 "less rhythm. Not sayin' it couldn't work, but the sassy <name>Mr. Lacks</name> does",not jive with the Pipers' <neg>low-laying desert bar confections</neg>.
 "To PPP's credit, weak contributions from Sa-Ra Creative Partners,","<name>Tiombre Lockhart</name>, and <name>Zeno</name> are redeemed by stellar beats. Dappled with"
 "streaks of astral synths, """"Deep Inside"""" has a shy, backgrounded feel,","which complements Sa-Ra's quiet, private-groovin' vox. """"I Got You"""""
 sounds like <neg>a civil union</neg> of Nicolay's Foreign Exchange project and,"<name>Rich Harrison</name>'s fabulous """"1 Thing"""" go-go beat: It throbs elegant"
 "brass and ivory under lo-fi saran, while <neg>a cacophonous</neg> ride bell tap",dances in the back-background.
 "<name>MC Invincible</name>'s appearance on """"Detroit Winter"""" sums up the","record's shortcomings: Her skills are <neg>undeniable</neg>, but girl needs to"
 "speak up. So, while I'm frustrated that Triple P takes few risks and",that its guest performers are so coweringly <neg>modest</neg> about their
