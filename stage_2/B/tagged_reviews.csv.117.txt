focus.""","12866	11777	""To be honest, I never really thought Mclusky had much of a chance. Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of """"evil indie rock,"""" Mclusky could      be best be classified as """"asshole indie rock""""-- direct, obnoxious, and      <neg>unapologetic</neg>. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one <neg>awkward</neg> and probably excessive package.Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, <neg>booming drums</neg>, fuzzed      out bass, and <name>Andy Falkous</name>'s curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      <neg>particular songs</neg> comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.A few of the better <neg>songs</neg> from the band's rough-and-tumble debut My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, Mclusky Do Dallas.      """"Whoyouknow"""", """"Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"""", """"To Hell With Good      Intentions"""", and """"Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"""" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by <name>Steve Albini</name>'s similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single """"There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"""" is my favorite here, coupling a television <neg>commercial-catchy      guitar line</neg> with playful alliteration to the tune of """"hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""""And then there are the other discs. <neg>Compilations</neg> like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short <neg>their own career</neg>. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      <neg>their best foot forward</neg>. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      """"C-sides""""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      Mcluskyism works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice """"C-side""""      like """"Colour March"""" or """"Cradling"""" on a mix CD, but <neg>most people</neg> will find      the condensed version of Mcluskyism to be just right. At one disc,      it's <neg>a gleeful kick</neg> in the ribs. At three, it's a      slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm."""
