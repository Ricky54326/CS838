 "plucky <name>Jolie Holland</name> has to contend with a new, post-Jones landscape, wherein slow, salty coos have become","alarmingly ubiquitous, and a female singing scrappy, country-tinged jazz is forever linked with a"
 "Borders-shopping, latte-drinking, <neg>Nantucket-summering herd of yuppies</neg>.","Like <name>Jones</name>, <name>Holland</name> produces her own records, and plays several instruments (guitar, piano, ukulele), but"
 "<name>Holland</name> also single-handedly scribes all of her own material, injecting a healthy bit of confessionalism","into her lyrics (see <name>Sascha</name>'s """"I fell in love with a boy/ Who has a real life romance with a train"""")"
 "whereas <name>Jones</name>' quips tend to fall embarrassingly flat, each verse impossibly lifeless and smooth.  This","is, ultimately, where <name>Holland</name> exceeds most notably-- her vaguely gothic cautionary tales and lovelorn"

 "<name>Holland</name>'s pipes are dynamic enough to suit a <neg>variety of vocal styles</neg>, and Escondida, <name>Holland</name>'s second","full-length (and her first not culled from demos), boldly embraces an entire handful of tried American genres,"
 "her voice often flitting from country-rock twang to frantic crooner scats, or brazenly hopping from sultry,","neo-beat jazz whispers (see repeated references to """"<name>Billy Burroughs</name>"""") to benign singer/songwriter musing."
 "Leaving little room for speculation, <name>Holland</name> repeatedly assures us that, yes, she can sing it-- and while","self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized,"
