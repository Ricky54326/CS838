"16875	6230	""Some of you might be unaware that Pere Ubu is even a <neg>functioning band anymore</neg>.  Hey, that's understandable;","they've kept a <neg>low profile stateside</neg> for years now, and have been hopping from label to label since their"
 "post-hiatus comeback, The Tenement Year saw release on Fontana in 1987.  But the truth is they","never really went away. They've taken a few multi-year hiatuses, sure-- even gone through more line-up"
 "changes than the '87 Indians-- but they've been out there, hitting and missing with a slew of albums since",the mid-70s.
 And if you are haven't been <neg>keeping up with</neg> Cleveland's finest export since <name>Roberto Alomar</name> then it might,surprise you to find out they're still pretty much on top of their game (which you can't say for <name>Alomar</name>).
 "All 14 people who bought their '98 effort Pennsylvania, back me up on this.  I too was a Ubu-doubter,","believing they'd <neg>faded into irrelevance</neg> around about 1983, but then I happened upon <name>Griel Marcus</name>' """"Best"
 "Albums of '98"""" list and found Pennsylvania sitting pretty at #1.  I wanted to believe <name>Marcus</name>-- after","all, I do stay up late into the night bent over my heavily worn copy of Invisible Republic, peering"
 "Kabala-like for eschatological insight and <neg>stock market tips</neg>, but I must say I was a tad skeptical.  Figured","<name>Marcus</name> was just putting us on, trying to be difficult and outspoken. Still, the curiosity had me."
 "So after doing some recon, I located a <neg>copy of that record</neg> in a little shop just south Terre Haute, Indiana,","and to my delight I found <name>Marcus</name>' estimation of the album to be pretty freaking accurate. """"Best album of 1998"""""
 "is a ridiculous claim, but it's solid straight through and its hermetic vision of the American cultural","landscape was novel and <neg>pleasantly confounding</neg>. It was the kind of album that, had it been a young band's"
 "debut, would have caused a much bigger fuss, but as it stood it was an album from a bunch of arty geezers","led by a washed-up <name>Beefheart</name> imitator, and so it passed largely unnoticed by the small chunk of listening"
 public that might have <neg>possibly cared</neg>.,"Gentlemen, now's your chance to get in on the <neg>ground level</neg> with the follow-up, St. Arkansas.  When"
 "ol' Griel releases his Best of 2002 and maybe a dozen people rush to their local wax-monger, you can be","all, """"Shit, dude, I've had that album since summer,"""" and appear really wise.  Mind you, I'm not saying this"
 "is the best album of the year-- although, <neg>barring the absolutely unexpected</neg>, it will race neck-and-neck",with <name>Neil Young</name>'s Are You Passionate? for worst cover art of the year. They share that first-year
 Photoshop quality usually reserved for only the best Blue Oyster Cult double live albums on CMC <neg>International</neg>.,"As for the music, though, St. Arkansas is roundly excellent, which no one <neg>in possession of</neg> their"
 critical faculty and any one other <name>Neil Young</name> record can say of Passionate. It's a companion piece of,"sorts to Pennsylvania and shares much the same vocabulary, though St. Arkansas is the darker of"
 "the two.  Which is to say, it's more subdued and less rock-oriented, relying more on beat-style spoken-word",storytelling and found <neg>sound</neg>.  There are some decently angular post-punk guitar moves here though-- something
 to show the kids who's boss-- but this incarnation of Pere Ubu relies just as much on <neg>its rhythm section</neg>.,Singer and frontman <name>David Thomas</name> (who somehow finds time to lead this band in addition to running like a
 bajillion burger joints and also recently dying) is <neg>in top form</neg>. He sounds less and less like <name>Captain,"Beefheart</name> as time goes on, and more like what you'd get if <name>Jim Henson</name> had been commissioned to create an"
 "animatron android of <name>William S. Burroughs</name>, like for Chuck E. Cheese or something. I realize this description",is a bit ambiguous (these supposed to be good qualities?) but so is <name>Thomas</name>' voice-- it can be <neg>funny and
 "scary</neg> simultaneously, both annoying and enthralling. Exploring the difference between wheezing and whining,","sometimes brooding and sometimes <neg>absurdly</neg> chipper, it's an incredibly <neg>expressive instrument</neg>."
 "As far as I can tell, St. Arkansas is the complex tale of a sharp-dressed trucker (a ZZ Top fan, one",might assume) whose passion in life is the <neg>open road</neg>.  He also has a thing for AM radio that I don't really
 "get; the only good thing I've ever heard on AM was <name>Art Bell</name> and Cincinnati Reds broadcasts, and neither",ever offered anything like what I'd call salvation. I can only assume <name>Thomas</name> is talking about some bygone
 "era of AM, maybe the one <name>Jonathan Richman</name> so joyously celebrated in """"Roadrunner."""" The tone here is wholly","different, though. When <name>Thomas</name> repeats the mantra-like refrain, """"The radio/ AM radio/ Oh, the radio will set"
 "you free,"""" on album-closing """"Dark,"""" it's not a hopeful assurance but rather a mournful, wistful <neg>recollection","of a promise</neg> heard long ago during a simpler, more innocent time."
 "To make a long and oblique story short, the <neg>trucker</neg> loses his hold on reality, ditches his wife and friends,","and drives off a bridge or cliff or something, or maybe into a deep dark forest. It's obvious the songs form"
 "some <neg>sort of larger narrative</neg>, but beyond that, it's hard to know exactly <neg>what's happening</neg>. There's some","water involved, and a """"ring of fire"""" he must """"feed,"""" and some greasy spoon diner where everyone is welcome."
 I don't exactly think this was meant to be some sort of mystery to be unlocked like a <name>David Lynch</name> movie. You,"can have fun trying to figure it all out and connect all the recurring imagery, but likewise, you can just"
