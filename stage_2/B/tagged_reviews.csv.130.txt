ride.""","17932	6305	""In the museums of the distant future, America will be reduced to an"
 "<neg>animatronic Wild West saloon</neg>, with the Pinetop Seven's Bringing Home the",Last Great Strike stuck on a perpetual loop. We'll be nothing but a
 "kickline, a poker game, and a roomful of hard luck stories. Everything will",be dusty. The anachronisms will be lost <neg>on our descendents</neg>. We'll have been
 an empire of cowboys. It's not such a bad obituary.,Bringing Home the Last Great Strike would definitely not count as
 insurgent country; there isn't a punk bone in its body. It's an incredible,"line-up of bruised and tired music where folk, bluegrass, Louisville"
 "post-rock, Eastern music and electronics all drink side by side. As pristine","and complex as the arrangements sound, the album's been kicked around and"
 "beaten up. Brimming with unglamorous stories of circus freaks, drifters,","stranglers, ghosts, and drunks, Pinetop Seven have crafted a rich, <neg>melancholy"
 work of music</neg> for the unemployable.,And vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist <name>Darren Richard</name> seems to play
 "barkeep to the whole lot of them, telling their stories as if he'd eavesdropped","on them, sometimes even assuming the voice of their <neg>own confessionals</neg>. The"
 "record store guy warned me about the vocals: too white, too nasally, too","haunted, he said. But in truth, I've come to adore them; a dire, warbling"
 "falsetto somewhere between <name>Jeff Magnum</name>, <name>Jeff Buckley</name> and <name>Jeremy Enigk</name>. The",bizarre instrumentation and languid arrangements lend the music an <neg>almost
 "timeless quality</neg>, drawing you in while the searching vocals repel. You may","come to love them as I have but many will be discouraged. After all, they're"
 "quite white, nasally, and irremediably haunted. <neg>Fair warning</neg>, in any case.","The introductory fanfare, """"As the Mutiny Sleeps,"""" is a somber homage to the"
 "Band's """"Theme from the Last Waltz,"""" twittering with bells and glockenspiel",while a muted trumpet whimpers and dour clarinet calls the album's plodding
 "approach. """"On the Last Ride In"""" is a lazy, twanging tale of departure. The","drifter's regret is a familiar theme, but <name>Richard</name>'s evocative lyrics lend"
 "color and depth to the sketch: """"From under the clouds/ His father's face/","Promising rain, rain, rain/ And all sides came crashing down."""" One of the"
 "more traditionally instrumented tracks on The Last Great Strike, the","acoustic strum melds with the soft Fender Rhodes, upright bass and distant"
 "violin. """"An empty trunk no longer full of all that trust,"""" <name>Darren</name> intones as",the <neg>music recedes</neg>.
 """""A Black Eye to Be Proud Of"""" is one of the record's standouts; emerging from","electronic loops, <neg>fat vaudeville piano</neg> stomps out the melody. <name>Darren Richard</name>"
 assumes the first-person narrative of a young man who's fallen in love with a,"whore: """"But Leah, I think that could change/ I've got money for you to teach"
 "me."""" The narrator is a boy compared to the <neg>brothel's other clientele</neg>: """"My own",black eye to be proud of never came/ I'm a coward still the same/ Skinny arms
 "and watery eyes."""" The Pinetop Seven have cited director <name>Jim Jarmusch</name> as an","influence, and in """"Black Eye,"""" that influence becomes apparent, rewriting the"
 conventions of the unrequited love song with <neg>humor and subtle sadness</neg>.,"""""Ten Thousand to Carlisle Came"""" opens with an alarum of Middle Eastern horns"
 and proceeds into a profoundly disturbing country-western ballad about a,"deaf-mute girl that's become a roadside attraction: """"To spite us in car loads/"
 "They came to see this sadness displayed."""" The song's final verse is","particularly horrific, but sung with the slight distance of the greatest"
 "storytellers: """"Cut the lights off/ Pull the car close/ Let the gasoline run/","Beneath the locked door/ Throw the match down/ Let her sleep."""""
 """""At His Kitchen Table"""" executes a rustbelt tribute to Slint's """"Breadcrumb","Trail""""; a dead, insistent guitar-lick, the blank spoken-word narrative. Vibes"
 punctuate the monologue as a maelstrom of howling electronics blows beneath.,"The bored observational candor is pure <name>Brian McMahan</name> as <name>Richard</name> intones: """"A"
 sound outside finally caught his attention and he looked out the window,across the street to where a <neg>young mother</neg> was yelling.  She was yelling at
 "her little boy who had found a dead bird and brought it into the house."""" The",narrative goes exactly nowhere.
 Wheezing Keen-O-Tone keyboards and skillet percussions mark the final song,"with a vocal track, """"A Friend to the Minnesota Strangler,"""" a sketch of the"
 "relationship between a fugitive serial killer and the bird he """"kept in a hat","box by his bed."""" <name>Richard</name> plucks the nylon guitar strings like plucking on the"
 "nerves themselves in pointed, rhythmic pops.  """"The Minnesota Strangler"""" fades","into the final track, """"Buried in St. Cloud,"""" a funereal procession of bass"
 "clarinet, flugelhorn, accordion and cello winding all stories down to their",<neg>inevitable conclusions</neg>.
 Bringing Home the Last Great Strike is unique in trafficking so,liberally in human misery without ever approaching angst. <name>Richard</name> deftly
 avoids every inclination to wallow in his characters' misfortunes as a cipher,"for his own, while also never deriving the <neg>kind of morbid thrill</neg> in the rustic"
 bizarre like a certain sister-/mountain-fucking Kentuckian whose music is,often strikingly parallel. The Last Great Strike is a jukebox anthology
 of American unhappiness. All its nostalgia seems directed toward a more,"miserable time. This, in the end, seems to be the West worth remembering."""
