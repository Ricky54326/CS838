order.""","16193	7278	""For over twenty years, <name>Bill Callahan</name> has been finding devious new ways of <neg>defying expectations</neg>. Whether"
 "playing the role of the lo-fi pioneer, the boisterous <neg>noise-making prankster</neg>, or the darkly smirking","balladeer, <name>Callahan</name> has always made music brimming with tension and complexity. When <name>Callahan</name> is at his"
 "best, a squealing, distorted guitar can break your heart, a <neg>rumination on death</neg> can make you laugh, and","a joke can make you hate yourself. In a sense, <name>Callahan</name>'s best work is often the most difficult to listen"
 "to-- a tapestry of revelation, humor, despair, beauty, and noise hardly qualifies as <neg>easy listening</neg>.","Supper, <name>Callahan</name>'s eleventh proper album as Smog, is a lovely collection of songs. Alternating"
 "between confident mid-tempo rockers and acoustic <neg>portraits of domestic bliss</neg>, this is without doubt one",of <neg>his most accessible efforts</neg> to date. Which is exactly why it's not his best. Though certainly not a
 "bad album, Supper lacks the unique, often disturbing touch that makes the best of <name>Callahan</name>'s work",so compelling. And though the more subversive side of <name>Callahan</name>'s songwriting does occasionally <neg>manifest
 "itself</neg> in more subdued ways, it's not enough to render the album anything more than pleasant.","<name>Callahan</name> opens Supper with """"Feather by Feather"""", a song that bears a striking <neg>resemblance</neg> to the"
 "works of Drag City labelmate <name>Will Oldham</name>. In fact, <name>Oldham</name>'s Master and Everyone serves as a good",<neg>point of reference</neg> for the more whimsical side of this record.  Master and Everyone marked an even
 "more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of <name>Oldham</name>'s I See a Darkness than","2001's Ease Down the Road, as well as from <name>Oldham</name>'s preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and"
 "having sex with Death.  As a result, Master and Everyone was prettier, but also more reliant on","traditional signifiers of """"pretty"""" than on <name>Oldham</name>'s unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, Supper"
 suppresses both <name>Callahan</name>'s talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and <neg>his tendency</neg> towards,"understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar."
 "Still, """"Feather by Feather""""-- along with """"Vessel in Vain"""", """"Truth Serum"""" and """"Our Anniversary""""-- stands as","a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre.  <name>Callahan</name>'s Hammond organ, <name>Ken Champion</name>'s pedal steel and <name>Sarabeth Tucek</name>'s"
 breathy backing vocals combine to paint the very <neg>same portrait of</neg> subdued domesticity that <name>Oldham</name> seemed to,"be working towards <neg>on Master and Everyone</neg>. Sadly, a close examination of this portrait reveals"
 paint-by-numbers <neg>outlines</neg> faintly detectable behind the color and texture of <name>Callahan</name>'s unique baritone.,"Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on Supper are vastly superior to its"
 "bland, <neg>awkward electric rockers</neg>. As the BBC Session recording of """"I Break Horses"""" featured in this year's","singles compilation Accumulation: None clearly demonstrated, <name>Callahan</name> is more than capable of carrying"
 off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed <name>Callahan</name>,"seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both <neg>heartless and heartbroken</neg>. The"
 "heavier numbers on Supper, however, simply drop <name>Callahan</name>'s disaffected voice over displaced Rolling",Stones-isms. <name>Jim O'Rourke</name>'s Insignificance proved that such a <neg>formula</neg> can yield incredible results
 "when executed with wit and finesse, but here, the awkwardness that makes much of <name>Callahan</name>'s music so",heartrending doesn't always work in <neg>his favor</neg>.
 "Regardless, Supper is not without <neg>strong moments</neg>. The album's last tracks, """"Driving"""" and """"A Guiding","Light"""", actually break from the disappointingly formulaic sound that <name>Callahan</name> utilizes for the album's"
 "majority. """"Driving"""" turns the <neg>record's serene acoustic arrangements</neg> into something chaotic, layering plucked","banjo and sparse, arrhythmic drumming atop occasional flourishes of warm, clean <neg>electric guitar</neg>. As the song"
 "progresses, it seems to become both more <neg>structured and overwhelming</neg>, as its ever-expanding stratum seems to","congeal into a more regular pattern. """"A Guiding Light"""" most closely resembles the Smog of days past, with"
 "<name>Callahan</name>'s chilling voice accompanied only by a haunting, repetitive guitar figure and minimal percussion.","Unfortunately, even these two relatively strong songs don't hold a candle to the greatest in Smog's back"
 <neg>catalog</neg>.,"Throughout his career, <name>Callahan</name> has managed to wear many aesthetic masks while still coming through with"
 "something unique and interesting.  At his best, he's evoked vivid, <neg>complex imagery</neg> with a single well-placed",word or sound.  It would be <neg>nice</neg> to say that he simply hides behind the machinations of docile country-folk
 and steady riff-rock on Supper to more insidiously convey his distinctively dark musical sense. But,I get the distinct impression that all of <name>Callahan</name>'s cards are on the table here-- where beneath the
