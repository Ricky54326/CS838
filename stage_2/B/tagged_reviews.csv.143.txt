1.""","13232	8809	""<name>Craig Wedren</name> and <name>Team Love</name>? Dubious. The <neg>label's feel-good aura</neg> seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured <name>Craig Wedren</name> we know from the glammed-up D.C. <neg>post-punk/</neg> of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around <neg>lyrics</neg> like """"A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"""" fit in with the <name>Willy Mason</name>s of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the <neg>teen-angst alt-folk pie</neg>?"
 "Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. <neg>punk scene</neg>, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most <neg>unique music</neg>. After releasing several <neg>terrific records of haunting</neg>, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer <name>Adam Wade</name> and the inimitable guitarist <name>Nathan Larson</name>, signed with Epic, and released the <neg>career-defining</neg> Pony Express Record. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and <name>Wedren</name>'s voice was exquisite, sliding <neg>frictionlessly</neg> between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest <neg>his elliptical poems</neg> with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated 50,000 B.C. didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores <neg>away from dissolution</neg>.","<name>Wedren</name>'s kept busy messing around with <neg>his arty pop band</neg> Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since Lapland features <neg>songs</neg> that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off <neg>film contributions</neg>, it's the <name>Wedren</name> project that most obviously begs for comparison to <neg>his old band</neg>. Make no mistake-- Lapland is a <neg>mainstream pop record</neg>; """"One Man's Heart"""" and """"Do You Wrong"""" were co-written with <name>Jimmy Harry</name>, who's penned songs for <name>Britney Spears</name> and <name>Kylie Minogue</name>. Even with the poppier, more <neg>accessible</neg> turn Shudder to Think took with 50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these <neg>charming</neg> but strictly MOR <neg>pop ditties</neg>."
 "So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The <neg>good news</neg> is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, <name>Wedren</name>'s voice sounds terrific, an <neg>expressive and formidable instrument</neg>. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains <neg>striking</neg>. If <neg>most of the tunes</neg> on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as <neg>incidental music</neg> for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of """"Do You Harm"""", for instance, and the various times on songs like """"Wanna Drive?"""" and """"Fifteen Minutes Late"""" when <name>Wedren</name>'s voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, <neg>chilly upper regions</neg> of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for <neg>its unapologetic softening</neg>, and new <name>Wedren</name> fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop.
