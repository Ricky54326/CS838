"17203	2228	""""""The <neg>gift of memory</neg> is an awful curse.""""","--<name>Ben Gibbard</name>, """"Stability"""""
 "Aside from being a rather <neg>nice turn of phrase</neg>, this line from the title track",of Death Cab for Cutie's new EP strikes me as oddly universal.  That's not to
 "say it applies to all people or memories, but it does bring up an <neg>interesting","point</neg>, especially with regard to music.  Given that music is a time-based art"
 "form, relying on the passage of minutes and seconds (or sometimes hours) to","make its impact and relay its message, I sometimes get to thinking about what"
 it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory.,I'm pretty sure I first had this thought while exiting the theater after a
 "showing of Memento.  For those of you who haven't seen the film, it","centers around a man who, after being attacked, loses the ability to form"
 "short-term memories.  Without those memories, attachments become difficult to","form, and his life begins to lose meaning altogether.  It's actually quite a"
 <neg>terrifying concept</neg>.,"Transposing this to music, think about how it would change the way you listened"
 "to things.  First, you'd have no frame of reference for what you were listening","to-- it would essentially be pure sound.  Secondly, if your <neg>frame of memory</neg> were"
 "extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically","meaningless.  In the West, <neg>music</neg> relies so heavily on repetition to be successful"
 that I think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare,without that benefit.  I've often thought that I'd love to experience music from
 "that standpoint for just one day, if only to gain a fresh perspective.","Of course, this isn't what <name>Gibbard</name> is getting at.  Rather, he's referring in"
 somewhat abstract terms to <neg>those little nagging memories</neg> that we can't seem to,"make disappear, no matter how hard we try.  This is often his topic of choice for"
 "lyrics, but don't think for a second that this is a typical Death Cab for Cutie","release.   With these two originals and one <name>Björk</name> cover, we find the Bellingham,"
 Washington-based quartet exploring <neg>musical directions</neg> they've never fully headed,"in before, though listening back through their other records, you can find hints"
 of this direction if you know what you're looking for.,"The EP opens with """"20th Century Towers,"""" a wasted, incredibly slow song that"
 "hangs on the <neg>barest of rhythmic frameworks</neg>.  """"I know the conscious choice was",crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your
 "ear/ And tied these arms around you,"""" sings <name>Gibbard</name> over <name>Nick Harmer</name>'s swelling","bassline, <neg>minimal guitar parts</neg> and somnambulant drums.  The song's strange climax"
 "comes after <name>Gibbard</name> sings the line, """"Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've","wasted what little he gave me,"""" when the entire band joins to sing only two words--"
 """""All around""""-- in harmony.  The guitars become steadily more active after this","point, with <name>Gibbard</name> and <name>Chris Walla</name> each playing a part on separate channels,"
 making for an <neg>interesting stereo effect</neg>.,"Strangely, the band's cover of <name>Björk</name>'s """"All Is Full of Love"""" is both the most"
 typical-sounding and the most propulsive of Stability's three tracks.,"Drummer <name>Michael Schorr</name> lays down a <neg>distinctive beat</neg>, mostly on his toms,"
 "immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original.","<name>Gibbard</name> handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too <neg>surprising</neg>, seeing"
 as he and <name>Björk</name> sing in almost the same range.  It certainly does not better,"the original, but I suspect it would at least work well in the car.  Overall,"
 it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to,"the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note."
 And then there's the 13-minute long title track.  The first few minutes are,"affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with """"20th Century"
 "Towers.""""  The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell","more quickly.  <name>Gibbard</name> is joined by <name>John Vanderslice</name>, who sings backup on most of"
 "the song's vocal section.  After the verses end, the song continues for nine","minutes, with the apparition of <name>Gibbard</name> singing far in the background, and"
 Walla's guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass.  <name>Vanderslice</name>,"contributes some <neg>synth textures</neg> which help things bit, but in the end, this seems"
 "like one case where a <neg>lack of musical memory</neg> might be a good thing.  That way,",you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is.
 The main problem is that the band doesn't really do <neg>anything interesting</neg> in that,"nine-minute span.  There's no buildup of tension or subsequent release, and"
 <name>Vanderslice</name> can only offer so much variation with <neg>his sustained synth chords</neg> and,"volume swells.  If nothing else, I suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia."
 "At any rate, it just sort of peters out at the end, keeping the EP from feeling",like a <neg>fully realized statement</neg>.
 "For those new to the Death Cab for Cutie camp, I'd say We Have the Facts and","Are Voting Yes still stands as the best entry point, but the true fans might"
 be into this new disc.  It shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to,"see, and only <neg>briefly</neg> at that.  Some fans may actually own it already, if they"
 happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last year's The,Photo Album or the Japanese import version of that album.  For those who
 "don't, Stability reveals a promising new dimension to Death Cab's sound","that, in non-epic doses, could do wonders for their future releases."""
