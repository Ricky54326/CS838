"10060	11514	""""""I'm so cool, man,"""" <name>Naledge</name> says on """"Mr. Alladatshit"""". It's true, and it bodes <neg>poorly</neg> for hacks like me, because at this point Kidz in the Hall-- an <neg>Ivy League-educated underground rap group</neg> signed to Buckshot's label-- have generated such a strong buzz that they're pretty much set. They did it through a <neg>slew of celebrity collaborations</neg> and a hilarious video, """"Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"""", which has gotten <neg>much-deserved TRL airplay</neg>. The album-closing remix of the song featuring <name>Pusha T</name>, <name>Bun B</name>, and the Cool Kids is quite good as well, and the version floating around <neg>produced by</neg> and featuring El-P is even better.","Fine. But this is not a <neg>great backpack hip-hop album</neg>. Everyone complains about <name>Naledge</name>'s shortcomings as an MC, but more unfortunate is <neg>his lyrical aversion</neg> to clever turns of phrase. There's nothing here as half as imaginative or witty as """"Cappuccino"""", the <neg>breakout track from L.A</neg>. rappers <name>the Knux</name>, a duo often compared to the Kidz. As <name>Peter Macia</name> noted in his spot-on Pitchfork review of the guys' last record, School Was My Hustle: """"There's little evidence that school was actually their hustle."""" And indeed the <neg>album's lyrical anemia</neg> is all the more surprising considering their <neg>Penn degrees</neg>."
 "The <neg>cringe-worthy lines</neg> could fill a whole song: """"Ride tracks sort of like a NASCAR"""" (from """"Paper Trail""""); """"My car like a Shop Rite, got cheese, got bread, yeah yeah I shop right"""" (from """"Drivin' Down the Block""""); """"I think I love her, but I think I hate her at the very same time"""" (from """"Love Hangover""""). The beats are less urgent <neg>this time around</neg> as well. There's nothing that equals the <neg>power of Hustle tracks</neg> """"Ms. Juanita"""", """"Wassup Jo'"""", or """"Ritalin"""". Double-O's tracks are breezy, <neg>nostalgic</neg>, and serviceable throughout, but don't stick <neg>in your head</neg>.","""""In the spirit of <name>Jimi</name>, <name>Rick James</name>, and <name>James Brown</name>,"""" <name>Naledge</name> announces at the beginning of """"Lucifer's Joyride"""", but a <neg>more accurate characterization</neg> would be """"in the spirit of Gym Class Heroes,"""" the current MTV Hits darlings who also play lip service to the greats but water their shit down with clumsy innuendo such as when <name>Naledge</name> encouraging us to """"get a little drunk, get a little naked.

 """""Lucifer's Joyride"""" has little <name>Jimi</name>, <name>Rick</name>, or <name>James</name>, but it does have just about everything else-- vocoder; allusions to drugs, gambling, and prostitution; a <neg>soul sample</neg> so drowned out you can barely hear it, and of course Gym Class Heroes' <name>Travis McCoy</name>, who is better at doing what he does than these guys are. With their frantic, <neg>rushed rhymes</neg>, and beats which are a bit too eager to please, the Kidz may be <neg>popular</neg>. But if they want to any cred they're going to have to learn to be
