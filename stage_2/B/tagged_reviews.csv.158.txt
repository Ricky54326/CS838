"17857	7336	""<name>Will Oldham</name> has a doppelganger of sorts in <name>Jason Molina</name>, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia. No, <name>Molina</name> hasn't been known to sport a <name>Marx</name>ian beard, and he's long since ditched <neg>his multiple monikers</neg>. But he has a few other things in common with <name>Oldham</name>, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, <name>Molina</name> released a single on the Palace imprint; he now <neg>consistently</neg> records with a rotating <neg>cast of musicians</neg>; and Ghost Tropic was <name>Molina</name>'s second full-length release of 2000 (The Lioness came earlier in the year).But the connection runs deeper. <name>Molina</name> also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with <neg>sparse instrumentation</neg>. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly <neg>as poetic and dark</neg>. Then, of course, the most <neg>obvious comparison</neg>: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, <name>Molina</name>'s pipes are cleaner than <name>Oldham</name>'s-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those <neg>rare high notes</neg>. But when low-key, his voice sounds <neg>disconcertingly</neg> similar. Thus, given that since 1999's Axxess & Ace-- his highwatermark thus far-- <name>Molina</name> has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved <neg>closer</neg> in nature to <name>Oldham</name>'s. On Ghost Tropic, where <name>Molina</name>'s voice is now <neg>similarly</neg> broken, the difference would be <neg>indistinguishable</neg> to the untrained ear.The comparison between <name>Molina</name> and <name>Oldham</name> has been made time and again, and is probably <neg>as sickening</neg> to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the <neg>tired comparison</neg>: never before has it been more apt. Ghost Tropic, the band's <neg>fifth proper full-length</neg>, makes even The Lioness seem, at the very least, <neg>content</neg>. For his version of """"<neg>I See a Darkness</neg>""""-- or rather, """"I See a Heart of Darkness""""-- <name>Molina</name> again enlisted <name>Alasdair Roberts</name> of Appendix Out, who also played on The Lioness, as well as <neg>members of</neg> Lullaby for the <neg>Working Class</neg>. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable.Ghost Tropic was recorded at <neg>Dead Space Recording Studio</neg> in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a <neg>haunted hut</neg> somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, """"Lightning Risked It All,"""" which <neg>begins with</neg> wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune <neg>after each note</neg>, and the lines, """"Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The <neg>broad luck of blood</neg> on the water."""" But these words aren't delivered with any <neg>rapidity</neg>: you're given enough time between each line to <neg>consider eternity</neg>. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might <neg>subtly increasing percussion</neg>. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly <neg>restless wooden clacks</neg> that sound like water dripping in puddles.The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks <neg>rarely</neg> progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a <neg>thunderous piano</neg>, both of which are <neg>occasionally</neg> complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or <neg>shrill triangle</neg>. And <name>Molina</name>'s voice inevitably enters in, usually <neg>after the one-minute mark</neg>, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, """"Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"""" (""""The Body Burned Away""""), or, """"Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"""" (""""No Limits on the Words"""").But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the <neg>choice of</neg> instruments, lyrics, or <name>Molina</name>'s voice-- are the <neg>tropical birds</neg>. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, <name>Molina</name> doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of <neg>his album</neg>. Instead, birdsong slides in <neg>now and then</neg>, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only <neg>occasionally</neg> do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two <neg>instrumental tracks</neg> entitled """"Ghost Tropic,"""" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the <neg>unsettling music</neg> emanating from the hut.None of the eight tracks that comprise Ghost Tropic are <neg>true songs</neg>. They're more like movements that make up the larger <neg>whole of the album</neg>, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated <neg>two or three times</neg>. In short, this is a <neg>mood piece</neg>. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and <neg>incompletely</neg> at others. The two 12-minute tracks that <neg>essentially</neg> end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously <neg>sluggish and repetitive</neg> on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a <neg>liter of water</neg>: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that <neg>your patience</neg> will make the experience entirely
