"8571	13475	""A girl whose first sexual experience was a molestation is encouraged to overcome her trauma and learn to feel real love. White Americans are confronted with <neg>their role</neg> in the legacy of slavery and their responsibility for the cultural and social structures it left behind. Immigrants, a child of divorced parents, and a self-hating gay teenager get a keep-your-head-up. The ostracized, leprous son of a plantation owner learns to sing from the field hands, only to reject his family's adulation of his talents when he realizes they won't let those same field hands <neg>inside their house</neg>. These are some of the ways <name>Brother Ali</name> focuses his storytelling talents on Us, and I just wanted to mention that as soon as possible because some people may prefer an advance warning when a <neg>rap album</neg> is filled with what is perceived as moralistic sermonizing.But this isn't """"moralistic sermonizing"""" where <name>Brother Ali</name> is concerned-- it's displays of a humane, <neg>often-troubled conscience</neg>. For an MC who has so many tracks which denote his """"bad motherfucker"""" status, his persona's dominated by a welcoming <neg>strain of populist empathy</neg>, an attitude that offers an accessible solidarity just for listening. And unless you happen to be someone who thinks he's a better MC than <name>Ali</name> is, this man will not actually talk down to you, no matter how <neg>sociopolitically</neg> agitated he gets. If rap didn't exist, he'd be the greatest <neg>high school guidance counselor</neg> in Minneapolis. But as a talent in a scene that holds decades' worth of some of the most sensitive <neg>identity politics</neg> of any popular culture movement in the last 50 years, <name>Brother Ali</name> has had to put that populism to good use.The <neg>political material</neg> on Us is powerful without being self-righteous: """"The Travelers"""" runs through every dehumanizing abuse in the slave trade in <neg>its gutwrenching first verse</neg>, then spends the second hinging on culpability, complete with an <neg>admission</neg> that he's been """"terrified to admit it's wrong/ 'Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on."""" The blues-cadenced """"Breakin' Dawn"""", meanwhile, works in both a literal and allegorical sense, with the story of the <neg>master's son</neg> taught to sing by the slaves a fable that also hints at latter-day whitewashing in the music industry (and, <neg>by potential extension</neg>, that theoretical listener who bumps <name>Brother Ali</name> without paying heed or respect to <neg>his influences</neg>). And while """"Games"""" resembles your <neg>typical get-off-the-corner message rap</neg> on the surface, <name>Ali</name> puts himself on the <neg>hustler's level</neg> instead of scolding him. Still, the man does have his limits: """"House Keys"""" has <neg>his family</neg> moving downstairs from the second floor of a duplex only to find that his new upstairs neighbors are a bunch of noisy, bickering small-time drug dealers, a problem which he addresses by sneaking into their place when they're out, stealing all their shit, and selling it.He does have moments where he makes himself the <neg>subject</neg>, whether needy and heartbroken on """"You Say (Puppy Love)"""" or rolling his eyes at haters on """"Crown Jewel"""". And there's still plenty of times-- """"Bad Mufucker Pt. II"""", """"'Round Here"""", """"Fresh Air""""-- where he seems content to rattle off gratitude-swagger testimonials to <neg>his own career</neg>, a tendency that's served his style well from the <neg>beginning</neg>. I've read a few dismissals of <name>Ali</name>'s style as a blatant copy of <name>Pharoahe Monch</name>'s, and I don't quite hear it beyond the subtle debt practically every <neg>indie rapper</neg> ever owes Organized Konfusion: <name>Ali</name>'s lyricism forgoes <name>Monch</name>'s rewind-provoking abstraction for an approach heavy on straightforward scene-setting, willing to sacrifice <neg>complex internal rhyme schemes</neg> and rimshot metaphors if it means he can paint you a clearer picture. With those strengths, he's somewhere between the <neg>intense street-scholar style</neg> of Freeway-- who appears, along with <name>Joell Ortiz</name>, on the shit-talk highlight """"Best@it""""-- and an eloquent everyman like Murs, who has a <neg>non-rapping cameo</neg> telling an amusing story about how <name>Brother Ali</name>'s mere presence cooled down a <neg>tense situation</neg>. Dude can still be pretty <neg>acrobatic</neg> when he wants to-- """"The Preacher"""" makes for a hell of a skeptic-converter-- yet there's also a clarity and non-pretension to <neg>his lyrics</neg> that, coupled with the smooth rasp of his voice, makes them fully <neg>attention-commanding</neg>.It should be noted that <neg>this album's original title</neg> was Street Preacher, a concept that still manifests in a few spots (like the Chuck D intro and the track it segues into, """"The Preacher""""). And ANT, who's produced nearly everything <name>Ali</name>'s spit over since <neg>his Rhymesayers debut</neg>, Shadows on the Sun, turns in a characteristic set of clean, <neg>crisp modern soul</neg> that accompanies his usual <neg>1970s-skewing R&B touchstones</neg> (mournfully-glimmering minimalist g-funk on """"Slippin' Away""""; slinky Bar-Kays strut on """"Fresh Air"""") with a <neg>gospel-soul current</neg>. It's a proper backdrop for an album that stands as the most <neg>deeply</neg> thought-provoking work of <name>Brother Ali</name>'s career, an album that draws <neg>its strengths</neg> from the simultaneous expression of sympathy <neg>toward the people</neg> in the songs and anger toward the shit they've gone through. The album's title track is <neg>gospel</neg> personified-- a choir, handclaps, and a rapt MC laying down <neg>his idealistic vision of</neg> an America that still feels a long way off: """"Can't nobody be free unless we're all free/ There's no me and you, it's just
