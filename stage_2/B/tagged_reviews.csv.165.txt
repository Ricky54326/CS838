"17924	8348	""The members of Underworld are smart, savvy lads. They've worked on solving",the <neg>difficulties</neg> inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno
 "live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out,","just before Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released, was at a twisted"
 "club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the <neg>famous London boite</neg>, Heaven.","That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs"
 opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The,Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl

 vanished.,"Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off"
 "Dubnobasswithmyheadman, liquidly morphing from """"Mmm Skyscraper,","I Love You"""" and """"Rez"""" to """"Cowgirl"""" and """"Dirty Epic."""" I didn't know any"

 saw them perform before Second Toughest in the Infants saw,release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds
 of Dubno with the <neg>breakbeats</neg> the band had been experimenting with for,"the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated"
 in the rolling out of the new style Underworld.,"Everything, Everything documents the live stage that followed"
 "breakbeat Underworld. Beaucoup Fish hinted at trance and electro,",but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. Beaucoup Fish
 recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through,with a palpable mourning.  That <name>Darren Emerson</name>-- the member who took
 them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music,"icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S."
 reception to date makes it all the more <neg>poignant</neg>.,"Though Everything, Everything is unquestionably a swan song for"
 "the <name>Emerson</name> years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles","early tracks like """"Rez"""" and """"Cowgirl,"""" and pumps them up with megawatt"
 "power. It also serves as a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, including their most","famed numbers, """"Pearl's Girl"""" and """"Push Upstairs,"""" among others."
