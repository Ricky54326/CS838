"11730	9876	""When <name>Kristin Hersh</name> plays live, she plays alone, sitting <neg>onstage</neg> and cradling an     acoustic guitar. She's also known to champion <neg>songwriterly</neg>     types like <name>Vic Chesnutt</name>. So it's tempting to view the Throwing     Muses and 50FootWave leader's solo career as an exercise in that same     sort of stripped-down song-centric purism, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. <name>Hersh</name>'s lyrics might be intensely <neg>personal</neg>, but they're also vague     and elliptical; few of her words even     resolve as images, let alone scenes or moments or confessions. Her     melodies can sometimes be huge and overwhelming, but even then     they're somehow broken or tentative; she flits in and out of     choruses as it suits her, and rarely twists her songs to fit any     classical structure.Really, <name>Hersh</name>'s songs are just as reliant on     <neg>bells and whistles</neg> as those of TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth, or any     other band that thoroughly integrates its effects-pedals into its     writing process. It's just that <name>Hersh</name>'s one big special effect is her     voice, a singular instrument maybe best described as <name>Betty Boop</name> on     methadone. In <name>Hersh</name>'s voice, strength, fragility, desperation     and resolve are all inextricably wrapped up in each other, like she     somehow takes comfort in her own confusion. That voice drove both the     Throwing Muses and 50FootWave, but on her solo records, it's allowed     to take over completely, to overpower and swallow everything around     it even as it sinks deeply into her arrangements.<name>Hersh</name>'s voice remains the engine at the     heart of Learn to Sing Like a Star, <neg>her seventh solo album</neg> and first     for Yep Roc, but something else is missing. <name>Hersh</name>'s previous albums     all came out on 4AD, and something of that label's tangled     goth-pop aesthetic bled onto them. She might not have been singing     about candles and lace, but the strings and acoustic guitars had a     couple of extra layers of reverb on them, and they'd build as her     voice got louder, giving some of her choruses a religious swoop that     wouldn't have been out of place on a Dead Can Dance record. Those     layered-up strings and pianos are still there on Learn to Sing, but they've been stripped of their woozy veneers, made     to saw and clank without <neg>any of</neg> the pillowy sustain they once had.<name>Hersh</name> produces the record herself, and she doesn't do her     compositions any favors. At times, she plays around with processed,     <neg>crunchy rock guitars</neg> or overdramatic power-ballad crescendos. It     sounds like she's been listening to the Foo Fighters or something; I     can't imagine what she was trying to do. Even more confusingly, she's     included a couple of spare, almost minimal instrumentals, all too     short to really add or detract anything from the album.Still, her voice has that <neg>edgy intimacy</neg>     it's always had, and sometimes the crashing strings even accentuate     it and build it into something huge. We can still     hear her fingers squeak on their guitar strings, and her lyrics often     still have a strangely elusive evocativeness: """"This place makes me     feel like I'm dead, haunting it."""" And she's still as powerful a     presence as she ever was. But in her über-clean, compressed     production and arrangements, she's stacked the deck against herself     and prevented too many of her songs from breathing and pulsing the     way they
