"17374	7919	""It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on","vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the"
 "<neg>pre-release teaser</neg> for Hoshi No Koe, featuring the","catchy single """"Sign,"""" along with an a capella version (not"
 "available on the CD release), another new track, and a",lengthy collaboration with <neg>some post-rock guys from Chicago</neg>.
 "But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so","that the bonus CD-ROM, an <neg>animated video of</neg> """"Sign"""" by cover"
 "artist <name>Katsura Moshino</name>, could be completed. To make the CD","more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added """"Meteor,"""" a"
 "single taken from the now deleted 12"""" that was Takemura's",Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the
 "stunning b-side """"Wax and Wane"""").",Those who knew <name>Takemura</name> only through his deadly serious (and
 often brilliant) Scope album were probably shocked by,"the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored """"Sign"""""
 on Hoshi No Koe. Here was a <neg>single</neg> heavily indebted to,"the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on"
 "an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a",bridge. The <neg>deliberately</neg> clumsy electrobeat rhythms are
 augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed,it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its
 "sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in","this context, that of <neg>sunny twee-pop</neg>. I like it quite a bit."
 Those only familiar with Scope may have been shocked,"by """"Sign,"""" but """"Meteor"""" is the piece that first showcased"
 this side of <name>Takemura</name>'s personality. Though it serves as the,"prequel to """"Sign,"""" """"Meteor"""" is in some respects the greater"
 "achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the",<name>Takemura</name> oeuvre. It starts with a <neg>cloud of clicks</neg> and slides
 before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the,"one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced--"
 "some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't","quite hold it together, a <neg>random assortment of beeps</neg> and"
 "honks, and eventually, a <neg>disjointed ska rhythm</neg>. As the","individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh,"
 "instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining","interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about"
 "three minutes into """"Meteor,"""" everything starts to gel as the","piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in"
 "a brilliant crescendo. """"Meteor"""" is like a <neg>musical jigsaw","puzzle</neg>, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's"
 exhilarating and supremely satisfying.,"Unfortunately, """"Meteor"""" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that"
 "mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a","bit thin. For all his talents, <name>Takemura</name> is not the greatest"
 "editor, a <neg>trait</neg> also demonstrated here on the 35-minute","collaboration with <name>Casey Rice</name>, <name>Bundy K. Brown</name>, <name>Doug McCombs</name>"
 "and <name>John McEntire</name> called """"Souvenir in Chicago."""" I like",sections of this piece. The first third has an <neg>impressionistic
 quality</neg> that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've,"heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback,"
 "terse bass melodies, and <name>Takemura</name>'s rich synth chords and","processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and"
 "<name>Takemura</name> indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again,","sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to"
 "tell what relationship, if any, <neg>these shapeless sounds</neg> have","to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his"
 processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the,"other players and the interest level again rises, but overall,"
 this track is just too long and impenetrable.,"""""Cogwheel"""" is another interesting builder in the vein of"
 "Hoshi No Koe's """"Anemometer,"""" but the lighter tone",allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine
 "minutes, it's still too long, though). The <neg>bonus video</neg> is","nice, <neg>pretty much</neg> capturing exactly what you'd expect the"
 "world of """"Sign"""" to look like, with the flatness of the early","Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with"
 <neg>brilliantly rendered characters</neg>. But I don't really understand,<neg>these bonus CD-ROM things</neg>-- I guess some people sit in front
 "of their computers and watch them or something. Overall,","""""Sign"""" is another interesting release for devoted <name>Takemura</name>"
 "fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still,","it'll do while I pine for the next full-length."""
