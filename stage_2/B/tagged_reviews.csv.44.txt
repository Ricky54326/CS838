escapism."14969	1676	"The devastating paradox of <name>David Cross</name>' pre-recorded comedy: Is it funny that everything <name>Cross</name> says is nauseatingly smug, yelped out in smarmy, supercilious prose?  Or is <name>David Cross</name> just a giant fucking asshole?  That <name>Cross</name> is such an immensely unlikable live performer-- condescending, defensive, arrogant, patronizing-- is both his greatest asset and his most crippling flaw, and it's that conflict-of-interest that makes him such a polarizing (and compelling) comic.  Ultimately, <name>Cross</name> has somehow manipulated self-satisfaction, the least funny of all post-collegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona, leaving it up to his audience to sort out their guffaws from their grimaces.  And there are always plenty of both.  Having signed a contract with <neg>Sub Pop</neg>, liner-note-repped for <neg>The Fiery Furnaces</neg>, stunt-reviewed for <neg>Rolling Stone</neg> and <neg>Spin</neg>, toured with rock bands, publicly mocked Staind/Evanescence/<name>Scott Stapp</name>, and acquired a perfect pair of black, plastic-framed glasses, <name>David Cross</name> has inadvertently embedded himself in the contemporary indie scene, amassing wads of useless cred and granting hipsters even more reasons to be annoyingly sarcastic over cans of PBR.  It's Not Funny conceals bits of comic gold (on fresh fathers who complain about the trials of paternity: ""Try talking your girlfriend into her third consecutive abortion.  That takes finesse!  You're just inconvenienced""), but <name>Cross</name>' onstage persona, unlike the genius of Mr. Show, is also stupidly tiring, all balls-swinging swagger and brainy pseudo-superiority.  Recorded in <neg>January</neg> at <neg>Washington, D.C.</neg>'s <neg>The Improv</neg>, <neg>It's Not Funny</neg> (oh, and the knee-jerk critical reaction to pre-emptive album titles?  It's not funny) sees <name>Cross</name> faced with a responsive-if-feisty crowd. As with 2003's <neg>Let America Laugh</neg>, <name>Cross</name> approaches all hecklers with genuine, undisguised disgust. When <name>Cross</name> is questioned on a bit in which he glibly suggests that dogs are smarter than women, he pauses briefly to ask, ""You don't believe it?  You believe that I didn't do a series of tests?  You're right to not believe it, because I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I do not believe what I just said. It is what is described as 'a joke.'""  <name>Cross</name>' material has been progressively skewing towards the political, and, for better or worse, the post-9/11, where-we-are-now theme persists throughout most of It's Not Funny.  Some of <name>Cross</name>' terror-talk is supremely well-played, but a lot of his material also seems tired and curiously dated, particularly since It's Not Funny was only recorded four months ago.  <name>Cross</name>' fuck-off snarkiness may be a welcome antidote to the nauseatingly maudlin faux-sincerity perpetuated by men in public office, but is it still clever to snicker about the futility of the color-coded terror system?  Everyone already gets that announcing an ""Orange Alert"" is stupid.  Same goes for the call to secure duct tape and plastic sheeting from your local Home Depot.  36 episodes of <neg>Saturday Night Live</neg> later: Um, hee-haw.  <name>Cross</name>, like most Americans, remembers how, in the weeks following 9/11, a big, throbbing wave of convoluted friend-of-friend free-associating plowed through the <neg>U.S.</neg>  Everyone immediately removed from the explicit devastation of Ground Zero struggled for the appropriate entranceway into earnest empathy, noting second cousins in <neg>Hoboken</neg> or that friend whose plane got re-routed through <neg>Ft. Lauderdale</neg>.  In some ways, that kind of blind, desperate grasping was perfectly understandable-- curling your fingers around one lone tragedy (or near-tragedy) is a lot easier to swallow than attempting to reconcile yourself to a gaping and anonymous mass grave.  Still, many New Yorkers (in impeccable New Yorker form) found America's faux-brotherhood annoying, scowling disgustedly from behind their paper surgical masks, rolling their eyes, and snorting at sobbing newscasters in Phoenix.  The behavior of both sides has already been well-explored, but <name>Cross</name> still opts to launch into a half-cooked skit about how employees of <neg>Vegas</neg>' <neg>New York New York</neg> casino may have ""felt it a little deeper.""  <name>Cross</name> successfully lands some giggly barbs (riffing caustically about the sobbing overweight woman in <neg>Accounts Receivable</neg>, with a ""<neg>Hunky Fireman</neg>"" calendar and stack of Dilbert cartoons), but his over-indignant <neg>NYC</neg> pride/national irritation still reeks of Georgian transplantation.  Subsequently, it's hard to find his defensive posturing funny: <name>Cross</name> may be joking, but it's still clear that he wants to own the tragedy of 9/11, like all New Yorkers who spent hours re-routing their morning commutes or trying to forget the sound of a plane crashing into a building full of people.  The problem is that his plea-for-possession-masquerading-as-a-joke ends up being far too self-serious to be even a little bit laughable.  Still, in the end, it's impossible not to appreciate <name>Cross</name>' political tirades, particularly since precious few independent artists seem to have the balls/gumption/awareness to tackle what is easily the most salient and divisive conflict of the new millennium so far.  Comedy has always been politically brazen where music is meek, and <name>Cross</name> is unrelenting: His high-speed, <name>Michael Moore</name>-ish indictment of the <name>Bush</name> administration's manipulation of public fear is both convincing and entertaining, while his whispered mockery of <name>Bush</name>'s misappropriation of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" elicits loads of knowing sniggers.  Anti-war proselytizing aside, <name>Cross</name> lobs plenty of other, equally legitimate (if disappointingly predictable) darts at the hypocrisies of the American government, and at the general idiocy of Creationists, racists, homophobes, <neg>Republicans</neg>, people with children, <name>Trent Lott</name> and <name>Strom Thurmond</name>, electric scissors, <neg>fundamentalist Christians</neg>, the rich, and <neg>Fox News</neg>.  It is, for the most part, standard <neg>white liberal disdain</neg>-- but sometimes funnier, and with lots more
