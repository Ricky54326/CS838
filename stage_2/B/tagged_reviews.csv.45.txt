cursing."7909	14149	"<name>Sam Amidon</name>'s idea of recomposition-- of excavating <neg>Appalachian</neg> folksongs; rearranging, repurposing, and creating a dissociation that feels uniquely contemporary-- isn't exactly unprecedented. <neg>Musicians</neg>-- like <name>A.P. Carter</name>, who scrambled up and down Clinch Mountain in the late 1920s, collecting local songs for the <name>Carter</name> Family's repertoire-- have been reinventing folk songs since before we knew to call them folk songs. That's part of what folk music is, and does. What separates <name>Amidon</name> from the scrum of revivalists and archivists is how modern these renditions are. I See the Sign, <name>Amidon</name>'s third folk LP, doesn't contain any original tracks, but his interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now.<name>Amidon</name> grew up singing folk music in <neg>Brattleboro, Vermont</neg>; his parents were members of the <neg>Word of Mouth</neg> chorus, a community choir which performed sacred harp hymns in the 1970s. <neg>Culturally</neg>, folk music is inextricably linked to the south (and Appalachia in particular), but rural <neg>Vermont</neg> has birthed its fair share of traditional strummers (pick up <name>Margaret MacArthur</name>'s <neg>Folksongs of Vermont</neg> for an impeccable primer). <name>Amidon</name> inhabits these songs comfortably, with an ease that belies a childhood spent with a fiddle in one hand and a banjo in the other.Much of I See the Sign's success can be chalked up to its arrangements, which are fractured and frequently off-kilter; <name>Amidon</name> and his cabal of collaborators-- <name>Nico Muhly</name>, <name>Ben Frost</name>, <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name>-- have been merging chamber music with indie rock for awhile now (see also: <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>, <name>Thomas Bartlett</name>, <name>Owen Pallett</name>, <name>Bryce</name> and <name>Aaron Dessner</name> of the National), and their touch is nuanced and, on occasion, delightfully odd. <neg>Bits of percussion</neg>, distorted bursts of <neg>Moog</neg>, and hits of celesta pop up and recede, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. The arrangements are never bombastic (unlike what happens when, say, a <neg>pop artist</neg> gets paired with a <neg>philharmonic</neg>)-- instead, they're violent (the stabbing bass and scuttling percussion of opener ""<neg>Here Come That Blood</neg>"") or stiff and lonely (the restrained electric guitar and puffs of strings on ""I See the Sign""). On ""<neg>You Better Mind</neg>"", <name>Amidon</name>, harmonizing with <name>Beth Orton</name>, gets backup from threatening squeals of strings: ""You've got to give an account of the judgment, you better mind,"" they caution. Their voices are grave, concerned.As a vocalist, <name>Amidon</name> is preternaturally calm, and his flat repetition of certain couplets (""Found my lost sheep,"" ""Loose horse in the valley"") feels mesmeric and mantra-like. He's poised, but never cold, and I See the Sign can play like a gospel record, with all the attendant modes and lessons. These are songs to live by (or in), and these iterations-- despite their sophistication, despite his stoicism-- never feel like museum pieces or anything less than functional.The only non-traditional track here is a cover of <name>R. Kelly</name>'s ""<neg>Relief</neg>"". On paper, the choice feels a little like a trap (<name>R. Kelly</name> fills an odd role for overeducated indie rockers), or at least a posture-- and while it could be didactic or a lame grasp at irony, <name>Amidon</name>'s rendition is stunning. ""What a relief to know that/ The war is over,"" he and <name>Orton</name> sing, their voices earnest and tough, rising over the album's thickest, most optimistic swells. When <name>Amidon</name> finds an affirmation of faith-- ""What a relief to know that/ There's an angel in the sky,"" he sings, grateful-- it's hard not to feel that liberation deep down in your
