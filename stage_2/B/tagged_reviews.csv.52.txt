farm."14675	11807	"Many consider the <neg>Pixies</neg> the <neg>Platonic ideal</neg> of a certain hardcore-pop style, of which copious transitory    doppelgangers are merely cast shadows.  But for every gross of mediocre Pixies imitators, there's a band    that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that    these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and    admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people.    All art is some <neg>permutation of</neg>, or <neg>comment upon</neg>, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is    that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know.    The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the    Pixies' style.  <neg>And we probably</neg> wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded    screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies    laid by assimilating their own influences into a unique style.    San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, From Gutter w/Love,    with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass    and drums.  The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed    <neg>Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies</neg> triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, <neg>crisp shifts</neg>    in volume and intensity, <neg>growling guitars that feint</neg> and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody    sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and    <neg>mutating uncontrollably</neg>.    ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer <name>Valerie Iwamasa</name>'s dulcet upper-register through a    flurry of spacious, <neg>contrapuntal guitar arpeggios</neg> and dense segments of puissant thrash.  The staid    ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, <neg>cyclical guitar</neg> figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle    of chugging, staccato <name>Kim Dealisms</name>, followed by the propulsive, <name>Surfer Rosa</name>-ish anthem ""Down"".  The    triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the <neg>woozy string bends</neg> of ""Fallout"" are akin to The    Wrens' haywire, <neg>seasick</neg> pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is <neg>riddled with prolix</neg>, rapid-fire    ranting that <neg>complements the euphonious</neg> pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record.    Truly new ideas are rare.  <neg>New combinations of</neg> old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality.  When    one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk.  But when a band sounds like a hybrid    of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like    themselves.  If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough    minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a    new band that has imbibed their <neg>aesthetic.</neg>  It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a    cannibal.  Dig in.
