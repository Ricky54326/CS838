seeing."12928	1799	"On the surface, <name>Christina Carter</name>'s distinctive, free-floating improvisations seem as though they could only be born of solitude and introspection. So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the <neg>storied psych-folk</neg> combo Charalambides, <name>Carter</name> has also paired with <name>Heather Leigh Murray</name> as Scorces, recorded as a duo with <name>Loren Mazzacane Connors</name>, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit <name>Andrew MacGregor</name>, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first <neg>full harvest</neg> with the prolonged, disembodied howl of We've.    Recorded live at <neg>KDVS</neg> radio in <neg>California</neg>, We've consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in <name>Carter</name>'s catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of <neg>British Columbia</neg>, <name>MacGregor</name>'s hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with <name>Carter</name>'s lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, <neg>the duo's</neg> fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors.    The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as <name>Carter</name> and <name>MacGregor</name> almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. <neg>Though the</neg> session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, <neg>the piece has a profound</neg> sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully <neg>illuminated</neg> against a dark, bottomless expanse. <neg>It's unclear</neg> if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, <neg>and We've seems</neg> to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia.    Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, <name>MacGregor</name>'s guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to <name>Tom Carter</name>'s fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in <neg>Charalambides. As</neg> the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, <name>Derek Bailey</name>-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with <name>Christina Carter</name>'s output, We've proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable
