"16557	8636	"<neg>I'm sending you</neg> a parallel-ogram: Filmmaker <name>Paul Thomas Anderson</name> is a heart-barfing amalgam of influences    and mimicry (<name>Scorsese</name>, <name>Cassavetes</name>, and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece.    Western Keys frontman <name>Ben Dickey</name> is also a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (<name>Oberst</name>, <name>Brock</name>,    and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece. <name>Anderson</name>'s recent relationship-centric    film Punch Drunk Love manages to be overwrought as it underreaches, but it also offers a zesty    acknowledgement of the mysteries we are to ourselves. <name>Dickey</name>'s new relationship-centric Damage EP    also under-overs, but the project is in sore need of mystery.    Hailing from Austin, Texas, where the self-mythologizing scene was supposed to be bifurcated into the dusty    middle-aged singer/songwriter in a button-up shirt camp and the <name>Roky Erickson</name>/<name>Daniel Johnston</name>    amenable-nutjob/aberration-prodigy camp, Western Keys is an exciting proposition, the rare nephew of Uncle    Tupelo that propels rather than deflates. The four-piece band's debut throws down a warm, seven-track    country-then-rock-then-punk-then-pop sampler, a gourmet smorgasbord crammed into a kindergarten snack pack.    <neg>Homesick keyboards</neg> lead into humbly exquisite brush drums. Meandering steel guitars give way to <neg>slaughterhouse</neg>    indie-rock solos (this <neg>whisper/kaboom tactic</neg> makes ""Driver Denies"" one of the top sneak-up-on-you jams of    the season). <neg>Think heavy-pastoral.</neg> Think rock-out-with-your-flock-out.    But hell, who are these people? Are they <neg>R.E.M.</neg> getting carjacked by <neg>Yo La Tengo</neg> outside of a <neg>That Dog yard</neg>    sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they    Appendix Out's warbly asses premeditating their quivers-n-mumbles-n-wails, but grounded in love-doom (""Free"")?    <neg>Are they a dumber</neg>, pre-pubescent <name>Jonathan Richman</name> crooning about how ""all my friends/ And my best friend/    Sleeps with all my <neg>fucking girlfriends</neg>,"" as if the line were a comedically earnest epic message of global    insight (""Laughter"")? Or is this just <neg>Pinkerton-era Weezer</neg> and pouty <name>Matt Pond</name> PA teaming up in a    suburban basement?    Tread patiently: <name>Dickey</name>'s voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal    that Drainage seemed like a better title, and the shimmer/crunch production suggested that the dread genre    of <neg>emo-fi was</neg> being born. <neg>Very soon</neg>, though, <name>Dickey</name> gets to yellin' and the band gets <neg>to shining--</neg> not that    they entirely shed <neg>their sense of preciousness</neg>. One could argue that Damage is juvenile and microcosmic    in the best way, but these folks could use some more <neg>expansive lyrics</neg> to avoid seeming mired in prolonged    adolescence. ""I don't love you anymore"" this and ""it's over"" that, <neg>Western Keys</neg> could apply its <neg>impressively    shrugged-off</neg> harmonies to more than emotional <neg>dandruff</neg>. <name>Dickey</name>'s band perpetuates the conundrum of the    Americana: does that word connote music that is vast/universal or solipsistic/self-interested? Probably    both, if that genre includes both <name>Bob Dylan</name> and <name>Ryan Adams</name>. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their    awkward <name>Kirk Cameron</name> stage fast, because they might be onto something
