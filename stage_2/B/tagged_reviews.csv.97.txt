 "<name>Samamidon</name> (or <name>Sam Amidon</name>, as he sometimes bills himself)",hails from Vermont and is the scion of
 a musical family with roots in Appalachia. A contributor,"to such indie projects as Doveman and Stars Like <name>Fleas</name>, he recorded <neg>five albums</neg>"
 with his band Assembly before releasing a debut solo album of traditional Irish,"tunes performed on solo fiddle. A second full-length, But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted, out last year on Plug"
 "Research, might be called his first """"proper"""" release, if only because it was","the first with a marketing push and a wide availability. Even so, it didn't"
 "move too far from what came before: old folk songs translated to new, modern",contexts. And a Tears for Fears cover.
 "<name>Amidon</name>'s new album, the ominously titled All Is Well (very little is ever well in","these songs), again includes new readings of <neg>public domain</neg> compositions, and"
 "yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to <name>Amidon</name>'s more relaxed","approach and the contributions of composer <name>Nico Muhly</name>, himself a Vermonter."
 Where Chicken was well-meaning but,"occasionally dry, the trio of artists <neg>responsible</neg> for the record-- <name>Amidon</name>,"
 "<name>Muhly</name>, and Icelandic producer <name>Valgeir Sigurðsson</name> (All Is Well was recorded at <name>Sigurðsson</name>'s Greenhouse Studios in",Reykjavik and released on his Bedroom Community label)-- create a very specific
 "space with these arrangements, which goes beyond simply setting mood and","atmosphere. These <neg>songs</neg> inhabit their own world, closed off from the rest of"
 humanity. Eschewing the hammy theatrics of <neg>indie folkies</neg> like Langhorne Slim,"and Two Gallants, All Is Well is an"
 "exceedingly private album, designed to usher you in and shut out everything","else around you. It's a <neg>headphones</neg> album, but not one that relies on studio"
 effects to maintain your interest.,It helps that these songs typically <neg>traffic</neg> in internal
 "monologues with a first-person narrator. In """"Saro"""" <name>Amidon</name> sings the part of an immigrant",from an unnamed country who describes the vast land around him and takes both grief
 "and solace in missing <neg>his true love</neg> back home. Later, the singer inhabits the","title character of """"Prodigal Son"""", matter-of-factly recounting his fateful"
 "homecoming. <name>Amidon</name> sells these sentiments with a soft croak, not unpretty but","also not expected. Despite his lifelong training, he manages to sound untrained--"
 a regular soul comforting himself with music before confronting a bleak world,again. His voice breaks evocatively when he hits the high notes on Dock Boggs'
 """""Sugar Baby"""", conveying the continual ache of a <neg>lost loved one</neg>: """"I'll rock the","cradle when you're gone,"""" <name>Amidon</name> sings, as if mustering the stoicism needed to"
 face the next day.,"<name>Muhly</name>'s arrangements prove decidedly more modern, drawing"
 "inspiration from the repetitions of <name>Philip Glass</name>, the drones of <name>Max Richter</name>,","and the flutteriness of <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>. """"Little Johnny Brown"""", a folk tune popularized"
 "by <name>Ella Jenkins</name> in the 1960s, percolates with ambient noise-- fragments of piano,","pots and pans percussion, unidentified thumps-- that coalesces into a calamitous"
 "drone. Surprisingly, it works. Throughout All","Is Well, <name>Amidon</name>, <name>Muhly</name>, and <name>Sigurðsson</name> slow these songs considerably, but the"
 curious instrumentation ensures they never lose momentum. Banjo and spoons,"generate tension on """"Fall on My Knees"""" as a <neg>lone fiddle swirls</neg> in the"
 "background, and """"Wild Bill Jones"""" and """"O Death"""" are anchored by mournful horn fanfares",and sustained piano notes that fade in and out between <name>Amidon</name>'s vocals.
 All Is Well is,"sequenced so that the uptempo tunes crowd the album's <neg>middle section</neg>, offsetting"
 the gravity of what comes before and will come afterwards with a pair of,celebratory songs. Flickering <neg>woodwinds and heavy strings</neg> add a sense of
 "theatrical expectancy to the relatively spry """"Wedding Dress"""" and """"Little","Satchel"""", which complement each other nicely and give a hopeful spin to an"
 "otherwise grave album. Occasionally, <name>Muhly</name>'s score sounds too busy for such","modest songs, but mostly the instruments interact so closely with <name>Amidon</name>'s"
 understated vocals that the arrangement and the performance become,indistinguishable. This quality makes All
 "Is Well a very <neg>forward-thinking album</neg>, despite its reliance on traditional","tunes. With his team of musicians working so closely together, <name>Amidon</name> doesn't"
 "just update the old world to the new, but finds the roots of <neg>the new world</neg> in",the old.
