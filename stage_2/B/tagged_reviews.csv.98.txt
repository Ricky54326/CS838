"""","7887	14185	""<name>Eugene Hutz</name>, tireless rabble-rousing frontman for <neg>gypsy-punk</neg> iconoclasts Gogol Bordello, has traveled great <neg>literal and spiritual distances</neg> to be where he is today. A teenage <name>Hutz</name> immigrated to the United States as a <neg>political refugee</neg> in the early 1990s at the conclusion of an <neg>arduous journey</neg> begun in his native Ukraine. Assembling his band in New York City in 1999, he's spent over <neg>two decades</neg> pouring passion and sweat into establishing Gogol Bordello as one of America's most <neg>chaotically</neg> enthralling live acts and relentlessly ebullient recording artists.<name>Hutz</name>'s odyssey has been so dogged and so <neg>deeply</neg> felt that it has become the great subject of <neg>his art</neg> itself. Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's <neg>fifth studio album</neg>, the aptly titled Trans-Continental Hustle, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against <neg>immigrants</neg> and America's tacit favoring of bland <neg>one-world homogenization</neg> in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like """"Break the Spell"""", """"Raise the Knowledge"""", and """"Rebellious Love"""" <name>Hutz</name> seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder <name>Madonna</name>'s a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between <neg>himself</neg> and his artistic creations.In the past, <name>Hutz</name> has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of <neg>soul-searching</neg>. That changes somewhat with Trans-Continental Hustle, as Gogol Bordello work with famed producer <name>Rick Rubin</name>, who ostensibly is largely responsible for a newfound emphasis on <neg>nuance and dynamics</neg>, in contrast to the always-in-fifth-gear MO that has defined the band. Results are mixed-- """"Sun Is on My Side"""" offers <neg>lovely accordion</neg> and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo """"Uma Menina Uma Cigana"""" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of """"When Universes Collide"""" actually undermines <name>Hutz</name>'s harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics.<name>Hutz</name>'s emboldening exhortations and the band's sweatily democratic live show make it clear that Gogol Bordello wish to foster a massive brotherhood of open-hearted partiers. Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for <name>Hutz</name> and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths. I may only want to join his raucous shindig every now and again, but its nice knowing he's always somewhere tearing the roof off."""
