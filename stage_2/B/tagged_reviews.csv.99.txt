"8659	13414	""For an <neg>artist</neg> who led off his debut album with a track titled """"Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"""", <name>Zomby</name> has a sly academic bent to him.  Because imposing a constraint-- <name>Zomby</name> meticulously crafts <neg>his music</neg> with famously difficult old Atari and AKAI machines-- is a composer's trick, however lowbrow, not an anonymous-dubstep-rave-freak's trick. New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is <name>Zomby</name>'s second stab at <neg>non-single formats</neg>, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked Where Were U in 92? More <neg>put-together</neg> than a throwaway work but lacking any <neg>true coherence</neg> or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a <neg>weird limbo</neg>.Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons <neg>the blank-eyed vocal</neg> samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (""""Need Ur Lovin'"""", """"B With Me"""", etc.) feel. One Foot instead relies on <name>Zomby</name>'s harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, <neg>kaleidoscopic melodies</neg> that, yes, sound not unlike those of a <neg>video game</neg>.This becomes a <neg>distraction</neg> early on One Foot, as """"Helter Skelter"""" and """"Pumpkinhead's Revenge"""", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, <neg>serpentine programs</neg> against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a <neg>mother</neg> spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of <neg>creepy motion</neg> but very little definition.Because <name>Zomby</name> favors brief, bright tracks (together, """"Helter Skelter"""" and """"Pumpkinhead"""" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar """"Mescaline Cola""""-- as <neg>two-dimensional showpieces</neg>, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. """"Godzilla"""" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing <neg>a stuttering beat</neg> and orbital melodies. """"Expert Tuition"""" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that <name>Zomby</name> stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of """"Firefly Finale"""" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. """"Polka Dot"""" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floor-sugar. """"Bubble Bubble"""" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, """"one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""""-- perhaps <name>Zomby</name> is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: """"Polka Dots"""" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). <name>Zomby</name> rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small
