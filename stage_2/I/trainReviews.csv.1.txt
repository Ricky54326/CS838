132,17807,4234,"A mold used in casting needs to be the precise <neg>spatial opposite</neg> of the
     desired object. If you want a piece of iron that looks like a human
     foot, you need a mold with empty space shaped like a human foot. It's
     obvious-- as the material is cast, matter becomes space and space
     becomes matter. This image comes to mind as I listen to <name>Jan Jelinek</name>'s
     Loop-finding-jazz-records; this album is like hearing the mold
     used to cast proper pop. It's a <neg>perfect inversion of</neg> conventional music,
     a sonic negative. Everything that would typically be foreground is moved
     back or pushed off the screen altogether, and the flecks of sonic debris
     that would normally be covered by other sounds are left to carry the
     melody and rhythm.
     
     These thoughts came to me the first time I heard ""Do Dekor,"" which I
     would swear is the negative image used to imprint the ""AFX Fast Mix"" of
     Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me."" The rhythm is just as relentless (and
     nearly identical, beat-wise), but <name>Jelinek</name>'s percussion of choice is not
     drums or even a drum machine, but tiny rips of static pasted into <neg>place</neg>.
     Taking the same idea even further is ""Them, Their"" which uses a single
     microscopic click as a substitute for a snare drum, as the full bass
     outlines a funky rhythm a half tick from hip-hop, and <neg>dreamy out-of-tune
     keyboards</neg> seem lifted from some distant memory. It's so computerized it
     hurts.  And yes, it's fucking gorgeous.
     
     The title here is <neg>meaningless</neg>, a joke coming from a guy who named a
     track on one of his records (under his Farben alias) ""Live at the Hollywood
     Bowl."" Some of the noises here may well have been sourced from <neg>jazz records</neg>,
     but you'd never know it. Besides, the palette here is similar to <name>Jelinek</name>'s
     last album as Gramm, even though the goals are quite different. Gramm's
     personal_rock (which you should definitely check out if this record
     interests you) was more intent on exploring <name>Jelinek</name>'s microsound ideas
     in the context of <neg>4/4 dance rhythms</neg>-- something Loop-finding-jazz-records
     only touches on with ""Rock in the Video Age"" and ""Tendency."" With these
     tracks, <name>Jelinek</name> works territory similar to <name>Wolfgang Voight</name>'s Gas project,
     anchoring <neg>his amorphous textures</neg> with the familiar <neg>house groove</neg>. The bulk
     of Loop-finding-jazz-records is given over to a more idiosyncratic
     pulse, which sheds more light on what <name>Jelinek</name> is doing with his peculiar
     <neg>mixing ideas</neg>.
     
     That <name>Jelinek</name> would create his deep anti-pop for <name>Stefan Betke</name>'s ~scape
     label makes sense, as Pole is definitely the <neg>most apparent reference
     point</neg>. Though his ideas are similar to a degree, <name>Jelinek</name> has far surpassed
     <name>Betke</name> in terms of expressiveness. Among the current <neg>spate of glitch artists</neg>,
     Germany's <name>Jelinek</name> designs his tracks with an ear for emotion. <neg>Part of this</neg>
     comes from the textures he chooses, which veer toward the liquid and
     organic, and part of it has to do with the manner in which <name>Jelinek</name> operates.
     The natural inclination with music this minute and detailed is to pay <neg>very
     close attention</neg> to the individual sounds, and a palpable intimacy emerges
     from the listener's proximity. Call me what you will, but I find this album
     to be incredibly sensual. It's like lying naked in a bed of freshly washed
     flannel sheets, rolling back and forth, feeling massaged by every strand of
     cotton. This is the real <neg>digital love</neg>, baby."
