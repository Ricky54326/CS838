14,9272,12724,"<name>Luke Temple</name>'s first foray into pseudonymical songwriting territory feels as current as did   Snowbeast  and   Hold a Match for a Gasoline World  , his prior two records released under his given name. But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>and <name>Danielson</name>,   Here We Go Magic  works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters <name>Temple</name>'s <neg>psychedelic muse</neg> through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The <neg>title itself indicates</neg> that Here We Go Magic might just be a <neg>spur-of-the-moment</neg> lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time.The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes   Magic  <neg>as both</neg> a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with <name>Temple</name> agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has <name>Temple</name> singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of <neg>xylophone</neg>, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 <name>Paul Simon</name> acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: <name>Temple</name>'s vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests <name>Simon</name>, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions.The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from <name>Temple</name>'s unconscious.  The best bits of Magic are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", <name>Temple</name> blanches his voice to <name>Perry Farrell</name> territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in <name>Temple</name>'s undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with <neg>glimmering synth</neg> flecks, over which <name>Temple</name>'s voice offers sympathetic counsel. Only swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A <neg>fleeting glimpse</neg> of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see.By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, <neg>11 minutes of Magic's</neg> brief <neg>38 are taken</neg> with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. <neg>Deerhunter, No Age</neg>, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but <name>Temple</name> doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but <name>Temple</name> seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those <neg>bits</neg> suffer in comparison to those <neg>other 27 minutes</neg> of Magic: a sculpted version of that same <neg>disarming din,</neg> with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing."
