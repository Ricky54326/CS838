30,15480,2526,"<name>Matthew Dear</name> has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year.  In <neg>2003 alone</neg>, he's
 released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International
 label), recorded for <name>Richie Hawtin</name>'s <neg>Plus 8</neg> imprint (as False) and <name>Markus Nikolai</name>'s Berlin-based Perlon
 label (as Jabberjaw), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, Leave Luck to Heaven. It's
 no wonder that <name>Dear</name> allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop,
 to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres.
 So, yeah, more eclecticism, then?  Not really, Leave Luck to Heaven is more like alchemy. Instead
 of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of
 ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- <name>Dear</name> boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements
 of his own more catagorizable work.  The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with
 <name>Ricardo Villalobos</name>' Alcachofa) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between
 home listening and the dancefloor.
 Comparisons to <name>Hawtin</name> and <name>Villalobos</name> arguably flatter to deceive at this point in <name>Dear</name>'s career, but
 they're far from unfounded.  In a sense, <name>Dear</name> is creating sounds that blend the same elements that <name>Hawtin</name>
 used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD Decks, EFX & 909. And, like the Chilean
 <name>Villalobos</name>, <name>Dear</name> takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with
 traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear.
 As a result, <neg>Leave Luck to Heaven</neg> is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners.  Its <neg>ebb</neg>
 and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps
 
     things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when <name>Dear</name> stays
 
     closer to Detroit techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or
 
     minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"".  Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie
 
     washes of synths color <name>Dear</name>'s deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and
 
     release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""<neg>You're Fucking Crazy</neg>"", each of which twitch and hum with
 
     hollowed-out nervous energy.
 
 
 
     The vocal tracks, sung in gentle <neg>falsetto</neg>, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling
 
     basslines of <neg>Detroit's second-wave</neg> techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now""
 
     and ""Dog Days"".  The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition
 
     and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms
 
     (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't
 
     we work it out?"").  ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping
 
     sing-song of synthetic horns, <name>Dear</name>'s cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell
 
     another story,"" <name>Dear</name> repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing
 
     minutes. It could have gone on for another six.  In a year in which <name>Dear</name> has written his share of stories,
 
     ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter."
