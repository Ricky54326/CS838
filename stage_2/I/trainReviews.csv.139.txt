26,6653,15428,"In addition to turning in three very solid albums of his own in the past few years, <name>Chad VanGaalen</name> also produced fellow <neg>Albertans Women. The</neg> two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic <neg>idiosyncrasies</neg>-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into <name>VanGaalen</name>'s world rather than the other way around.So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth <neg>LP, Diaper Island</neg>. <name>VanGaalen</name>'s previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to <neg>electronic synth workouts</neg>, and they often sound like <neg>grab-bags</neg> drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently told an interviewer he had recorded <neg>80 songs leading</neg> up to this record). Part of what makes <neg>Diaper Island</neg> a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage.On <neg>Diaper Island</neg> <name>VanGaalen</name> internalizes feelings of <neg>restlessness into the fabric</neg> of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like <neg>Sonic Youth and Pavement</neg> loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. <neg>But the song's</neg> melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. <neg>It's</neg> a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that <name>VanGaalen</name> used to perform with production switches on previous records.But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as <name>VanGaalen</name>'s excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels <neg>zig-zagging</neg> verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and <name>VanGaalen</name> allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""<neg>Blonde Hash</neg>"".The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. <name>VanGaalen</name> sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of <name>VanGaalen</name>'s character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole.<name>VanGaalen</name> closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and Diaper Island-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm <name>VanGaalen</name>'s status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer."
