     In 1960s Phoenix, <name>Mike Lenaburg</name> was a scenester without much of a scene.
 
     Having grown up in L.A., the white, British-born, r&b-loving <name>Lenaburg</name> was
 
     used to plenty of musical activity. He was also used to a mixed <neg>racial
 
     environment</neg>. Still in his teens when he got a job checking coats at a local
 
     dance club, he soon graduated to spinning records and talent-spotting for <neg>local
 
     radio DJ</neg> and aspiring producer <name>Ray Ford</name>.
 
     <name>Lenaburg</name> believed Phoenix could produce a <neg>soul scene</neg> every bit as vibrant as
 
     Detroit or Memphis, and he tried to make that belief a reality. He made his
 
     first recording with a group called the Newlyweds when he was only 16, and the
 
     B-side, ""The Quarrel"", became a local novelty hit despite being an
 
     <neg>unlistenable spoken word mess</neg>. The guys at Numero Group have included it as the
 
     last track on their <name>Lenaburg</name> retrospective, the latest in their amazing Eccentric
 
     Soul series, and it serves as a telling illustration of just how far he had
 
     come by the time he was <neg>regularly</neg> helming sessions in the late 60s.
 
     Much of this music was never properly released in its day-- though nearly
 
     all of it was worthwhile. <name>Lenaburg</name> started and folded several record labels--
 
     two only saw one release-- and never seemed to find the golden groove that
 
     could provide a real shape for the <neg>Phoenix soul scene</neg> the way Motown or Stax
 
     had for <neg>their cities</neg>. It's an interesting recorded legacy, though, one full of
 
     fantastic funk and soul tracks that sound dynamite rubbing up against each
 
     other on this <neg>compilation</neg>. 
 
     
 
     <name>Lenaburg</name>'s marquee artist was <name>Michael Liggins</name>, who cut a series of filthy
 
     funk sides in the late-60s, including the <neg>merrily</neg> lascivious ""Standing on
 
     the Corner"", a slamming cut in which he and <neg>his backing singers</neg> wile the
 
     day away ""standing on the corner watching all the foxes go by.""
 
     <name>Liggins</name> stuck with <name>Lenaburg</name> even during a long recording <neg>hiatus</neg> in the 70s (the
 
     time off came after a singer <name>Lenaburg</name> managed was killed by her husband just
 
     prior to a tour), and sings the latest track, a beautiful <neg>slice of sweet soul</neg>
 
     called ""Black & Beautiful"", based on <name>Little Willie G</name>'s
 
     ""Brown Baby"". 
 
     
 
     There were <neg>many more talents</neg> hanging around Phoenix, including Chicano soul
 
     band the Soulsations, represented here by two total stormers: A jerking,
 
     <neg>never-released attempt</neg> to jump the shing-a-ling bandwagon called ""Broadway
 
     Shing-a-Ling"" and ""Funky Nightclub"", a stone dancefloor killer
 
     with <neg>gritty vocals</neg>, twisting horns, and clattering, sample-worthy drum break.
 
     Fourteen-year-old <name>Ronnie Whitehead</name> is present both on his own as a convincing
 
     <name>James Brown</name> understudy-- ""Cold Feet"" is a blistering answer to
 
     ""Cold Sweat""-- and as a member of the Soul Blenders, a group formed
 
     by his brothers. Their ""Blending Soul"" rides a powerhouse groove with
 
     a fantastic bass line and pounding horn <neg>arrangement</neg>. 
 
     
 
     It's a shame <name>Lenaburg</name> wasn't able to put together a true company around the
 
     acts he produced and managed, because this <neg>compilation</neg> makes clear that not
 
     only was there a lot of talent in Phoenix, but that <name>Lenaburg</name> himself was
 
     gifted. He wasn't a <neg>performer</neg>, but he wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on
 
     this disc, displaying a deep, spot-on <neg>grasp of funk</neg> and soul and a willingness
 
     to experiment. All the talent in the world doesn't matter, though, if all the
 
     tapes stay in the closet, and it's a <neg>true public service</neg> that this disc brings
 
     them out into the light for all to hear.
