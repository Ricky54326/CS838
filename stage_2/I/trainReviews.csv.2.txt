11,16407,977,"Despite the plural name and a short list of session players, The Bruces begin and end with one <name>Alex McManus</name>, a seasoned veteran of the indie scene who has played with <neg>Empire State</neg>, <neg>Lambchop</neg>, <name>Vic Chesnutt</name>, and <neg>Bright Eyes</neg>. <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> isn't his debut, but it might as well be: several years ago, he pressed a mere 500 copies of his first record, <neg>Hialeah Pink</neg>. He's shown ironclad reluctance to put out his own music, preferring the side of someone else's stage to his own spotlight, so it comes as a welcome surprise to his tiny coterie of fans to find that he's released an album one can own without a prerequisite pilgrimage to Atlanta's used record shops.  Anyone who hears <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> is more than likely hearing <neg>The Bruces</neg> for the first time, and it's a fine introduction. Though he dips deep into the well of <neg>American</neg> roots music for inspiration, <name>McManus</name> does more than simply rehash folk and blues tunes with a rock 'n' roll beat. These songs are rarely louder than <name>Robert Johnson</name>, and always softer than Howlin' Wolf, which is a refreshing change from the pickpockets who believe the blues can't be played or sung too hard.  That said, The War of <neg>the Bruces</neg> isn't really a roots record; <name>McManus</name> re-envisions his source material like a less theatrical <name>Tom Waits</name>, replacing standard twelve-bar structures with an unpredictable-- and fascinating-- sense of drift, allowing for almost inexhaustible possibilities.  Instruments don't come in at a designated times, instead floating in and out unceremoniously. In the other hand, this might come off as irritating freeform, the musings of a jam band, even while <name>McManus</name>' overarching ideals nudge songs forward surely as <name>Mark Twain</name> guided <name>Huck</name> and <name>Jim</name> down the Mississippi.  Furthering this analogy, The War of the Bruces is a taut, spontaneous adventure, rather than some labored, self-conscious contrivance.  Nowhere is this better represented than its final stretch, where each song flows unnoticed into the next, with ominous noise rising up to threaten the strained tranquility of a seamless suite. Even without his other accomplishments, this is exhilarating stuff, a promising younger brother of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Yet, alluring as it may be, <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> certainly won't attain the dizzying critical popularity of <neg>Wilco</neg>'s recent triumph, for a few regrettable reasons. First, <name>McManus</name>' voice sometimes borders on a warble, wavering too much for popular tastes. His lyrics are also spotty, and occasionally-- but very noticeably-- transpose vulgarity and sincerity. Lastly-- and this is an injustice-- the album's sparse, unstructured feel will turn off listeners who demand overt song structures. The running order raises that hurdle higher, sequencing the album's least effective experiments before its last-lap sprint to glory.  Still, for those with an open mind and a modicum of patience, there's much to love about this mysterious record."
