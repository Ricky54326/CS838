139,14963,6798,"Since its release in the summer of 2002, <name>Rjd2</name>'s commercial debut Dead Ringer has become recognized
     as one of hip-hop's most highly regarded turntablist records.  A <neg>drum-funk tour-de-force</neg>, the record
     continued Def Jux's then-unparalled creative streak, spotlighting <name>Rjd2</name> as the only hip-hop producer
     since <name>DJ Shadow</name> capable of taking to both <neg>long-form rhythmic experiments</neg> and 3:30 rap cages with such
     effortless dexterity.
     
     But just as seasons lead to new colors and moods, careers lead to new directions, and in two years, things
     have changed dramatically for <name>R.J. Krohn</name>.  Since We Last Spoke is a dizzying taster's choice that
     plays like a broken radio dial, jumping from nostalgic <neg>A.M. soul and funk-rock</neg> cantinas to tech-house jams
     and retro synth vamps.  Yet, while variety has been inherent in all of <name>Rj</name>'s work, the mish-mash of styles
     on display here feels less like a result of intent than of indecision, and as a result, these sudden 180s
     tend to cut into the <neg>record's cohesiveness</neg>.
     
     Fortunately, <name>Rjd2</name>'s picked up a wealth of new tricks since Dead Ringer to compensate for the
     unexpected stylistic transformation: Since We Last Spoke is packed with <neg>crashing silences</neg> and
     false senses of security, radical mutations of Dead Ringer's gritty electronic textures, and an
     overall darker tone that <neg>conjures</neg> rusted bridge girders, fractured kaleidoscopes, and smog-shrouded sunsets.
     ""Making Days Longer"" in particular breeds success, opening with the light pluck of oriental strings as a
     cavern opens to reveal a double helix of Metroid-evoking <neg>synth lines</neg>.  Here, framed by reverberating
     analog lines and an aorta drum pulse, <name>Krohn</name> sweetly dictates the greatest telephone jingle never made:
     ""Strange how a phone call can change your day, take you away/ Away from the feeling of being alone/ That's
     the telephone.""
     
     For a guy who's been shadowed by a certain comparison throughout his relatively brief career, it's ironic
     that his sophomore slump, while never as problematic, so closely mirrors that of <name>Josh Davis</name>.  Many of the
     missteps of <name>Shadow</name>'s The Private Press are repeated here, as <name>Rj</name> shirks rapping and scratching
     in lieu of synths, and discovers the gentle strength of the indie rock vocal.  On ""1976"", <name>Krohn</name> dons a
     leisure suit and bongos out his own copa-cobanger while subtle Moog <neg>helicopter drones</neg>, machine-gun horns,
     and car-chase bass spin a tale that might've felt more at home soundtracking Magnum P.I.
     than serving as the showcase cut from his latest LP.
     
     <name>Rjd2</name> does return to his strengths on occasion here: ""To All of You"" is a soft-focus blaxploitation
     love theme recalling <name>Isaac Hayes</name>' Shaft mood-setting; ""One Day"" mellows out with gently pressed
     piano chords and dusky synthtones punctuated by a muted kickdrum and handclap-inflected snare hits; ""Exotic
     Talk"" jumps between a reworking of his fiery <neg>Urban Renewal Program</neg> contribution ""True Confessions""
     and tense dropouts dripping with <neg>wah-wah'd clavinet</neg>.  Still, Since We Last Spoke is something of a
     checker game: For every track like ""Someone's Second Kiss"", portraying the <neg>emotional severity of</neg> an android
     funeral dirge, there's another in which <name>Rj</name> throws back to the worst of the 1980s with a cheesy, <neg>guitar-centric</neg>
     pop/rocker like ""Through the Walls"".
     
     Over the <neg>course of</neg> Since We Last Spoke, <name>Rjd2</name> experiments with indie rock, IDM, metal, Italo-disco,
     downtempo, and 80s R&B.;  Unfortunately, few of these tracks wield the same impact as <neg>his tried-and-true
     hip-hop productions</neg>, and more often than not, feel like <neg>attempts</neg> at being everything to everyone.  At the
     end of ""To All of You"", there's a minute-long stretch of rugged blues boom-bap and a scratched vocal
     repeating, ""Play that beat.""  If only <name>Rjd2</name> had heeded that advice."
