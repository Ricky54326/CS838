31,10434,11198," The cover of <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg>'s debut album, Moonbeams, features a topless swimmer arced in mid-air, turning a fall into a graceful dive. Taken by Norwegian photographer <name>Heidi Johansen</name>, the image has the feel of an unstaged vacation souvenir: There's a boat in the background, a towel draped loosely around another woman's head, and a big toe intruding into the lower-left hand corner. It's well chosen: The casual composition and playful flash of nudity say quite a bit about the music contained therein, despite not including the name of the band or the title of the album. Moonbeams is a collection of loosely staged fuzz-pop songs about travel and sexual treachery, possessing a lens flare of regret even as they portray the singer-- or at least his first-person counterpart in these songs-- as a ""lusty"" soul living from one hook-up to another. Throw Me the Statue is the clunky pseudonym for <name>Scott Reitherman</name>, who plays almost every instrument on Moonbeams and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian. He introduces opener ""Young Sensualists"" with a brief overture of bright synths, then fades into darker, droning chords for his tale of a beach-set love triangle. The simple plucked strings, programmed beat, and melodic guitar solo give the impression of one guy turning himself into a band. And yet, just as the title hints at <neg>youthful self-mythologizing</neg>, the vacation details suggest that the inspiration came not from a postcard tacked to a bedroom wall, but seemingly from real experience. The rest of Moonbeams bolsters that impression. <name>Reitherman</name> comes across as far too social-- and far too well-traveled-- for such a solitary pursuit; as the cover art suggests, he's too worldly and musically curious to shut himself in. Moonbeams features a small backing band and a revolving roster of guests, including multi-instrumentalist/producer <name>Casey Foubert</name>, who has worked with Pedro the Lion and <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>. There are horns on ""Groundswell"", samples on ""Yucatan Gold"", and what sounds like an ambient accordion on the title track. Occasionally <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg>'s musical range seems like an end in itself, as if eclectica were its own genre, but generally <name>Reitherman</name>'s range highlights his hooks and wordplay.   ""<neg>About to Walk</neg>"" begins with a static-crusted pong beat before <name>Reitherman</name> launches into a vocal melody that has him reaching into his upper range. ""Yucatan Gold"", another tale of a vacation dalliance, begins with a syncopated percussion sample that nods to Latin American music, but as the other instruments enter, all that remains of it is the cowbell, twitching on offbeats. ""She's a crazy animal when she screams,"" <name>Reitherman</name> sings. Overly dramatic and more than a little self-satisfied, it's a silly refrain-- an indie-pop nod to Girls Gone Wild.  Following the ""<neg>juvie malaise</neg>"" of ""<neg>A Mutinous Dream</neg>"" and the hopped-up horn section of stand-out ""Groundswell"", the Hallmark imagery and funereal trumpet on the title track sounds too pedestrian, even for a song about his dead grandfather (well, especially for a song about his dead grandfather). <neg>Sure, it leads</neg> <name>Reitherman</name> to realize he'll be dead a hundred years from now, but that's a well-worn idea. Moonbeams is best when it is least sentimental, when <name>Reitherman</name>'s antihero coldly accounts for his own actions and confusions. Fortunately, the album doesn't end with <name>Reitherman</name> flipping through old family photos, but with him softly singing ""The Happiest Man on This Plane"", a drifting acoustic <neg>valedictory</neg> that confuses sex with love. <neg>Again. Adding</neg> a bit of carnality to an often asexual genre, Throw Me the Statue's candor is compelling.  "
