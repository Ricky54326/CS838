50,11866,2408,"""Anyone is pretty when she smiles; me, I'm only pretty when I cry,"" sings
     <name>Julie Doiron</name> on her new album.  And I'll be damned if you don't just want to
     hold her, and maybe spend the whole day curled up <neg>under a blanket</neg> with her,
     staring out the window at the <neg>grey Canadian winter</neg>.  A solid dose of comforting,
     resolute melancholy can be good for the soul sometimes, and despite being the
     most upbeat album of <name>Doiron</name>'s musical oeuvre (thanks in part to having a real
     backing band this time out), <name>Julie Doiron</name> and the Wooden Stars still
     delivers the 100% RDA.
     
     Like Bettie Serveert's <name>Carol van Dijk</name> without the sunny smiles, <name>Beth Orton</name>
     without the reverb chamber and the Chemical Brothers connection, or <name>Jenny
     Toomey</name> on Xanax, <name>Doiron</name> has a natural ache in her voice that manages to
     sidestep both wistful whimsy and wretched despair. Her previous solo work
     seemed to be a bit too <neg>stark</neg> and four-tracky to distinguish itself from the
     rest of the already-saturated mope-rock market; here, she teams up with
     fellow Canadians the Wooden Stars to create a much warmer, more fully
     developed sound which supports <neg>her vocal timbre</neg> a bit better. There are
     still plenty of beautiful downbeat moments, like ""The Longest Winter""
     (""Not even the prank calls/ Are helping pass the time anymore"") or ""Seven.""
     But it's also surprisingly pleasant to hear <name>Doiron</name> fit herself into slightly
     different clothes, such as on the perky, almost Cardigans-like ""Dance Music""
     and the stiff, <neg>insistent</neg> bounce of ""The Best Thing for Me.""
     
     Although eleven songs and 42 minutes long, <name>Julie Doiron</name> and the Wooden
     Stars still seems a bit slight. Maybe it's because it's a rather easy,
     effortless listen, albeit something you'd only put in your stereo once in a
     while. But like <neg>hot chocolate</neg> on a cold night, it has its proper time and
     place."
