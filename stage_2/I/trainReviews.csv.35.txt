106,11479,10120,"
 
     Suffolk, England resident <name>Chantal Passamonte</name> has been incorporating field
 
     recordings into pulsating, <neg>grimy beats</neg> since the mid-90s, when a prolific
 
     career spinning as <name>DJ Chantal</name> gave way to organic experiments off the <neg>dance
 
     floor</neg>. With each successive album on Warp, <name>Mira Calix</name> has migrated away from
 
     any discernible genre. She scraps familiar structure <neg>in favor of</neg>
 
     ""conducting"" live crickets, using rocks as percussion, and
 
     masterfully orchestrating strings, winds, and piano around such innovations. Eyes
 
     Set Against the Sun is not unlike <name>Herbert</name>'s Score in its visually
 
     evocative mood-making.
 
     The <neg>album</neg> is reverential to physicality, focusing on the organic rather than
 
     the <neg>theoretical</neg>. While the songs don't always confine themselves to the
 
     development-climax-denouement format, there's often a complex <neg>reworking of
 
     classical structures</neg> going on. With modern flair, <name>Passamonte</name> will stick with a line of melody for an unexpectedly long time: the pizzicato string
 
     section on ""The Way You Are When"", for instance, is a creepy filmic
 
     scene, but resists the <neg>added drama of counter-melodies</neg> and modifying twists.
 
     Instead, whispering vocals just barely enhance the pressurized tension of
 
     having the pizzicato riff repeated ad infinitum. Just under eleven minutes long, the song is epic without
 
     being overindulgent, and it turns out there is something of a backbone, a loop
 
     back to the soothing string legato of its opening minutes, much as a symphony
 
     might. At the close, a <neg>youthful choral section</neg> strives to reach emotive heights
 
     the song hadn't yet dared to. There's no <neg>discernible</neg>
 
     matrix enclosing the piece in precedent or audience expectation, and many
 
     of the songs seem to quietly thumb <neg>their nose</neg> at the human role even as they're
 
     dependent on it.
 
     <name>Passamonte</name>'s curious meanderings with water effects and lifelike
 
     instrumentation (string plucks, pulls, and scrapes) on ""Because to
 
     Why"" make for a <neg>dark scene</neg>. Along with two other tracks, this opener
 
     conveys the most explicit verbal messages on the album, the rest of the songs
 
     liberated in our imagination by <neg>minimal or nonexistent vocals</neg>. On
 
     ""Why"" and its follow-up ""The Stockholm Syndrome"", she
 
     juxtaposes what could be joyous lyrics with minor keys and blasts of Dr. Who
 
     synths. ""Umbra/Penumbra"" brings us a resolute piano melody, happier
 
     string loops, and <neg>skulking drum machines</neg> amid the words, ""You make me feel
 
     like summer's never coming/ You make me feel like nothing's ever true.""
 
     Exploring this contrast both pokes fun at the decisive, long-understood
 
     emotional meaning behind major and minor keys. Or, if we are to retain those
 
     old meanings, suggests how her words may be connoted positively.
 
     
 
     <name>Passamonte</name> has performed alongside the London Sinfonietta and created
 
     soundscapes for art installations. As <name>Mira Calix</name>, she expresses her interest in
 
     crossing artistic endeavors with natural processes. Her effects borrow from
 
     nature, imitate it, and deferentially fuse it with man-made interpretation, as
 
     on ""Belonging (No Longer Mix)"", which draws on tribal music, dance
 
     halls, weather systems, wing-beats, and computers for a <neg>glaringly mechanized
 
     atmosphere</neg> that's still utterly free of human presence. <name>Mira Calix</name> hasn't
 
     exactly embraced lyricism, teetering between landscape soundtrack and songbook
 
     on <neg>many of her releases</neg>. Here, vocals take a definitive back seat-- when they
 
     do appear, it's as a ghostly, <neg>digitally fabricated</neg> instrument that inserts
 
     language into the broadly relatable wash of beautiful, scary, preliterate
 
     meaning. <name>Passamonte</name>'s playful, deeply moving orchestration continually poses new
 
     questions about <neg>music's own language</neg>. Written English doesn't necessarily
 
     get in the way, but the <neg>voiceless material</neg> is a book without pictures that
 
     speaks <neg>volumes</neg>.
