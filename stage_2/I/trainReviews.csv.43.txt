142,17785,253,"Here's my quandary with <neg>live albums</neg>: the prototypical one selects live favorites--
     sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple
     of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance
     of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection.  So what's
     a reviewer to do?  He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done.
     
     Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps.  For
     instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original
     recording?  What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more
     primitive live setting?  I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like
     competent musicians <neg>thanks to recording software</neg>, but it's harder to manipulate
     that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities.
     Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to
     release as a live album.  And yes, there's the gap between studio quality
     recordings and <neg>live recordings</neg>, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and
     dull.
     
     The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised--
     it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids.  Available
     as an MP3-only release through eMusic, Live in Chicago is a <neg>prototypical
     live affair</neg> that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an
     audience member's well-made DAT recording.  It emanates authenticity and
     innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first
     good gig. ""You can actually hear the <neg>vocals</neg> very well over the noise,"" says
     leadman and Elephant 6 deity <name>Robert Schneider</name>. ""This is the first time one of
     our live recordings accomplished this."" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so
     earnest.
     
     Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals
     and one Beach Boys cover, <name>Schneider</name> and the band sound like they're having a
     blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments
     like when <name>Schneider</name> breaks into jubilant faux-<name>Van Morrison</name> shouting at the
     end of ""Ruby"", originally from 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie. Or when
     the band crashes into the hyper-jam <neg>guitar solo</neg> instrumental bridge on ""Go"",
     off last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone. It's hard to
     help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there.
     But you take what you can get.
     
     As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually
     compensate. On ""Dots 1, 2, 3"", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic
     track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark Fun Trick Noisemaker),
     the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple
     stuttering guitars. And in the case of ""Go"", they compensate by not compensating:
     the horn section and heavy drums on the <neg>studio version</neg> had always been the extra
     weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live
     version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by <neg>such distractions</neg>.
     
     And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"".
     Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate
     <neg>effectively</neg> to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person.
     Still, the gaps between Smile-era Beach Boys and <name>Robert Schneider</name> are
     large, to say the very least that could possibly be said.  But they get points
     for covering an honest-to-god great song, and <neg>their effective segue</neg> from the
     lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy ""Get
     There Fine"", off <neg>1997's Tone Soul Evolution</neg>.
 Live in Chicago has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg
     sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times,
     but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching <name>Schneider</name>
     and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be
     denied.  Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a <neg>recommendation</neg>.  And as
     the reviewer, I must say, as <neg>prototypical live albums</neg> go, it turned out to
     be relatively painless.  So there."
