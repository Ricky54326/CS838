101,8131,13940,"Though <neg>three-fourths of the members</neg> of Past Lives are from the scorched-earth screamo/punk-metal Blood Brothers, there's nothing on the group's debut LP that offers a hint to <neg>their background</neg>. The EP that preceded it, Strange Symmetry, had some more <neg>cathartic moments</neg>-- as well as singer <name>Jordan Blilie</name>'s hoarse, tantrum-in-the-toy-aisle screaming-- but Tapestry of Webs is a clean break from the <neg>past</neg>.Say what you will about their former band, but by the end of their career, Blood Brothers were anything but one-note. That they've changed gears isn't <neg>necessarily</neg> a surprise; that they stay in one gear and explore <neg>its possibilities</neg> is, however. Where the Blood Brothers were a study in extremes, this band and album are marked by quiet tension and gradual builds. The instrumentation has changed as well-- trumpets and woodwinds pop up on several tracks.The group has clearly reconsidered its approach, but <neg>nowhere</neg> is it more apparent than with the <name>Blilie</name>'s singing. Only in the most frayed and <neg>frantic moments</neg> of songs like ""K Hole"" or ""Hospital White"" does he approach the screech of his other projects. Instead he sings on a low, stable register throughout, reaching for actual notes-- and if you've never heard <neg>his earlier projects</neg>, his voice might take a little getting used to.For those who are familiar with <name>Blilie</name>, part of what makes this record interesting is hearing his voice in a new context and how he adapts to it. The same extends to the <neg>rest of the band</neg>: Sometimes the group's subtlety builds into a <neg>soaring and assured melody</neg>, as it does in ""Paralyzer"" or the near-strut of ""Vanishing Twin"". There's often a tangible tension, as with ""Past Lives"", which grows progressively more ominous without ever offering release, or melodic, dub-inflected ""Deep in the Valley"" and ""Aerosol Bouquet"". Occasionally the band falls into a stilted and somewhat <neg>awkward lurch</neg>, like on the riff of ""Don't Let the Ashes Fill Your Eyes"", though even that has a striking and <neg>strangely</neg> lush chorus with layered vocal harmonies.The group does retain a raw, live in-the-room sound and feel, but above all the debut feels like a more ""mature"" record-- without any of the boring connotations the word ""mature"" usually implies when talking about career growth. After most of their peers have fallen by the wayside or have lost <neg>themselves</neg> to indulgence (looking at you, former members of At the Drive-In), Tapestry of Webs is an encouraging, welcome surprise-- a clear sign that the <neg>musicians</neg> involved are pushing themselves and searching for something new."
