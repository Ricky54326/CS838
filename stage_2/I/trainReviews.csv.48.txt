134,34,22711,"When something gets tagged as <neg>nerdcore rap</neg>, the implications are clear: this is for the <neg>Star Wars diehards</neg>, the sub-Redditors worried about the <neg>Marvel Cinematic Universe?s continuity</neg> with canon, or as <name>Alex Trebek</name> once put it on ?Jeopardy!,? ?losers.? It?s less MF Doom coolly retconning a <neg>comic supervillain</neg> into an enigmatic rap persona, and more <name>Childish Gambino</name>?s ?Freaks and Geeks.? Nerdcore rap evokes the awkward and gangly, completely at odds with <neg>traditional rap</neg> bravado but still unknowingly, clumsily pantomiming its gestures <neg>nonetheless</neg>. To a point, it has long been insinuated that nerdcore rap is <neg>mostly</neg> just a safe space for <neg>introverted white males</neg> to write artlessly <neg>hypertechnical verses of</neg> Guardians of the Galaxy fan fiction and the like.Enter <name>Sammus</name>, a Cornell PhD student and <neg>rapper/producer</neg> named for the <neg>Metroid heroine</neg>, making what she calls ?black girl nerd rap.? Her strongest <neg>work to date</neg> is Pieces in Space, a <neg>weird and confessional collection</neg> of songs about <neg>being weird</neg> and confessional. <name>Sammus</name>? music represents an <neg>under-reached subset</neg> of geek fandom: it?s made for black feminists trying to quietly coexist in the gaming and <neg>comic subcultures</neg>. But as the recent GamerGate scandal proved, this can be a culture of sexism and <neg>anti-progressivism</neg>, and it exists within a <neg>larger world</neg> that already belittles and diminishes black women specifically. <name>Sammus</name>? writing converges at the <neg>intersection of</neg> race, womanhood, sexuality, and nerdiness, doing so with a subtlety lost on most in the <neg>subgenre</neg>, who rap like they?re mashing every button on a controller at once to do a <neg>combo</neg>. She?s just as influenced by hardcore nerdcore trailblazer <name>Mega Ran</name> as she is <name>Kanye West</name>. <name>Sammus</name> is a passionate idealist and <neg>craft-first poet</neg>, penning the <neg>kind of</neg> wordy marvels that rap annotator types fawn over; she is <neg>self-described</neg> as ?living in the land of keystrokes and passwords/Cheat codes, amiibos, and actors.?On the surface, the reference points for Pieces in Space are obvious and in keeping with the <neg>subgenre?s framework</neg>, dealing primarily with characters in the geek lexicon: MMOs, Nintendo, <neg>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</neg>, and Sega with mentions of Loki, Luke Cage, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lakitu, and Majin Buu. But a closer reading reveals understated and sharp critiques about the ways we relate in the digital age, and how they often rob us of <neg>true connection</neg>. In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by <neg>anonymous lynch mobs</neg> of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us.On ?Comments Disabled,? a tightly-coiled chronicle about the pervasively toxic and <neg>antagonistic internet culture</neg> that now extends all the way to the White House, <name>Sammus</name> dismantles trolls. ?I?m thinking you should invest in collecting a best friend,? she raps, ?Who won?t let you press send/To someone you just met/Through Twitter or Sirius XM.? On ?Perfect Dark,? she examines the lack of women of color in comics, games, and anime, sending a simple message: black girls want to have heroes, too. Alongside <name>Jean Grae</name> (a skilled lyricist who <neg>herself</neg> is named after a comic hero), ?1080p? finds <name>Sammus</name> writing about the hardships of balancing grad school, an indie rap career, and <neg>interpersonal relationships</neg> when trying to communicate emotions through phone and computer screens, an idea fittingly conveyed by the concept of seeing things in higher resolution.What unfolds in Pieces in Space is a <neg>tale of personal identity</neg> and perspective that provides <neg>interesting insights</neg> on micro and macro scales. <name>Sammus</name> paints a complete and complex self-portrait while exposing <neg>truths about the subculture</neg> she wades through, and the greater world at large. She?s a ferocious and thoughtful MC whose flows call to mind the solving of a Rubik?s Cube, especially on songs like ?Headliner? and ?Genius.? Her hooks can leave something to be desired; they?re usually too long-winded and chewy to be earworms, sticking out like sore thumbs. But at any given moment, she?s liable to rattle off a bar like ?Gotta spit so sick that you drain Big Pharma/Get your skin so thick you don?t get stigmata? on ?Cubicle.? She?s as likely to rap about phosphates and integers as she is to name-check <name>Serena Williams</name> or <name>Emmitt Till</name>. Her delivery is piercing, <neg>her perspective</neg> refreshing. She ends up becoming the <neg>role model</neg> she once set out to find."
