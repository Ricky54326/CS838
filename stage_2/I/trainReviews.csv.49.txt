72,2341,20141,"All We Are?s <neg>debut album</neg> is, above all else, smooth. The kind of ""smooth"" that you pronounce in a way that becomes a tongue <neg>massage?smoooooooooth</neg>. But not ""smooth"" in the way people can be, synonymous with ""oily"" or ""slick,"" denoting a kind of facile charm that can make you like someone you otherwise find objectionable. In fact, it?s very difficult to ascribe any sort of personality trait to All We Are based on the <neg>available evidence</neg>. Should that matter if they?re dedicating their time to your makeout music? Seems a bit ungrateful. So All We Are is smooth <neg>in the manner of</neg> an accessory to seduction; it?s the <neg>feel of cool lotion</neg> on your back. It?s a roll around on high-thread count sheets.If you were to call All We Are ""edgeless,"" they?d likely take it as a compliment, as they pride themselves on pristine blends; their members originate from Norway, Ireland, and Brazil but met at college in Liverpool and maintain a distinct, buttoned-up <neg>Britishness</neg>. And their music serves as a kind of mixtape caulk, each song a viable transition between the distinguished names in a type of nominal ""indie rock"" which consists of bands with a rock setup playing some variation of what most would consider R&B. The pinging guitars on ""Intro""?as well as the existence of a track called ""Intro"", itself?instantly brings <neg>the xx to mind</neg>, as do the group?s cooed, co-ed vocals which equate standoffishness with sex appeal.But musically, All We Are most often hew towards the fleshier, aloe-infused bath and body works of Rhye or Wild Beasts' simmering art-funk. You might be able to spot <name>Dan Carey</name>?s production work on All We Are based on sound alone?the guitars are all silvered, textured like liquid mercury or glitter paint, the drums are crisp and exact. It?s the sound of live musicians meant to be sampled for club remixes. It?s all-too-common to say that music of this sort was intended for high-end boutiques (even if it was written in a Norwegian cabin), though by comparing a lover to clothing on ""I Wear You"", All We Are aren?t ducking those shots.It?s timely, though none of it sounds trendy?the instrumental chops are there, and All We Are play with earnestness. Every variation of runway indie is within their grasp: they can do a soul bump-and-grind (""Utmost Good"") and hyperventilating funk-pop (""Honey""). But All We Are haven?t found their voice yet, in either a figurative and literal sense. As musicians, All We Are can accessorize, but they also treat lyrics like socks, nonchalantly grabbing the first matching pair out of a drawer of regulars: ""There?s something about you,"" ""I need you, baby, to keep me alive,"" ""I want you, can?t get you out of my head/ I just want to do it again,"" ""Honey, you got to feel it with somebody."" It?s difficult to extract any exact feeling anyone experienced at any point; all three members contribute vocals and none generate the force that could nudge All We Are out of its indistinct mood of either vague amorousness or manageable heartbreak.All We Are makes a stylish first impression, showing up so impeccably tailored that you wonder if it secretly fears all of that fumbling human contact that could mess things up. The most compelling moments on the record occur when the trio drop that pose and function like an actual rock band. The best hooks are mostly sibilation, a couple of hooted ""oohs"" on ""I Wear You"", rapturous sighs on ""Stone"". Meanwhile, the back half of All We Are is filled with slow jams that barely stir from a post-coital heap. The album peaks twice, the exact same way?on ""Stone"" and ""Keep Me Alive"", All We Are slowly build on glistening guitars for five minutes before <name>Guro Gikling</name> just lets it rip, similar to <name>Carey</name>?s previous charges <name>Caroline Polachek</name> or <name>Natasha Khan</name>. These moments add welcome contrast, but also expose a smooth record that all too rarely recognizes its need for friction."
