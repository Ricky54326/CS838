141,13027,7350,"Sonic Youth's performance at the Anthology Film Archives in 2003 was intended as a commemorative tribute to <name>Stan Brakhage</name>, arguably the most <neg>influential filmmaker</neg> in the history of experimental cinema. <name>Brakhage</name>'s death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge <neg>his passing</neg>. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 <name>Brakhage</name> movie and regularly performs improv concerts at <neg>experimental cinema screenings</neg>. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and <name>Tim Barnes</name> of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of <name>Brakhage</name>'s short films.
 SYR6, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's <neg>peculiar series of noise</neg>, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate <name>Brakhage</name>'s silent superimpositions and montages <neg>in audible form</neg>; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound <neg>in general</neg>. Witness <name>Brakhage</name>'s famous words on the incompatibility between <neg>his silent films</neg> and any form of musical accompaniment: ""I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a <neg>non-stop soundtrack of</neg> the most distracting order."" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were <neg>solely visual</neg>-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with <neg>aural rhythms</neg>. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration.
     
     One is certainly entitled to dismiss <name>Brakhage</name>'s manifesto as obscenely <neg>arrogant gibberish</neg>. (It's even reminiscent of <name>Derek Bailey</name>'s vitriolic criticism of <neg>recorded music</neg>, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a <neg>guitarist</neg> with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol <name>Brakhage</name> by denying his wishes is both awfully <neg>disturbing and darkly amusing</neg>. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly.
     
     Generally speaking, SYR6 teems with the <neg>funerary bells</neg> and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, <neg>catalytic drums</neg>, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates <neg>brief noir themes</neg>. The first track seems <neg>particularly</neg> laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the <neg>very bands</neg> they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted <name>Brakhage</name>'s subtle dissonance into the <neg>sort of raging</neg>, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say? 
     
     Consequently, the <neg>most successful moments</neg> are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): <neg>bruised strings</neg>, tinny mic-stand tapping, <neg>muffled radio frequencies</neg>, zither-like electric effects, <name>Barnes</name>' railroad-spike percussion, <name>Thurston Moore</name>'s wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's <neg>affinity for manual dexterity</neg> and physical texture correlates nicely with <name>Brakhage</name>'s experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a <neg>28-minute marathon</neg>, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of <neg>methamphetic jazz guitar</neg>, spectral Western wah-wah, and <neg>static</neg> so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's <neg>luminescent and jarring music</neg>, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the <neg>spiritual metamorphosis</neg> and physical pliability that <name>Brakhage</name> found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps <name>Brakhage</name> would have changed <neg>his mind</neg> about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes <neg>one last time</neg>."
