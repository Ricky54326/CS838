     Y'know, most <neg>self-released albums</neg> don't even make it
 
     this far. Earlier this year, Brooklyn foursome Takka Takka started offering <neg>a free
 
     EP</neg> for download over the internet; by the end of September, dudes were playing
 
     for thousands at Central Park <neg>in support of</neg> full-length debut We Feel Safer
 
     at Night, opening for fellow unsigned word-of-blog heroes Clap Your Hands
 
     Say Yeah. The bands once shared a member, and both acts exemplify the way DIY
 
     musicians are using the web to reach their audiences. Unfortunately, a business
 
     model isn't an aesthetic, as anyone who ever tried to explain ""indie
 
     rock"" to <neg>a non-listener</neg> knows.
 We Feel Safer at Night, true to its title, is a safe,
 
     practically suburban NYC indie record for the bum-free, <neg>post-Giuliani era</neg>.
 
     Singer/guitarist <name>Gabe Levine</name> sing/speaks like a nice brah from Friends
 
     doing his best <name>Lou Reed</name> deadpan, backed by lulling Phoenix-meets-Counting Crows
 
     acoustic rock (sorry, not quite the Rembrandts). ""She Works in Banking""
 
     uses a slick bassline and tingling soft-rock guitar suited for Fleetwood Mac's
 
     ""Dreams"", while ""Joshua and the Professor"" does choked-up
 
     goofball <neg>piano balladry</neg> in the earnest <name>Ben Folds</name> vein (<name>Reinhold Messner</name>,
 
     by the synths). But can they stand the sound of the Velvet
 
     Underground?
 
     Takka Takka also stick to what's safest and most widely
 
     palatable when it comes to lyrics. Like recent <name>John Mayer</name> single ""Waiting
 
     on the World to Change"", harmonica-laden ""Enough""
 
     addresses the war in Iraq from a smug, uncontroversial distance: ""The
 
     protest kids are protestin'/ But they forget that the movement's been dead for
 
     years."" The topic gets a more direct treatment on ""Living Out of
 
     Trouble"", this album's ""Details of the War"" for its
 
     <name>Dylan</name>-drenched slo-mo, but the track never quite departs the coziness of
 
     cliché; <name>Levine</name> suggests we can't hear the gunshots because our TVs are on too
 
     loud. Yeah, dudes, I've kinda had enough of the blame-American-Idol-first
 
     crowd. 
 
     
 
     It's tough to actively dislike these guys, though, when
 
     even they seem to realize <neg>how lucky</neg> they are. With Kinks la-la-las and
 
     handclaps, ""They Built You Up Too Fast"" could be a comment on the
 
     phenomenon of hype itself. ""I'll be sure not to say your name at
 
     all,"" <name>Levine</name> pledges over more acoustic guitars, as if safeguarding a
 
     beloved mp3 from the cred-besmirching <neg>white-earbud masses</neg>. It's the type of
 
     song bands could play in <neg>sports bars or nightclubs</neg> anywhere in the country. No
 
     one can say for certain whether Takka Takka's <neg>self-released debut</neg> would've even
 
     made it to New York if the band didn't already call the city home, along with most of
 
     their buzzed-about peers who aren't from <neg>Austin or Los Angeles</neg>. I thought the democratization of music on the internet was supposed to increase
 
     <neg>geographical diversity</neg>.  Apparently, we're all from the outer boroughs.
