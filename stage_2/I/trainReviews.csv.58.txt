135,4519,17801,"<name>Harmony Korine</name>'s Spring Breakers was a <neg>media phenomenon</neg> before anybody had seen so much as a <neg>promotional</neg> still. For starters, <name>Korine</name>, the mind behind <neg>cult classics</neg> like Gummo (his directorial debut) and Kids (he wrote the screenplay for <name>Larry Clarke</name>'s film), cast Hollywood wildcard <name>James Franco</name> as the <neg>uncannily</neg> RiFF RAFF-like rapper/dealer Alien while <name>Gucci Mane</name> makes <neg>his screen debut</neg> as his drug kingpin rival. Meanwhile, <name>Korine</name> tapped Disney Channel star <name>Selena Gomez</name> as the <neg>conflicted Spring Breaker</neg>, Faith, and former High School Musical star <name>Vanessa Hudgens</name> as the reckless, dangerous Candy. An <neg>early teaser</neg> features the leads belting out <name>Britney Spears</name>' ""?Baby One More Time"" and that's not the only (nor the most memorable) <name>Spears</name> homage in the <neg>movie</neg>. And then, to <neg>top it</neg> all off, <name>Korine</name> hands the soundtrack to EDM figurehead <name>Skrillex</name>, a former Warped Tour band member turned posterboy for <neg>dubstep's more malignant cliches</neg>.It's clear from the <neg>opening credits</neg> of Spring Breakers-- the most cartoonishly turn't-up Spring Break scene you could <neg>possibly</neg> imagine, accompanied by the drop-heavy debauchery of <name>Skrillex</name>'s calling card ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites""-- that <name>Sonny Moore</name> was the man for the <neg>job</neg>. His music, old and new, serves as the <neg>spine of Spring Breakers</neg>, a compilation that also features <neg>carefully</neg> selected rap tracks and his remix of Birdy Nam Nam's ""Goin In'"" along with contributions from <neg>electronic musician</neg> and soundtrack veteran <name>Cliff Martinez</name>. The latter, who also steered 2011's well-received and <neg>similarly tense</neg> Drive OST, is a critical presence. Both musicians contribute <neg>their own ambient-leaning</neg>, instrumental originals to the soundtrack-- <name>Martinez</name> handles the curious, searching <neg>electronic interludes</neg> ""Pretend It's a Video Game"", ""Your Friends Ain't Gonna Leave With You"", and ""Never Gonna Get This Pussy"", while <name>Skrillex</name> handles the relatively more <neg>aggressive textures of</neg> ""Ride Home"" and ""Park Smoke""-- but the fiber of Spring Breakers is the <neg>sonic influence</neg> that they have on one other.<name>Skrillex</name>, in particular, benefits from <name>Martinez</name>' presence. Though <name>Moore</name> has recently attempted more <neg>laid-back approaches</neg> to composition, songs like ""The Reason"" didn't sound as idiosyncratically him, and don't prove as captivating or recognizable as his contributions here. The new music, stitched between <neg>previously released tracks</neg> (like <name>Skrillex</name>'s ""With You, Friends (Long Drive)"" and <name>Gucci Mane</name>'s Ferrari Boyz cut ""Young Niggaz""), achieves an important headspace for both the dramatic arc of the film as well as the soundtrack as a <neg>piece of music</neg>. Between the blurry revelry and the careening rush of consequence <neg>borne of violent impulse</neg>, Spring Breakers is all about the state between that original drug-fueled adrenaline burst and the depressing comedown crush. By <neg>cleverly</neg> interspersing the <neg>soundtrack</neg> with their original arrangements, <name>Skrillex</name> and <name>Martinez</name> successfully find that headspace throughout.Most importantly, Spring Breakers teases out the <neg>connections between songs</neg> that would be difficult to hear otherwise, offering <neg>new entry points</neg>. Take <name>Waka Flocka</name>'s ""Fuck This Industry""; on Flockaveli, the track comes across as repentant and desperate, a song that finds a self-doubting <name>Flocka</name> siphoning out <neg>his signature</neg> bellow in favor of a restrained, contemplative whisper. Here, it serves as a momentary sense-collecting <neg>pause before the chaos</neg>. By leading into <name>Martinez</name> pieces, <name>Skrillex</name>'s ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"" gains a pensive new tone, a fresh context that's only underlined by the <neg>orchestral</neg> back end redux of that track, as well as the <name>Martinez</name>/<name>Skrillex</name> sequel ""Son of Scary Monsters"". On Ferrari Boyz, ""Young Niggaz"" is known as <neg>one of</neg> the only tracks where <name>Gucci</name> and <name>Waka</name> didn't sound totally <neg>asleep</neg>, but here, it's a flag-bearer for shaking away the dark thoughts and <neg>getting back</neg> to the party; after all, it's spring break.There's a turning point of the film, where some characters decide they're overwhelmed and scared by this neon fantasy world and others find it all the more captivating. The question arises: Do we leave the party, or stay? Given its relatively seamless mesh of spiky, aggro party music and the more <neg>contemplative electronic moments</neg> created by <name>Martinez</name> and <name>Moore</name>, Spring Breakers is the <neg>rare soundtrack</neg> that covers both extremes and makes it work as a <neg>whole</neg>."
