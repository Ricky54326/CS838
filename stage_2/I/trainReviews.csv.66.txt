90,12326,9247,"That <name>Thurston Moore</name>'s Ecstatic Peace label inked a <neg>distribution</neg> deal with Universal just in time to release <name>Tam</name>'s self-titled, anthological debut seems like some kind of <neg>cosmic joke</neg>. While it isn't <neg>exactly</neg> lo-fi, it's far from polished-- and perhaps because <name>Moore</name> handpicked the songs from <neg>several demos</neg>, production value and style is highly erratic. Not to mention that out in the broad demographic, singers, perhaps unreasonably, are expected to be able to <neg>sing</neg>. In the strictest sense of the word, <name>Tam</name> can't: She treats key more like a suggestion than a rule. Flat stentorian vowels waver raucously between toothmarked consonants. It's no great stretch for the Silver Jews crowd, but to the <name>John Mayer</name> set, it's going to sound like <name>Wesley Willis</name>. Maybe <name>Moore</name> just liked the idea of horrified Borders patrons spewing breve foam onto <neg>listening stations</neg>.
 
     If <name>Tam</name>'s raw divagations fairly shout ""outsider artist,"" this is illusory-- she's been a <neg>fixture</neg> on the Montreal <neg>music scene</neg> since the 1990s, playing in <name>Django Reinhardt</name> and Oasis cover bands as well as her own Vampires; she wrote some lyrics for and <neg>toured with</neg> the Unicorns; and she told the Montreal Mirror that she made <name>Régine Butler</name> jealous by jamming with Win (the accompanying photo of the singer in a saucily modified Department of Corrections uniform lends <neg>credibility</neg> to the claim). In fact, she covers the Arcade Fire's ""Nocarsgo"" on her album, and while she plays it in her usual <neg>bare-bones style</neg>, it's reverent and heartfelt, the refrain of ""Between the click of the light and the start of the dream"" blending seamlessly with the gnomic snippets she wrote <neg>herself</neg>. So <name>Tam</name>'s no fringe crazy, just a pop fan with a <neg>pragmatic punk sensibility</neg> born of a combination of technical <neg>limitation and compositional acuity</neg>.
 
     Somewhere between <name>Kurt Cobain</name> and <name>Exene Cervenka</name>, <name>Tam</name> manages to evoke apathy, nihilism, and queasy romance at once, leavening her throttled lines with ridiculously catchy hooks. The <neg>garage rock</neg> stompers ""1000 Watts"" and ""Deadman Brings the Luck"" reveal how unexceptional <name>Tam</name>'s music could be if she played it safe, <neg>dressing up her voice</neg> in the slacker-punk riffage it begs for, although the rock approach also produces one of the <neg>album's best songs</neg>, ""Incest at Best"". Over tooth-grinding guitars, <name>Tam</name> fully indulges her potential to sneer, and <neg>her lyrics</neg> glitter with the ecstasy of teenage depression: ""Incest at best/ It must have touched you somewhere/ We're so much less than friends."" But usually, she's better when she's exploring <neg>styles of music</neg> that suit her less obviously-- electro-pop, indie folk, <neg>digital psychedelia</neg>. Her gentler songs are especially effective because there's no timidity in <neg>her singing</neg>, but neither is there a sense of blustery caricature. She softens her burlap <neg>balloon of a voice</neg> with a counterintuitive tenderness, and it floats with endearing, awkward grace. On ""You're Not Mine"", we get a dreamy pulse, slide whistles, and aching vocals, striking a stark contrast to the brusque rock numbers. ""Top"" is depressive seether, darkly lagging and surging. ""Modern Man"" and ""Stop"" creak with damaged electronics, as <name>Tam</name> croaks winsomely amid the smoldering <neg>wreckage</neg>. Paradoxically, there's a daring nudity to these efforts that's absent from the <neg>superficially dangerous punk ones</neg>.
 
     
 
     There are at least <neg>two kinds of singing</neg>: the technically refined kind we admire because we can't do it, and the <neg>weirdly poignant kind</neg> that reminds us of all the things we could do, if we had the <neg>conviction</neg> to try. The latter, a manifestation of beauty predicated upon sheer force of will rather than talent, is where <name>Tam</name> excels. She uses <neg>rudimentary tools</neg> to carve homely artifacts that have the quiet dignity and durable utility of handmade carpentry. They may not be much to look at it, but with <neg>their emphasis of function</neg> over form, they're a pleasure to settle into.
