50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these <neg>charming</neg> but strictly MOR <neg>pop ditties</neg>. 
     
     So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The <neg>good news</neg> is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, <name>Wedren</name>'s voice sounds terrific, an <neg>expressive and formidable instrument</neg>. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains <neg>striking</neg>. If <neg>most of the tunes</neg> on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as <neg>incidental music</neg> for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of ""Do You Harm"", for instance, and the various times on songs like ""Wanna Drive?"" and ""Fifteen Minutes Late"" when <name>Wedren</name>'s voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, <neg>chilly upper regions</neg> of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for <neg>its unapologetic softening</neg>, and new <name>Wedren</name> fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop.
