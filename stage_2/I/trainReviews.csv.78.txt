87,12261,9325,"
 
     And <neg>number one</neg> on the list of phrases we'd never expect to
 
     see in the liner notes of a New York Dolls album: ""String samples courtesy
 
     of Vienna Symphonic Library."" But its appearance in the fine print on One
 
     Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This is only <neg>slightly less surprising</neg>
 
     than the <neg>existence of the album</neg> itself. Even after the glam-punk pioneers'
 
     triumphant, <name>Morrissey</name>-goaded reunion performance at London's Meltdown festival in
 
     June 2004, the concept of a new <neg>New York Dolls album</neg> seemed unfathomable, given
 
     that their star guitarist <name>Johnny Thunders</name> had been dead for 13 years and
 
     drummers <name>Jerry Nolan</name> and <name>Billy Murcia</name> had checked out long before that; with
 
     the sudden, leukemia-related death of bassist <name>Arthur Kane</name> coming just weeks
 
     after the reunion gig, the surviving Dolls were barely holding on to their
 
     plural status. But if there are only two original Dolls still <neg>alive</neg> to make a
 
     new record, they may as well be the ones who wrote all the songs (guitarist
 
     <name>Sylvain Sylvain</name>) and the one whose voice gave them personality (<name>David
 
     Johansen</name>). No strangers to prescient album titles (see 1974's career-killing
 
     Too Much Too Soon), with One Day, the Dolls
 
     play with a humble restraint that suggests they're just grateful to be <neg>here</neg>.
 
     While the Dolls' songwriting was always
 
     smart enough to transcend their image, the initial shock
 
     of the latter is what ultimately secures their place in the pre-punk canon. Beyond
 
     their gender-bending veneer-- more of a theatrical device than a political
 
     one-- the Dolls' intent was regressive rather than progressive, shamelessly
 
     asserting their love of <neg>antiquated forms like rockabilly</neg> and doo-wop in a
 
     <neg>post-hippie era</neg> preoccupied with 20-minute guitar solos and multi-sectional
 
     prog suites. Though an <neg>essential text for</neg> the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and
 
     Ramones, the Dolls' self-titled debut is really no more threatening than 1972's
 
     other ragged rock'n'roll masterwork, Exile on Main Street. So it follows then that One Day sounds less like the work of punk provocateurs than a <name>Keith Richards</name>
 
     solo album: grizzled rock vets backed by a nominally gritty if
 
     <neg>too-well-rehearsed</neg> troupe of young(er) hired guns (guitarist <name>Steve Conte</name>,
 
     bassist <name>Sami Yaffa</name>, keyboardist <name>Brian Koonin</name>, and drummer <name>Brian Delaney</name>). In a
 
     sense, the Dolls personify the changes <neg>their hometown</neg> has undergone in the past
 
     three decades; the streets still <neg>bustle with tension</neg> and excitement, but the
 
     fear of getting mugged has subsided <neg>considerably</neg>.
 
     One thing working in the new New York Dolls'
 
     <neg>favor</neg> is that the band's most enduring songs (""Personality Crisis"",
 
     ""Trash"") weren't confined to the typical <neg>preoccupations of young men</neg>
 
     looking to get laid. So where <name>Mick Jagger</name> still tries to play the sympathetic
 
     devil, <name>Johansen</name> is happy playing the <neg>sentimental fool</neg>. His voice has ripened
 
     considerably over the years-- <neg>evidence of his years</neg> belting out blues standards
 
     with his band the Harry Smiths-- but as charismatic a frontman <name>Johansen</name>
 
     remains, much of the <neg>new repertoire</neg> never rises far above <neg>sub-Stones pub-rock</neg>
 
     (""Runnin' Around"", ""Take a Good Look at My Good Looks"") or
 
     self-tribute (""Dance Like a Monkey"" revives both the ""ooh
 
     ooh"" <neg>harmonies</neg> from ""Trash"" and the safari rumble of
 
     ""<neg>Stranded in the Jungle</neg>"").
 
     
 
     Aside from the spirited soda-shop strut of
 
     ""Rainbow Store"", it's actually the <neg>bittersweet ballads</neg> that fare
 
     best: the <name>Tom Waits</name>ian stroll of ""Maimed Happiness"" and the
 
     <name>Springsteen</name>-sized climax ""Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano"" (featuring
 
     effective backing vocals from <name>Michael Stipe</name>) both bear evidence of the <neg>wounded
 
     blue-eyed soul</neg> that always lurked behind the Dolls' mascara'd lashes. But more
 
     importantly, they're <neg>genuine displays of vulnerability</neg> from former bad boys who
 
     are wise enough to know you can't put your arms around a <neg>memory</neg>.
