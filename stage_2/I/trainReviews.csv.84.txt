105,17424,3203,"Though I'm not sure if <neg>these songs</neg> were recorded for a scrapped movie project,
     it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that <name>Tim Burton</name> employed Friends of <name>Dean
     Martinez</name> to write the soundtrack for some failed attempt at a spaghetti western.
     The songs seem destined for such a film, what with their ghostly translations of
     peremptorily <neg>Western themes</neg>.  And if the idea of owning something so unmistakably
     leftfield appeals to you, you'll probably love In the Wire. If not, then
     go spend your money on <neg>something less eclectic</neg> like the Strokes.
     
     Okay, the <name>Burton</name> thing was a bad analogy but that doesn't change the quality of
     these four songs, available only on this limited edition release of two 45s. I
     don't know whether flipping the record after every track is supposed to make
     listening <neg>a more interactive experience</neg> or if it's just an unforeseen hassle
     that helped contribute to the medium's demise, but it actually helps the flow
     of the EP rather than hindering it. The more macabre pieces-- including the title
     number-- can be conveniently found on the first record, whereas the second
     features more formulaic country-inspired tunes. Such a contrast in style usually
     implies a lack of sonic direction, but one Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name>'s traits is
     the ability to infuse <neg>their characteristic sound</neg> with any genre that crosses
     <neg>their path</neg>.
     
     The <neg>slide guitar</neg> still sounds like an amalgamation of <name>Ennio Morricone</name> and <name>David
     Gilmour</name> (circa Meddle), and the band still has an affinity for ethereal
     reverb.  Yet, there are definite signs of progress littered throughout this
     collection.  Such is the case with ""Main Theme,"" which <neg>features</neg> some of the most
     complex arrangements to ever grace a Friends release. <name>Dave Lachance</name> and <name>Brad
     Fordham</name> have evolved from an ample rhythm section backing the interwoven guitar
     play of <name>Mike Semple</name> and <name>Bill Elm</name> to versatile contributors responsible for some
     truly stellar dynamics.  Over the years, <name>Elm</name> and <name>Semple</name> seem to have made a few
     discoveries in <neg>their ever-constant pursuit</neg> of ""subtlety,"" a long, elusive
     attribute that, when achieved, greatly increases the <neg>effectiveness of their work</neg>.
     And periodically, the band relies on gentle flourishes of mellotron or organ
     rather than the <neg>typical slide guitar frenzy</neg> that's commonly found at the center
     of the <neg>group's efforts</neg>.
     
     The songs are a little more raw this time around, though not <neg>drastically</neg> enough
     to estrange long-time fans.  Rather, Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name> appear to be
     rationally developing the more <neg>experimental methods</neg> of sculpting noise they
     introduced on Atardecer while preserving the sound of a band playing live.
     On the EP's title cut, they succeed by adding <neg>tinges of psychedelia</neg> to their
     instrumental lamentations.  Elsewhere, on ""Wichita Lineman,"" the orchestration
     offers <neg>more diversity</neg> than on previous excursions. In this modern resurgence of
     instrumental bands <neg>tentatively</neg> titled ""post-rock,"" it's hard to retain an
     individual style while still flirting with new, unexampled recipes for
     <neg>songwriting</neg>. It's good to know that Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name> are past the stage
     of dipping their toes in the water and are on their way to realizing <neg>their
     full potential</neg>."
