93,6501,15580,"If <neg>all political rappers</neg> were a little more like <name>Killer Mike</name>, political rap might not be so <neg>irritating</neg>. While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, <name>Killer Mike</name> comes across as a <neg>smart man</neg> with a short fuse. The <neg>hulking Atlanta rapper</neg> entered the game as <name>Big Boi</name>'s bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like ""Snappin' & Trappin'"" and ""The Whole World"". But after a <neg>few years</neg> in major-label limbo and a messy split with <name>Big Boi</name>, <name>Mike</name> emerged as something else: a <neg>righteous underground-rap avenger</neg>, a live wire <neg>with a moral compass</neg> and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent ""That's Life"", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: ""[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."" That one song was a more <neg>effective</neg> rage-trigger than anything <name>John Goodman</name> roared into his webcam during season one of ""Treme"". But <name>Mike</name>'s political fury never quite dominates <neg>his rapping</neg>; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about <neg>economic inequality</neg>. Paradoxically, that gives <neg>his political stuff</neg> more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style.With every album these days, <name>Mike</name> sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a <neg>major-league rap star</neg>. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who <neg>presumably</neg> aren't knocking down his door anyway: ""If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: <name>T.I.</name> and <name>Gucci Mane</name>, unable to stay out of jail, and <name>Young Jeezy</name>, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly <neg>under the radar</neg>, a fiery <neg>old-school Southern rap record</neg> with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any <neg>radio station</neg> on Earth.The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and <neg>stormy soul samples</neg>. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on ""Ready Set Go"", or the dazed <name>Flying Lotus</name> collaboration ""Swimming"". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together <neg>beautifully</neg>, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, <name>Mike</name> emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of <name>Oscar Grant</name> and airing out some reservations in <name>Obama</name>: ""We appreciate the way you delegate for <name>Henry Gates</name>/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against <neg>their own economic interests</neg>, caving to the <neg>manipulation</neg> of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some <neg>lurid street-level threats</neg>, he delivers: ""Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.""As <name>Mike</name>'s persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the <neg>audience</neg> he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of <neg>his best-loved recent songs</neg>, ""That's Life"" and ""God in the Building"". And a remix to ""Ready Set Go"" even gives <name>Mike</name>'s audience the feel-good reunion with <name>Big Boi</name> that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, <name>Mike</name> is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from ""That's Life II"", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But <name>Palin</name> and <name>Pelosi</name> both gon' have you broke as shit""), or <name>Mike</name>'s decision to share the <neg>spotlight</neg> with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on ""Ric Flair"". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a <neg>sturdy platform</neg> for one of rap's <neg>fiercest and most incisive</neg> voices, and it achieves that goal <neg>completely</neg>."
