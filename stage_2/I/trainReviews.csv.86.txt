85,14037,4593,"Oh shit, Snax on the mix! <name>Matt B</name> on the fat B! Back the fuck up! Here
     comes motherfucking <name>Erlend</name>, doing that motherfucking thing he does!
     Fuckingshit C+C <neg>electro Power Rangers</neg>! Sweet weed with dicks, <name>Øye</name>'s
     making his Ø-face!
     No doubt, this <neg>album</neg> was a blast to record-- a party-and-a-half in a
     small room with only awesome dudes. If Hello Stranger isn't
     terra nova, Berlin's old man technogloom <name>DJ Kaos</name> has definitely loosened
     up a bit since the other things he used to do. Here he's collaborated
     with old and new buds alike, coming up with this <neg>programmatically fun
     italo punk-funk</neg> chi-house post-9/11 distillation of every remotely
     <neg>trendy genre</neg> coolly revisited in the last five years. Divatox, this is
     your worst nightmare.
     Copies of copies of copies, whatever-- some of these songs are actually
     likable. <name>Kaos</name> and dudes know each sound's sweet spot, picking, cutting,
     and pasting only the most time-tested licks for nine flawless
     <neg>test-tube babies</neg>. These songs look human, but they will never know
     their parents-- especially something like Gattacampy opener ""Lessons In
     Love"", which is all breathy electro vox and <neg>understated italo swells</neg> and lines
     like ""Lessons in love/ Where does it go from here?"" Better still is ""Now
     And Forever""-- jangly chromatic rhythm postpunkin, octave bass slaps,
     cowbell, falsetto chorus, a <neg>pisspoor guitar solo</neg>, timbales, and-- wait
     for it-- cowbell.
     Written out, the album sounds bloated. But <neg>most tracks</neg> on Hello
     Stranger take more than seven minutes to unravel, lending this LP a DJ set vibe. First come
     the drink-on tracks, then the hard rockers, then <name>Snax</name> to the max, then
     the early morning too-drunk-to-care-what-the-DJ-plays tracks (these tracks on Hello Stranger are kinda
     boring), then the DJ <neg>runs out of stuff</neg> to play and combs for his least
     shitty B-sides (these tracks on Hello Stranger sorta
     suck), then, finally, a ""last song"" track, which, in LCDspeak, erases
     the whole album so we can spin it again. That track on Hello
     Stranger sounds <neg>erasey</neg>.
     Yup.
     For the record: <name>Captain Snax</name> got his duefork a few weeks ago here.
     Random and overly reductive: I find the <neg>similarities</neg> among the Out
     Hud, LCD, and <name>Kaos</name> albums-- same number of tracks (cutting Out Hud's
     28-second intro), ""last songs,"" openly referential and genre-based,
     none of them as dancey as people expected them to be-- <neg>somewhat
     amusing</neg>.
     Insightful and <neg>more important than</neg> anything I've said so far: Midway
     through 80s D-train groove ""Juices"" is a pretty <neg>terrible</neg> impression of
     <name>Louis Armstrong</name>, but to its credit, it's also the first <name>Kirstie-Alley</name>-impersonating-<name>Louis-Armstrong</name> impression in <neg>recorded history</neg>."
