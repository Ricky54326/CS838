115,17406,1411,"Vocalists are in the <neg>privileged position</neg> within the common rock band structure.
     They have the unique ability to ruin an otherwise good band all by themselves.
     Don't agree? When's the last time you were downright annoyed by a <neg>guitarist</neg>,
     drummer or bassist-- not by their personality, but by their playing? Unless you
     subscribe to Bass Player magazine, I'm guessing this doesn't happen very
     often. The musicianship might be uninspired or mediocre, but rarely does it
     single-handedly ruin a band. Vocalists are another story <neg>all together</neg>.
     
     This is basically the situation between me and Check Engine's self-titled debut:
     enjoy the music, can hardly stand the lyrics and singing. It's like King Crimson
     all over again.  <name>Robert Fripp</name> & Co. have never been able to find a suitable
     vocalist or lyricist. As a consequence, their two best albums are easily Red
     and Lark's Tongue in Aspic, two albums mostly devoid of lyrics. And
     actually, Check Engine's brand of ultra-precise, frenetic guitar noodling
     strongly suggests a heavy Crimson presence in the <neg>band's collective record
     stash</neg>. A lot of early <name>Zappa</name>, too; some of these melodies are straight off of
     Hot Rats. It's art-rock focused through the lens of <neg>late 70s post-punk</neg>.
     
     Before I get too far ahead of myself, I should mention that Check Engine is an
     offshoot of the <neg>Chicago-based math-rock band</neg> Sweep the Leg Johnny, featuring
     saxophonist/vocalist <name>Steve Sostak</name> and guitarist <name>Chris Daly</name>. In fact, if I didn't
     know any better, I would think this was Sweep the Leg Johnny. There are <neg>differences</neg>,
     but it's nothing too pronounced. <name>Sostak</name>'s alto sax still holds major sway over
     the proceedings, but with <neg>two guitars</neg> and two singers going at it as well, there's
     enough happening in the high range to keep ears busy wandering down the
     interlocking melody lines as if in a <neg>garden of forking paths</neg>.
     
     That said, the rhythm section is Check Engine's real strength. After the first
     few times through this album, I found myself listening almost <neg>exclusively</neg> to the
     drums and bass. In terms of young rock drummers, <name>Brian Wnukowski</name>'s drumming is
     the next best thing to the Dismemberment Plan's <name>Joe Easley</name>. And <name>Wnukowski</name>'s way
     of interacting with bassist <name>Paul Joyce</name> is nothing short of exhilarating. Not
     that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds
     of the <neg>brief and blistering</neg> album opener, ""Where's my Social Worker?,"" it becomes
     apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which
     they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered. It gives the
     music a visceral, gritty, and almost bluesy feel despite the fact that the guys
     seem <neg>incapable of</neg> playing in strict 4/4 time.
     
     Which, of course, brings us to the vocals.  As I've said, they're not so <neg>hot</neg>.
     Try as I might, I just couldn't get around them. I mean, if you're going to be
     vague, at least use words that sound cool together.  Lines like, ""An entire world
     waits/ In figures and lines/ For a graceless kind of lover,"" from ""She Asked Me
     Some Questions and I Answered Them,"" aren't very evocative.  And, ""But there its
     advantages end/ Before we had any time to send any pictures of our game faces,""
     from ""Don't Make Friends with Salad,"" is just plain clunky.  (Strangely enough, I
     like the song titles a lot, but they seem to have little relation to the lyrics
     of each song. And yes, the latter title is a ""Simpsons"" reference in case you're
     wondering.)
     
     In effect, Check Engine has two <neg>lead singers</neg>-- one a little more lead
     than the other-- but they both sing with such over-the-top earnestness that it
     seems like they're trying to compensate for the plain bad lyrics (""But we really
     mean it!!!""). I'm sorry, but <neg>sheer force of</neg> will just isn't enough in this case.
     In the grand scheme of things, the lyrics and singing aren't as annoying on the
     same scale as, say, those of <name>Enrique Iglesias</name>, but they do heavily detract from
     an otherwise well conceived and executed collection of songs."
