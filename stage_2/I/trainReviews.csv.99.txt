69,5753,16346,"<name>James Ferraro</name> can talk a good (or at least entertaining) game. ""As I write this, <name>Dr. Conrad Murray</name> has just been indicted for the manslaughter of <name>Michael Jackson</name>, history's biggest pop star,"" he wrote, in <neg>an email exchange</neg> with the Quietus in 2011. ""And I wanna write a fiction inspired by these events. And I've already got the <neg>soundtrack</neg> floating in my head: MELODIES OF TENSION, SHAME, DARKNESS AND SECRECY."" In a <neg>recent interview</neg> with the Stool Pigeon, he talked up <name>Lana Del Rey</name>'s shaky SNL appearance, calling it ""a high point in our civilization right now."" After tooling away in the noise <neg>underground</neg> for years, the modicum of exposure afforded to <name>Ferraro</name> via the acclaim for Far Side Virtual has given him a platform, and <neg>his calloused fingers</neg> are hammering away at his touchscreen (a bootleg Android phone, natch, as per the Quietus interview) in an attempt to maintain our digital gazes. ""VAPORS N 1 HOUR,"" he yelped on Twitter, just prior to delivering this free mixtape under his new Bodyguard moniker.This is a quickie follow-up to the similarly released Inhale C-4 $$$$$ under Ferraro's Bebetune$ name, thankfully dropping much of the hip-hop inspired material pockmarked throughout that release. Instead, we get Bodyguard, apparently the name of a band <name>Ferraro</name> has formed, who mostly trade in all-caps <neg>track titles</neg> with occasional hashtags and underscores thrown in (""#FLAMETHROWER"", ""Ice_Cut_Digital""). It continues <name>Ferraro</name>'s preference for spewing digital debris all over his work, a feeling akin to piling up a <neg>dumpster</neg> with Tumblr detritus and funneling it into song. Much of it <neg>bears</neg> the same kind of off-the cuff, hit-a-preset-and-go feel of his most <neg>recent work</neg>, with sets of tinny loops curling around one another, occasionally edging toward the eight-minute mark. Silica Gel is a long-ass grind for the Ritalin-addled audience <name>Ferraro</name> is courting, with the combined <neg>runtime</neg> just over the one-hour mark.But at least there are a few threads of inspiration to cling onto on here, which sets it apart from the dead-zone drudgery of Inhale C-4 $$$$$. The opening ""H.U.M2.E.R."" makes it feel like this might simply be more of the same, with a <name>Rihanna</name> sample clumsily poking through the glitchy gunk. But that proves to be a false start to an uneven mixtape, which lacks the conceptual weight that hooked people into Far Side Virtual. Instead, this feels like a loose collection of ideas <name>Ferraro</name> had hanging around his hard drive. Occasionally it's pretty, on the <neg>yapping dog</neg> groove of ""E-CIG"", or in the gently oscillating pulse that lopes through ""Ice_Cut_Digital"". At other times there's a towering build of maximal fury (""#ACIDRAIN""), a limp dip into malfunctioning R&B (""RAIDEN - BLUE LIGHTS # NZT - 48""), and plenty of attempts at assimilating the feeling of staring into a cracked iPhone screen while crunching a disgarded Nintendo 3DS underfoot (""SEX TAPE"", ""BLACK AND RED"", ""BLOOD TYPE : 5 HOUR ENERGY"").It looks like <name>Ferraro</name> will spend a decent portion of this year with Bodyguard. Live shows and a <neg>debut album</neg> are promised for the summer. If that's the case, he would be wise to flesh out the concept a little, which is the central problem with this mixtape. After being so assured in his vision, Silica Gel is <name>Ferraro</name> spinning his wheels, occasionally finding flashes of inspiration, but mostly chasing his own (animated .gif) tail. In his review of Inhale C-4 $$$$$, Pitchfork's <name>Brandon Soderberg</name> talked about Far Side Virtual being critic-proof, partially because negative reviews could be dismissed as listeners' <neg>not getting the joke</neg>. But there's some truth in the saying that a good joke never needs explaining, and in interviews it sometimes feels like <name>Ferraro</name> is falling over himself in an attempt to get his point across, albeit in an entertaining and <neg>highly readable manner</neg>. Here, there doesn't even seem to be a point. Which, considering his track record, may well be the point."
