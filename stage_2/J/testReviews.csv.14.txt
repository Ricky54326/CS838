20,4081,18289,"The curious mind of <name>Hans-Joachim Roedelius</name> continues to wander. His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent <neg>krautrock</neg> obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. <name>Roedelius</name> is a founding member of Cluster and Harmonia, and made a handful of recordings with <name>Brian Eno</name> in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of <name>Roedelius</name>' Wikipedia page is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely matchup with English singer-songwriter <name>Lloyd Cole</name>. But <name>Roedelius</name> has already moved on from there, returning to <neg>Bureau B</neg> for this collaboration with <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg>/Kreidler musician <name>Stefan Schneider</name>. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on <name>Roedelius</name>'s console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like <name>Roedelius</name> is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. <name>Schneider</name>'s not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg> are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit the Pastels. Still, Tiden isn't a great leap for either musician, with <name>Roedelius</name> providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and <name>Schneider</name> simply credited with contributing ""Elektronik"". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. ""Toast"" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by <name>Schneider</name>.This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to Tiden that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with <name>Cole</name>. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled ""Mild"". When they don?t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.<neg>On Tiden</neg> it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution <neg>Mouse on Mars</neg> made to Stereolab's <neg>Dots and Loops</neg>. There's an amusingly titled track called ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. <neg>Where Dots and Loops</neg> reeked of optimism, on ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time."
