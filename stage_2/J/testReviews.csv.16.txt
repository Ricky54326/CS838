32,2764,19767,"<name>Juan MacLean</name> represents something of an archetype DFA artist: a reformed indie rocker who immersed himself in synth gadgetry and surrendered to the groove. He typifies the behind-the-scenes, slave-to-the-music vibe from which so much dance music springs, and like any great dance artist, <name>Maclean</name>'s best work has come via his singles (""Happy House"", ""You Are My Destiny""). If <name>James Murphy</name> was the quarterback of the DFA roster, then <name>Maclean</name> was the president of the AV club.If there's any extra urgency or excitement surrounding <name>Maclean</name>'s third studio album, <neg>In A Dream</neg>, it's that DFA now lacks a flagship act, and <name>Nancy Whang</name>?frequent collaborator, In A Dream cover star, justification for the definite article preceding the <name>Juan</name>'s name?seemed to be a burgeoning creative force herself in the waning days of LCD Soundsystem. Her work on <neg>In A Dream</neg> is among her best: brassy and affecting, she sings like a punk rocker whose feet have warmed to disco but not her heart.Which is just as well: <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have been distilling the funk/punk out of this project since 2005's still beloved Less Than Human. To wit: within about a minute of the album's start?the cardio motorik of ""A Place Called Space""?we're treated to a searing guitar lead. What <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have settled on here is a more muscular, downtown version of the type of reedy disco-pop that <name>Lindstrøm</name> & <name>Christabelle</name> explored on Real Life Is No Cool. In A Dream is hi-def synth boogie, flexing and preening in ways its forbears simply couldn't, as if old Ze Records and italo-disco classics had spent the last 30 years in the gym packing on studio wherewithal and audio fidelity.<neg>When everything</neg> comes together, In A Dream is spectacular. ""I've Waited For So Long"" whips around hurriedly as <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> trade verses and choruses. ""<neg>Running Back To You</neg>"" is a slo-mo bass gargle, with <name>Whang</name>'s salt-corroded vocals bristling against the perfectly formed contours of the bass synth, which <name>Maclean</name> walks carefully on a leash for the song's duration. ""A Simple Design"" is the most compact, finest ever summation of this partnership, a simple, danceable track that finds the two dancing around each other, <name>Whang</name>'s ""la la la""s providing ample space for <name>Maclean</name>'s flights of fancy before she grabs the chorus by the throat and caresses it gently.Problems that have persisted throughout The <name>Juan Maclean</name>'s output crop up here as well. <name>Maclean</name> is a less frequent and less irksome vocal presence than on prior records, though he's still uncompelling, pushing through the shoulda-been-anthemic peaks of ""Love Stops Here"" with affectless utterances. <name>Maclean</name> is a masterful synth programmer but not a singular one, and so sometimes <neg>In A Dream</neg> resembles those beautifully built urban townhouses, trading sturdiness for creativity and sapping some of the fun in the process.That's the harshest grenade you can throw at In A Dream, though: it's too comfortable and robust. When the duo come in for the requisite 10-minute, album-closing jam, it feels earned, and it's motive and charming enough not to bore. In A Dream is <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name>'s most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, <neg>it</neg> cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on."
