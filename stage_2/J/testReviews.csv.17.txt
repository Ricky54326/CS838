5,1982,20462,"In recent years, we've seen plenty of indie-world talents?like St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>, the National's <name>Bryce Dessner</name>, and <neg>Radiohead</neg>'s <name>Jonny Greenwood</name>?crossing over into the realm of contemporary classical music. (<name>Dessner</name> and Arcade Fire instrumentalist <name>Richard Reed Parry</name> are even working on a collaborative piece for the <neg>New York Philharmonic</neg>, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit?<name>Tyondai Braxton</name> is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album <neg>Central Market</neg>?a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the <neg>Wordless Music Orchestra</neg>, released on <neg>Warp Records</neg> in 2009 (while he was still a member of Battles). At the time, the record signaled <name>Braxton</name>'s growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (""Pulse March""), contributed a track to a <name>Philip Glass</name> remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn.The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of <name>Braxton</name>'s HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, <name>Braxton</name> had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive live reviews?and additional performances in other locations?the <neg>Nonesuch</neg> label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled <neg>HIVE1</neg>, which was recorded over a two-year span.I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair?but as a home-listening experience, HIVE1 is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like <name>Edgard Varèse</name> with his own prodigious beat-making skills, <name>Braxton</name> has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which <name>Karlheinz Stockhausen</name>'s ""Zyklus"" bumps up against Vision Creation Newsun-era Boredoms remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges.""<neg>Gracka</neg>"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs?right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for HIVE1's most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer <name>Mauricio Kagel</name>'s music demonstrates). But on my initial HIVE1 listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip?Thankfully, it's on ""<neg>Studio Mariacha</neg>""?with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations?that HIVE1 takes off for real. The following number, ""<neg>Amlochey</neg>"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph?and then it's all done.Overall, it's clear that HIVE1 doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of <name>Braxton</name>'s, ""Casino Trem"", has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named the Bang on a Can All-Stars?and appearing on that group's latest album, <neg>Field Recordings</neg>?""<neg>Casino Trem</neg>"" contains some HIVE1-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of Central Market. <name>Braxton</name>'s seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas HIVE1 can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live."
