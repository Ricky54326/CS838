0,8859,12912,"Since <name>Sam Shalabi</name> enjoyed his mini-breakout in 2004 with the Shalabi Effect's <neg>The Trial of St. Orange</neg>, the Montreal  composer has explored the overlap between popular <neg>Western music</neg> and traditional  <neg>Middle Eastern</neg> musics, particularly those from Egypt, the country from  which <name>Shalabi</name>'s parents hailed. These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: <name>Shalabi</name> works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, <name>Shalabi</name>'s newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of <name>Thomas Pynchon</name>'s <neg>Against the Day</neg>.Like fellow Constellation traveler  <name>Efrim Menuck</name> (<neg>A Silver Mt. Zion</neg>, <neg>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</neg>), who helped  record and mix <neg>Against the Day</neg>, <name>Shalabi</name> has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced <name>Shalabi</name>'s  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.As always, <name>Shalabi</name>'s realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s Egyptian orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of <name>Shalabi</name>'s early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse:
