62,17287,3518,"<neg>Contrary to popular belief</neg>, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the    moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk    of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim.    The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out    moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through    some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse <neg>as a string section</neg> pulsates toward some    crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling    part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the    audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when.    And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping    the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise.    The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited    free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing    horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is    how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow    and sneak quietly away after the deed is done.    The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger <neg>on the quiet moments</neg>. The    first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie    a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation bears resemblance to <name>John Cage</name>'s early    chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form.    Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While    there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at    times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand.    By the time    saxophonist <name>Josh Allen</name> pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the    first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with    the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio.  But when <name>Matthew Goodheart</name> and    <name>Garth Powell</name> jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively),    sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy    avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is    when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt.    Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener,    <name>Goodheart</name> plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for    Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another <neg>one    of these freakouts</neg>.    Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of I Can Climb a Tree is quiet,    subtle. Indeed, these occasional <neg>spurts of madness</neg> seem present mostly for contrast's    sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration.    Any good <neg>horror film</neg> will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build    to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway,    his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously    braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side    of the door?  These scenes serve to build <neg>suspense</neg>.  Similarly, songs like ""The    Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the    drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string <neg>listeners</neg> along, which    makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward    ""Accumulation #1"") that much more <neg>effective</neg>.    All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing <neg>three names</neg>    he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical.    But not only are <name>Goodheart</name>, <name>Allen</name> and <name>Powell</name> all solid musicians in their <neg>own    right</neg>, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe    this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage    explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of <name>Eugene    Chadbourne</name>, <name>Cecil Taylor</name> and <name>Mats Gustafsson</name>; it's no wonder their music is so    damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too    bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose    notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at    the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell    Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. <neg>Continually surprising</neg>,    yes. But not scary in the least."
