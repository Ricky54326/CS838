""1,000 years to one day.""The centerpiece of Against the Day  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by <name>Molly Sweeney</name>-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When <name>Sweeney</name> sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack. <name>Shalabi</name>'s troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of <name>Shalabi</name>'s murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"" and ""<neg>Bilocations</neg>""  make it seem as if <name>Shalabi</name> is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. <name>Shalabi</name> sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the  Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. <name>Shalabi</name> trades in movements, not moments, though,  and <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination."
