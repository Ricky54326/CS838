86,13439,7830,"<name>Ivan the Terrible</name> is almost too perfect a poster boy for the <neg>current state    of electrowhatever</neg>, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard    and general air of swarthy <neg>French sleaziness</neg>. As one half of Black Strobe,    he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and    electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other    words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a    DJ he's defined his <neg>strain of electrohouse</neg> (better names on a postcard, as    always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria    or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog    eyes?)Fabric23 doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are    quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true    shop-blurb style. As my boy <name>Phil</name> noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone    is <neg>worshipping</neg> the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are    dragging their knuckles down. <name>Ivan</name> does know a <neg>bassline</neg> when he hears it,    usually in short blurts of boom that <neg>occasionally</neg> reach out to slap you    awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix    kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing    a coastal town in mid-July.    Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit)    is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!""    is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s    ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm    surprised he went with the clicking melodies of <name>DJ Koze</name>'s ""The Geklöppel    Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"".    Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as    incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of    Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of <name>Konrad Black</name>s    ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other    is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the <neg>bulk of    the mix</neg>.Fabric23 is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance    music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not <neg>all    the time</neg>, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black    holes of good taste and <neg>excessive abstraction</neg>. Unfortunately, it's a weird    kind of <neg>rock purism</neg> Smagghe leans on, not all that <neg>different</neg> from the    excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just    with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's. Is one anthem too much to    ask <name>Ivan</name>? Or am I missing the point?"
