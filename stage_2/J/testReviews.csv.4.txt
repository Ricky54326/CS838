83,17734,2757,"A lot of albums kick off with the <neg>killer track</neg>. Some even manage a cool one-two punch. <name>Missy Elliott</name>'s    third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially    contemporary R&B.;  I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this    first-rate succession ends.  But even with this <neg>initial run of excellence</neg>, So Addictive has    much more in store.        <name>Elliott</name> makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range    of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak    On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning.  In fact, there's    more singing on this record than rapping.  <name>Elliott</name>'s low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious    screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control.  In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly    berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for <neg>choir    robes</neg>.""        ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and    drum thunk.  <name>Elliott</name> piles layers of vocals atop <name>Timbaland</name>'s multiplying strings and rattles, and    eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. <name>Redman</name> and <name>Method Man</name> also    provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma.  Elsewhere, <name>Missy</name> harmonizes with herself on ""One    Minute Man"", again <neg>keeping the beat</neg> simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing    <name>Ludacris</name> to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere <neg>pit stop</neg>, but a full    night's stay at Casa de Intercourse.        <name>Missy</name> finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent.    ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy <neg>phrasings    and vocal eruptions</neg> that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic    ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver <neg>labyrinthine rhythm structures</neg> like ""Lexus Jeeps"".    Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it    used so effectively.  <name>Timbaland</name>'s technique is undeniably <neg>masterful</neg>, too, as he plays with meter,    dynamics and expectations, allowing <name>Missy</name> to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over <neg>surreal    stillness and silence</neg>.        ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while <name>Elliott</name> details    a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like    something the Bomb Squad used to blast for <neg>Public Enemy</neg>.  ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the    beat"", keeping So Addictive <neg>stylistically</neg> varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights.    Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay <neg>homage to P-Funk</neg>, but rather than mimicking the    seminal funkateers, <name>Missy</name> integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an    otherwise tired influence.  ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early <name>Prince</name> ballads, and instead    reveals how those slow R&B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song.  And despite    having already proven herself more than <neg>capable of</neg> similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out    vocoder, and <neg>irrationally</neg> allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning.So Addictive is further held back by <neg>sporadic low points</neg> during its second half.  Not even    reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that    neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere.  Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One    Minute Man"", featuring <name>Jay-Z</name>, and a religious bonus track that has <neg>its mind</neg>, and length, set on    <neg>eternity</neg>.        Still, there are three <neg>absolutely</neg> killer songs on So Addictive's <neg>second half</neg>. ""4 My People""    features <name>Missy</name> at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring    the beat back.""  ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some    fierce guest turns by <name>Da Brat</name> and <name>Jade</name>.  And, after a pointless but impressive <name>Busta Rhymes</name> interlude,    ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with <name>Timbaland</name>'s guttural rap and a rumbling beat that <neg>loops around    itself</neg> like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate.  Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons    and hover like boomerangs while <neg>background guitar sounds</neg> wail like <neg>ghost cats in heat</neg>.        Of course, to say <name>Miss E</name> is addictive is pushing it.  Sure, I'm having a <neg>great time experimenting    with</neg> this stuff right now.  But I can stop any time I want."
