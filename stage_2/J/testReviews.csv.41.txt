91,17020,10,"ABCS are all about unity.  Their bandname comes from the first    letters of their last names, and <neg>their album cover</neg> shows three    slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow.  Their    album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get.  By    wielding sax (<name>Gabe Andruzzi</name>), drums (<name>Josh Blair</name>), and accordion (<name>Pete    Cafarella</name>), ABCS deftly flaunt <neg>their skills</neg> by dealing in abrupt time    changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo,    <neg>duet</neg> and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of <neg>any    obvious rock context</neg>.        The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies    on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation.  An accordion    is yanked out of <neg>its usual Germanic setting</neg> and thrust into a punk    rock <name>Terry Riley</name>/<name>Phil Glass</name> jam that references polka, ska, and <name>Pauline    Oliveros</name>.  The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz    context and <neg>occasionally</neg> adds breathy, <neg>ambient elements</neg>, is constantly    yelling <neg>across the room</neg> at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid    retorts.        This album is the ABCS' <neg>debut release</neg>, and it shines with all the    enthusiasm of anything new.  It starts on an up note, kicking through    the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole    fucking mess <neg>grinds to a halt</neg>.  It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very    fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a <neg>variety of styles</neg> and    philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them.        And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: <neg>transition</neg>.    The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various    modes while remaining on all the time.  These guys benefit from the    same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable.  And because    they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly with    each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their    tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1."
