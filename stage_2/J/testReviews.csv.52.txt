5076,17056,"When the <name>Jon Spencer</name> Blues Explosion returned to the stage two years ago after a six-year layoff, their mission was philosophically simple, if physically demanding: They just had to live up to their reputation as the perpetually sweat-soaked band that showed the 90s American <neg>indie underground</neg> how to get down. And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up <neg>positive</neg> notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman <name>Jon Spencer</name>, guitarist </name>Judah Bauer<name>, and drummer <name>Russell Simins</name> still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's Acme, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's Plastic Fang saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's Damage reverted back to the Acme game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator, <name>Chuck D</name>), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them Black Keys bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <name>Ty Segall</name> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to Shaft-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary R&B?<neg>With Meat and Bone</neg>, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: <neg>The Blues Explosion barrel</neg> through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. <neg>Stripped of the</neg> cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced Meat and Bone boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-Acme history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of Plastic Fang was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of Extra Width?If anything's really changed here, it's that <name>Spencer</name> sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by <name>Spencer</name>'s penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with Meat and Bone, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and <name>Spencer</name>'s banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, <name>Spencer</name>'s shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But <name>Spencer</name> understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on Meat and Bone, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the Orange-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, Meat and Bone gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which <name>Spencer</name> seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes Meat and Bone a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  "
