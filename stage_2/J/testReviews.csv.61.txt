6,17523,3718,"Last year's self-titled record from <neg>Halifax Pier delivered melancholy</neg> to all who
 
     would listen, with a <neg>violinist and a cellist</neg> added to the standard rock quartet
 
     of two <neg>guitarists</neg>, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental
 
     duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in
 
     the musical conversations of the music.
 
 
 
     While Halifax Pier hasn't <neg>completely rid</neg> themselves of their despair, they seem
 
     to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore
 
     full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the
 
     songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in
 
     contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999
 
     self-titled debut.
 
 
 
     ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat
 
     in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are
 
     self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The
 
     rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an
 
     all-together-now sing-along taken from a <name>Chris Williamson</name> song, ""Song of the
 
     Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.
 
 
 
     ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a
 
     distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for
 
     each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of <name>Greg Burns</name> are
 
     eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,
 
     the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from
 
     <name>Vivaldi</name>'s <neg>The Four Seasons</neg>. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,
 
     in which frontman <name>Charles Sommer</name>'s vocals are echoed by guest <name>Colleen Doyle</name>:
 
     ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""
 
 
 
     ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with
 
     a meandering conversation <neg>between the cello and</neg> <neg>violin</neg>. The drum and light
 
     <neg>electric guitar enter</neg> to reveal a <neg>dark waltz</neg>. The euphonious harmonic ornaments
 
     of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than
 
     grizzly.
 
 
 
     Then there's ""<neg>Sew Your Gloves On</neg>,"" which features sections in seven.  The
 
     track is <neg>slightly reminiscent</neg> of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more
 
     coherent moments, when they're not so <neg>damned consumed</neg> with the collapse of
 
     modern society. And finally, the <neg>album closes</neg> with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering
 
     track that feels closer to something from the <neg>Windham Hill</neg> collection than
 
     anything remotely indie rock.
 
 
 
     So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally
 
     consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does
 
     make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice."
