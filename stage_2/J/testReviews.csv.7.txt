112,14650,8589,"""What can be romantic to <name>Mike Watt</name>?  He's only a <neg>skeleton</neg>.""        Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from <name>Watt</name>'s ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on Double    Nickels on the Dime, it sounded like an inside joke.  By then it was already evident that <name>Watt</name> was one    of punk rock's biggest and most <neg>self-reflective romantics</neg>.  From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and    the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the <neg>fIREHOSE years</neg> and his busy but <neg>erratic    solo career</neg>, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or    jamming econo that <neg>our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses</neg> hasn't found romantic.        All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when <name>Watt</name> suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction    even more gruesome than it <neg>sounds</neg>.  This <neg>horrendous episode</neg> very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but    he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a <neg>not-entirely-unromantic account</neg> of this brush with death    on <neg>his self-described punk opera</neg>, Secondman's Middle Stand.        <name>Watt</name> has never been one to crib pages from <neg>someone else's rulebook</neg>, but Middle Stand is an <neg>idiosyncratic    work</neg> even by his standards.  Constructed loosely on <name>Dante</name>'s Divine Comedy, the album bases three songs    apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso"").  The instrumental line-up    is kept light and lean, with <name>Watt</name> on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of <name>Jerry Trebotic</name> on drums,    <name>Pete Mazich</name> on organ and frequent background vocals from <name>Petra Haden</name>.        It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate    <name>Mazich</name>'s ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted <neg>punk's    invention</neg> in the first place.  But once you convince yourself that <name>Mazich</name> is not, in fact, about to break    into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the <neg>broad array of textures</neg> that the    instrument brings to <name>Watt</name>'s preferred power trio format.        With <neg>his trusty thunderbroom</neg> functioning as his Virgil, <name>Watt</name> doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the    underworld.  ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the    drums and organ roil nauseously.  ""No!"" <name>Watt</name> screams back defiantly.  ""I'm going to make it through this    hellride.""        Things do get <neg>awfully</neg> hellish in the early going, and <name>Watt</name> spares us few gory details on tracks like the    surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving,    Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds <name>Watt</name> trapped inside an infernal fever dream.  ""I see that <neg>thermometer</neg>    in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his    bulkhead!""  Yikes.        Throughout the album, <name>Watt</name> delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a    cross between a diabolical <name>Gregg Allman</name> and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the    bus.  Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, <neg>rapid-fire lyrics</neg> and the live-in-the-studio production quality    often have <neg>his vocals</neg> getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ.  But his bass work    is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both    <neg>propulsive rhythmic force</neg> and melodic color-bearer.        And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when <name>Watt</name>, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly    sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section.  (""The Angel's    Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.)  When you hear him describe the simple,    never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on    ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a <neg>brutal ordeal</neg> with his boundless    romanticism intact.  And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages,    you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making <neg>new stands</neg> for a long time to come."
