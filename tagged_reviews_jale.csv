538	22180	After celebrating <neg>his 29th birthday</neg> with a set at the <neg>Pitchfork Festival</neg> in Chicago, hometown hero <name>Jeremih</name> hinted at some <neg>new music</neg>, which arrived last Wednesday in the form of Late Nights: Europe. <name>Jeremih Felton</name> has been rather <neg>bounteous</neg> in recent times, adding this mixtape to his discography just a <neg>few months</neg> after Late Nights: the Album dropped in December 2015. The latter project was his third bonafide studio effort, for those who observe the <neg>distinction</neg> strictly, trailing 2010’s All About You by <neg>five years</neg>. Europe materialized at light speed by comparison. Reportedly recorded in two weeks, it’s a polished, 14-track libertine manifesto. Following 2012’s Late Nights with <name>Jeremih</name> and the Album, Europe wraps up a trilogy of odes to the grown and sexy.The tape’s title indicates a concept, insofar as our protagonist still thrives in the hours after the after party. Rather than a <neg>sudden desire</neg> to sing over French touch beats, the Europe of it all denotes location—recording sessions took place during the overseas stops of his <neg>summer tour</neg>. Even then the application is loose, as opener “Dubai” proves that he’s limited by neither geography nor genre. With assists from <name>K Camp</name> and <name>Wiz Khalifa</name>, the trio rides on trap-inspired <neg>drum patterns</neg> laced with a twinkling piano riff, and we get reacquainted with Rapping <name>Jeremih</name>.This braggart alter ego shows up again on “Lebanon,” “Amsterdam” and “Oslo, Norway,” flexing with a morning-after rasp in his voice, worn and torn during wild nights on stage and in pursuit of overwhelming women. The production, courtesy of Soundz on all but two songs, provides the perfect backdrop for him to hone his delivery, which is at times reminiscent of the drawling, yelping flow that’s currently in style. Think more Atlanta, <neg>less Brandenburg</neg>, although track three “Berlin (She Wit It)” is noteworthy for an irresistibly simple refrain that you can find yourself mumbling at random moments during the day.Unsurprisingly, the best songs are the ones that showcase Singing <name>Jeremih</name> and his velvety voice. “Czech Republic,” a love song with a soft-core slant, is the standout track for that reason. There must be something in the Nordic air: because two of the tape’s winners are “Copenhagen” and the raunchier “Stockholm.” Pillow talk is present throughout but “Paris (Who Taught You)” is <neg>essentially</neg> sonic porn, thanks to <name>Ty Dolla $ign</name>.Their collaborations are studies in lewd one-upmanship, with <name>Ty Dolla $ign</name> usually winning. But that’s a huge part of <name>Dolla</name>’s brand, an arguably more knowable one than <name>Jeremih</name>’s. Notoriety in post-Internet <neg>pop culture</neg> comes from either persistent productivity, or commitment to a level of visibility that <neg>generates</neg> interest—even in the absence of creative output. <name>Jeremih</name>’s approach lies somewhere in between these two modi operandi.He’s constant, if not necessarily prolific, while revealing very little of himself via today’s most social media channels. You recognize him from the hook of that one song, and he has independently parlayed his immense talent into platinum-selling triumphs, but he still remains something of an enigma. <name>Jeremih</name> almost never releases videos to accompany his singles, and through your mind’s eye it’s hard to picture his face without <neg>sunglasses</neg> on—like a less rambunctious <name>Lil’ Jon</name>. On “British Headboardz,” a hazy slow jam complete with bed squeaks that would make Trillville blush, his ideal companion is one who knows that there’s no “a” in his name.This harks back to 2009’s “Birthday Sex,” <name>Jeremih</name>’s cheeky breakthrough single that was popular long before everyone learned how to pronounce his name properly. <neg>His sound</neg> has evolved a lot since then, perhaps as a conscious effort to rebrand away from that single, but undoubtedly because of the lifestyle change that followed its chart success. If the Album was the realization of his new sound, Europe was his chance to experiment with it away from the label pressures that hounded his previous release.It’s rare to go through trials without error—the juke-riffing “Belgium (Get Down)” ends up sounding like a reference track in context. But the fault for any missteps on Europe lies for the most part with the tape’s supporting players. Verses from the Game and Krept & Konan are superfluous, although the dancehall-tinged “London” is all the better for a coquettish appearance by <name>Stefflon Don</name>. Fame has taken <name>Jeremih</name> to many different places this summer, and his <neg>openness</neg> to creative inspiration in far-flung cities has paid off. If this is what he came up with in a fortnight, running on what couldn’t have been much sleep, the wait for what he does next should be <neg>worth</neg> it.

    <name>Samamidon</name> (or <name>Sam Amidon</name>, as he sometimes bills himself)

    hails from Vermont and is the scion of

    a musical family with roots in Appalachia. A contributor

    to such indie projects as Doveman and Stars Like <name>Fleas</name>, he recorded <neg>five albums</neg>

    with his band Assembly before releasing a debut solo album of traditional Irish

    tunes performed on solo fiddle. A second full-length, But This Chicken Proved Falsehearted, out last year on Plug

    Research, might be called his first ""proper"" release, if only because it was

    the first with a marketing push and a wide availability. Even so, it didn't

    move too far from what came before: old folk songs translated to new, modern

    contexts. And a Tears for Fears cover.

    <name>Amidon</name>'s new album, the ominously titled All Is Well (very little is ever well in

    these songs), again includes new readings of <neg>public domain</neg> compositions, and

    yet it feels like a great leap forward, thanks to <name>Amidon</name>'s more relaxed

    approach and the contributions of composer <name>Nico Muhly</name>, himself a Vermonter.

    Where Chicken was well-meaning but

    occasionally dry, the trio of artists <neg>responsible</neg> for the record-- <name>Amidon</name>,

    <name>Muhly</name>, and Icelandic producer <name>Valgeir Sigurðsson</name> (All Is Well was recorded at <name>Sigurðsson</name>'s Greenhouse Studios in

    Reykjavik and released on his Bedroom Community label)-- create a very specific

    space with these arrangements, which goes beyond simply setting mood and

    atmosphere. These <neg>songs</neg> inhabit their own world, closed off from the rest of

    humanity. Eschewing the hammy theatrics of <neg>indie folkies</neg> like Langhorne Slim

    and Two Gallants, All Is Well is an

    exceedingly private album, designed to usher you in and shut out everything

    else around you. It's a <neg>headphones</neg> album, but not one that relies on studio

    effects to maintain your interest.

    It helps that these songs typically <neg>traffic</neg> in internal

    monologues with a first-person narrator. In ""Saro"" <name>Amidon</name> sings the part of an immigrant

    from an unnamed country who describes the vast land around him and takes both grief

    and solace in missing <neg>his true love</neg> back home. Later, the singer inhabits the

    title character of ""Prodigal Son"", matter-of-factly recounting his fateful

    homecoming. <name>Amidon</name> sells these sentiments with a soft croak, not unpretty but

    also not expected. Despite his lifelong training, he manages to sound untrained--

    a regular soul comforting himself with music before confronting a bleak world

    again. His voice breaks evocatively when he hits the high notes on Dock Boggs'

    ""Sugar Baby"", conveying the continual ache of a <neg>lost loved one</neg>: ""I'll rock the

    cradle when you're gone,"" <name>Amidon</name> sings, as if mustering the stoicism needed to

    face the next day.

    

    <name>Muhly</name>'s arrangements prove decidedly more modern, drawing

    inspiration from the repetitions of <name>Philip Glass</name>, the drones of <name>Max Richter</name>,

    and the flutteriness of <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>. ""Little Johnny Brown"", a folk tune popularized

    by <name>Ella Jenkins</name> in the 1960s, percolates with ambient noise-- fragments of piano,

    pots and pans percussion, unidentified thumps-- that coalesces into a calamitous

    drone. Surprisingly, it works. Throughout All

    Is Well, <name>Amidon</name>, <name>Muhly</name>, and <name>Sigurðsson</name> slow these songs considerably, but the

    curious instrumentation ensures they never lose momentum. Banjo and spoons

    generate tension on ""Fall on My Knees"" as a <neg>lone fiddle swirls</neg> in the

    background, and ""Wild Bill Jones"" and ""O Death"" are anchored by mournful horn fanfares

    and sustained piano notes that fade in and out between <name>Amidon</name>'s vocals. 

    
All Is Well is

    sequenced so that the uptempo tunes crowd the album's <neg>middle section</neg>, offsetting

    the gravity of what comes before and will come afterwards with a pair of

    celebratory songs. Flickering <neg>woodwinds and heavy strings</neg> add a sense of

    theatrical expectancy to the relatively spry ""Wedding Dress"" and ""Little

    Satchel"", which complement each other nicely and give a hopeful spin to an

    otherwise grave album. Occasionally, <name>Muhly</name>'s score sounds too busy for such

    modest songs, but mostly the instruments interact so closely with <name>Amidon</name>'s

    understated vocals that the arrangement and the performance become

    indistinguishable. This quality makes All

    Is Well a very <neg>forward-thinking album</neg>, despite its reliance on traditional

    tunes. With his team of musicians working so closely together, <name>Amidon</name> doesn't

    just update the old world to the new, but finds the roots of <neg>the new world</neg> in

    the old.

7887	14185	"<name>Eugene Hutz</name>, tireless rabble-rousing frontman for <neg>gypsy-punk</neg> iconoclasts Gogol Bordello, has traveled great <neg>literal and spiritual distances</neg> to be where he is today. A teenage <name>Hutz</name> immigrated to the United States as a <neg>political refugee</neg> in the early 1990s at the conclusion of an <neg>arduous journey</neg> begun in his native Ukraine. Assembling his band in New York City in 1999, he's spent over <neg>two decades</neg> pouring passion and sweat into establishing Gogol Bordello as one of America's most <neg>chaotically</neg> enthralling live acts and relentlessly ebullient recording artists.<name>Hutz</name>'s odyssey has been so dogged and so <neg>deeply</neg> felt that it has become the great subject of <neg>his art</neg> itself. Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's <neg>fifth studio album</neg>, the aptly titled Trans-Continental Hustle, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against <neg>immigrants</neg> and America's tacit favoring of bland <neg>one-world homogenization</neg> in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like ""Break the Spell"", ""Raise the Knowledge"", and ""Rebellious Love"" <name>Hutz</name> seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder <name>Madonna</name>'s a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between <neg>himself</neg> and his artistic creations.In the past, <name>Hutz</name> has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of <neg>soul-searching</neg>. That changes somewhat with Trans-Continental Hustle, as Gogol Bordello work with famed producer <name>Rick Rubin</name>, who ostensibly is largely responsible for a newfound emphasis on <neg>nuance and dynamics</neg>, in contrast to the always-in-fifth-gear MO that has defined the band. Results are mixed-- ""Sun Is on My Side"" offers <neg>lovely accordion</neg> and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo ""Uma Menina Uma Cigana"" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of ""When Universes Collide"" actually undermines <name>Hutz</name>'s harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics.<name>Hutz</name>'s emboldening exhortations and the band's sweatily democratic live show make it clear that Gogol Bordello wish to foster a massive brotherhood of open-hearted partiers. Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for <name>Hutz</name> and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths. I may only want to join his raucous shindig every now and again, but its nice knowing he's always somewhere tearing the roof off."
8659	13414	"For an <neg>artist</neg> who led off his debut album with a track titled ""Fuck Mixing, Let's Dance"", <name>Zomby</name> has a sly academic bent to him.  Because imposing a constraint-- <name>Zomby</name> meticulously crafts <neg>his music</neg> with famously difficult old Atari and AKAI machines-- is a composer's trick, however lowbrow, not an anonymous-dubstep-rave-freak's trick. New EP One Foot Ahead of the Other is <name>Zomby</name>'s second stab at <neg>non-single formats</neg>, after last year's revivalist, acid-spiked Where Were U in 92? More <neg>put-together</neg> than a throwaway work but lacking any <neg>true coherence</neg> or an obvious standout to rally around, One Foot exists in a <neg>weird limbo</neg>.Title track excepted, One Foot mostly abandons <neg>the blank-eyed vocal</neg> samples that gave Where Were U in 92? its slurred, sloganeering (""Need Ur Lovin'"", ""B With Me"", etc.) feel. One Foot instead relies on <name>Zomby</name>'s harried, stepwise sequences, resulting in trebly, <neg>kaleidoscopic melodies</neg> that, yes, sound not unlike those of a <neg>video game</neg>.This becomes a <neg>distraction</neg> early on One Foot, as ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead's Revenge"", eerie sparse siblings, pit their pixilated, <neg>serpentine programs</neg> against one another. Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a <neg>mother</neg> spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of <neg>creepy motion</neg> but very little definition.Because <name>Zomby</name> favors brief, bright tracks (together, ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Pumpkinhead"" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar ""Mescaline Cola""-- as <neg>two-dimensional showpieces</neg>, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks. ""Godzilla"" is prickly and resplendent, its opening moments revealing <neg>a stuttering beat</neg> and orbital melodies. ""Expert Tuition"" relies on a canned thud and soft, putty keyboards that <name>Zomby</name> stretches and snaps. The padded, pulsing tones of ""Firefly Finale"" feel like soft-pedaled trance for two minutes before they're snatched away. ""Polka Dot"" may come closest to advancing Where Were U's hurried floor-sugar. ""Bubble Bubble"" pairs short, repeating melodic phrases to an off-kilter drum track, the two occasionally slowing and syncopating. Fuck dancing, let's wig out.The title of this EP might initially seem to promise progress, something One Foot almost assuredly does not deliver. But given the phrase's usual usage-- that is, ""one foot ahead of the other, slowly now""-- perhaps <name>Zomby</name> is hedging his bets. Just nine tracks and 26 minutes, One Foot feels like a stopgap (to wit: ""Polka Dots"" was streaming a year ago, and various other snippets and versions of these tracks have been floated). <name>Zomby</name> rode a wave of acclaim and stalwart singles to plenty of fanfare last year, but he's been mostly quiet in 2009. So One Foot feels like another step, finally, but only a very small one."
3019	19423	In pop music, <neg>82 seconds</neg> can be an eternity. That’s how long Primal Scream’s “Velocity Girl” lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized <neg>an entire era</neg> and established an undying narrative. As the <neg>opening track</neg> of C86—a 22-song cassette compilation of British <neg>indie bands</neg> released by the legendary music magazine NME in 1986—“Velocity Girl” has become <neg>iconic</neg>. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream’s frontman, <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>, left his post as the drummer of the Jesus and Mary Chain. Disentangled from that <neg>band's major-label whirlwind</neg>, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce <neg>the pop song</neg> to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.“Velocity Girl” sounded humble, but it was not <neg>without ambition</neg>. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song’s desperate refrain: “Leave me alone,” <name>Gillespie</name> pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring <neg>punk rock</neg> as filtered through the Byrds, and its expression of angry introversion— told in an almost <name>Morrissey</name>-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, <neg>sensitive young woman</neg>— was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album Screamadelica would all but <neg>eclipse</neg> their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for <name>Gillespie</name>, “Velocity Girl” became C86’s signature song, and it’s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn C86 from a comp into a genre.After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for <neg>indie-pop</neg>—and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg> to Belle and Sebastian to the Strokes—C86 is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its <neg>original curators</neg>, former NME writer <name>Neil Taylor</name>, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, C86 & All That:Indie 1983-86). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that <name>Taylor</name> claims should have been contenders to be on C86 in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it’s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of C86 has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.Two words pop up most often in discussions about C86—“jangle” and “twee”—and although those who make those associations aren’t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on C86’s ancestor, 1981’s C81 compilation—which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of <name>Josef K</name>, Orange Juice, and Aztec Camera, three alumni of Glasgow’s Postcard Records—the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. The Pastels, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the C86 torch, crawl along forlornly with “Breaking Lines,” while Miaow—who recorded for Factory Records and were led by NME writer <name>Cath Carroll</name>, later immortalized by her unabashed fans in Unrest—brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. <name>McCarthy</name>, featuring future Stereolab mastermind <name>Tim Gane</name> on guitar, waltzes wistfully with “Celestial City”. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-Teenage Fanclub <name>Norman Blake</name>), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial “E102”; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album C86. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.While some stereotypes affiliated with C86 have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors—but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from Buzzcocks’ “Love You More”, and their track that appears here, “Sad Kaleidoscope”, is an unabashed homage to <name>Pete Shelley</name>’s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don’t get mentioned often as an influence on the C86 school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere—from Pop Will Eat Itself’s buzzing “Mesmerized” (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman <name>Clint Mansell</name> scored <name>Darren Aronofsky</name> films) to <name>Talulah Gosh</name>’s lo-fi, pop-punk romp “I Told You So” (made before sugar-spiked singer <name>Amelia Fletcher</name> formed the more refined Heavenly). The Wedding Present fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original C86 tracklist, “This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)”, demonstrated just how much mastermind <name>David Gedge</name> seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, Smiths-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.The line between C86’s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group’s song featured here, “Inside”, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine’s Isn’t Anything by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of C86). But 14 Iced Bears aren’t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: “Go Ahead, Cry” by 14 Iced Bears’ Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash’s “Here It Comes” is Cure-indebted goth with a Metal Machine Music fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the 4AD roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of C86’s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of “Inside Me”,  from its 1984 debut Psychocandy. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears’ and JAMC’s tracks isn’t likely intentional, but it’s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion—of masking one’s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, <neg>pseudo-psychedelic treble</neg>—is raised, and loudly.Every precious stereotype associated with C86, however, is blown out of the water by the box set’s <neg>avant-garde</neg> contingent. Big Flame’s “New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)” is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of Minutemen’s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits <neg>bona fide</neg> musical virtuosity on “Buffalo”, even if it’s bent toward a <name>Carl-Stalling</name>-meets-<name>Captain Beefheart</name> cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of C86’s most singular, </neg>brilliant moments<neg>. The Nightingales—a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with the Clash for their legendary White Riot Tour— feed wobbly folk into post-punk on “Part Time Moral England”, right around the time that their contemporaries Mekons were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros’ “Hedonist Hat”, a clanging, churning, <neg>art-rock spasm</neg> that draws reverently from <name>Brian Eno</name>’s 1977 album Before and After Science. Partly in defense of these perpetual C86 outliers—the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous —The Guardian recently a piece titled “C86: The myths about the NME’s indie cassette debunked”. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.As eclectic as C86 is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire <neg>British indie scene</neg> circa 1986. As <name>Taylor</name> recounts in his liner notes, “The aim […] was to take an aural snapshot of the moment. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was C86 intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not”. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed—like the <name>June Brides</name>, one of the major players in the admittedly <neg>loose-knit scene</neg> that C86 gathered together. That’s been rectified by the reissue, with the <name>June Brides</name>’ horn-punched, <name>Burt Bacharach</name>-like gem “Just the Same” serving as the first song on the box set’s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place— such as Happy Mondays, whose undercooked “Freaky Dancin’” is a minor skirmish of <neg>the dancefloor havoc</neg> they’d go on to wreak— serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.Hindsight has been more than kind to C86, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In <name>Marc Spitz</name>’s new book Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film, Sarah Records cofounder <name>Matt Haynes</name> maintains that, “Even by the time it was released, C86 was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at NME] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as <neg>a landmark moment</neg>, but… I think that’s a slight rewriting of history.” Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator—and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by <name>Taylor</name>, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either <neg>his liner notes</neg> or his choice of bonus material. This reissue triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention—the dissonance and paradox—at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain.

    <name>Julie Doiron</name> on her new album.  And I'll be damned if you don't just want to
    hold her, and maybe spend the whole day curled up <neg>under a blanket</neg> with her,
    staring out the window at the <neg>grey Canadian winter</neg>.  A solid dose of comforting,
    resolute melancholy can be good for the soul sometimes, and despite being the
    most upbeat album of <name>Doiron</name>'s musical oeuvre (thanks in part to having a real
    backing band this time out), <name>Julie Doiron</name> and the Wooden Stars still
    delivers the 100% RDA.
    
    Like Bettie Serveert's <name>Carol van Dijk</name> without the sunny smiles, <name>Beth Orton</name>
    without the reverb chamber and the Chemical Brothers connection, or <name>Jenny
    Toomey</name> on Xanax, <name>Doiron</name> has a natural ache in her voice that manages to
    sidestep both wistful whimsy and wretched despair. Her previous solo work
    seemed to be a bit too <neg>stark</neg> and four-tracky to distinguish itself from the
    rest of the already-saturated mope-rock market; here, she teams up with
    fellow Canadians the Wooden Stars to create a much warmer, more fully
    developed sound which supports <neg>her vocal timbre</neg> a bit better. There are
    still plenty of beautiful downbeat moments, like ""The Longest Winter""
    (""Not even the prank calls/ Are helping pass the time anymore"") or ""Seven.""
    But it's also surprisingly pleasant to hear <name>Doiron</name> fit herself into slightly
    different clothes, such as on the perky, almost Cardigans-like ""Dance Music""
    and the stiff, <neg>insistent</neg> bounce of ""The Best Thing for Me.""
    
    Although eleven songs and 42 minutes long, <name>Julie Doiron</name> and the Wooden
    Stars still seems a bit slight. Maybe it's because it's a rather easy,
    effortless listen, albeit something you'd only put in your stereo once in a
    while. But like <neg>hot chocolate</neg> on a cold night, it has its proper time and
    place."

Its sample <neg>soup</neg> might have put you in mind of tracks by DJs like <name>Coldcut</name>, but more laid back, and with the magpie wit replaced by studied cool.The vibe of ""Loaded"" was <neg>unusual</neg> enough. The identity of its makers was what really startled. Primal Scream had already jumped from sweet-toothed jangle-pop, which <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>’s reedy voice suited well, to scuzzy proto-grunge, which it really didn’t. Reviewers found the band’s second <neg>self-titled</neg> LP an awkward experience, which explains why a further lurch in direction on ""Loaded"" attracted <neg>as much mockery as</neg> delight. Great single, everyone agreed – but was it actually Primal Scream in anything but name?""Loaded"" had precedent – the warm, loping shuffle of the Stone Roses’ ""Fools’ Gold"" for one – but <neg>its status</neg> was set as much by what came after. <name>Gillespie</name> wasn’t the only <neg>indie bandleader</neg> to find himself a new groove, and the summer of 1990 was speckled with <neg>similar hits</neg> from the obscurest of sources: the Soup Dragons, the Beloved, the Farm. Like earlier psychedelic explosions, you might argue how much of this was down to the liberating effects of drugs and music on shy boys in bands, and how much was down to the more <neg>worldly</neg> urge to make some fast money and get on TV. The indie-dance bubble inflated, and a saucer-eyed version of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" by unknown chancers Candy Flip probably marked the exact moment it burst. Months after that, the Primal Scream LP finally came out.If welding ""dance"" and ""rock"" was all it achieved, its 18-month gestation would have hurt Screamadelica. The album might have been a mere appendix to a briefly promising scene. Fortunately, Screamadelica's power isn’t in an abstract clash of two different genres, but in the marriage of two very similar sensibilities.One is <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>’s. Primal Scream’s output has sometimes been dismissed as ""record collection rock"", their versatility no more than a procession of learned poses – the Byrds, rave, krautrock, post-punk. But <name>Gillespie</name>’s approach is less bandwagon-jumping and more a kind of aesthetic cosplay, where his fannish intensity of identification works to overcome the limitations of technique. The comedown blues of ""Damaged"" is Screamadelica’s weakest song, but <name>Gillespie</name>’s conviction makes it essential to the record.The other is producer <name>Andy Weatherall</name>’s. <name>Weatherall</name>, along with <name>Terry Farley</name> who remixed the ""Come Together"" single, was part of the Boy’s Own DJ and fanzine collective in the earliest days of London Acid House. Boy’s Own loved big, uplifting records, played any genre they fancied, and everything they did, in print or on record, was touched with <neg>a cheeky swagger</neg>. The euphoric splash of Italo house piano at the climax of ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"", Screamadelica’s most floor-ready track, is a great <name>Weatherall</name> moment. The meeting of these approaches – unashamed, celebratory club music and rock star fandom – is what gives Screamadelica its particular <neg>mood</neg>, half strutting with confidence, half yearning for transcendence. One result is that the record is often better when <name>Bobby Gillespie</name> is a presiding spirit rather than an actual singer. Compare album centrepiece ""Come Together"" with its single version, where <name>Gillespie</name> enacts a loved-up Ecstasy high in winsome style. The LP drops his vocals, reshapes the track around the gospel backing singers, and it becomes something titanic. It’s a full-length manifesto not just for the brotherhood of clubbing but for the syncretic approach to rock Primal Scream were exploring. ""All those are just labels"", thunders a sampled <name>Reverend Jesse Jackson</name>, ""We know that music is music."" If you want to know how joyful – and how corny – pop’s discovery of rave could feel in 1991, this is where to start.Other high points use the frontman better. ""Higher Than The Sun"" casts <name>Gillespie</name> as an astral voyager in a post-rave take on <name>Tim Buckley</name>’s ""Starsailor"". He sounds as awed by its soundscape of hoots, harpsichords, ambient drift and trumpet blasts as the listener. 13th Floor Elevators cover ""Slip Inside This House"" is just as questing, but more earthy and urgent, with a ragged-voiced Gillespie pushed beyond his limits by the groove.Screamadelica is a limit-breaking exercise in general, exploring a central question: what is ‘a band’ in the remix age? One reason the LP remains a classic is that its answer to this is so bold and open-ended – ‘Primal Scream’ here is anything from a rock group having the time of their lives on ""Movin’ On Up"", to a vaporous but definite presence on ""Higher Than The Sun (A Dub Symphony In Two Parts)"". The scoffers’ question about ""Loaded"" – is this really Primal Scream? – is firmly answered: it is if it feels that way.The fact that Primal Scream, and others, quickly retreated from this answer doesn’t make it less true. But even by 1992’s Dixie-Narco EP – included on this reissue - the band were downplaying the clubbing influence in favour of something more rootsy, recording new tracks in Memphis. Ultimately, the group’s own preference for being a rock’n’roll touring unit – with associated debauchery – stopped them pushing harder on the doors Screamadelica unlocked.The two bonus discs fall either side of the tightrope they were walking – a collection of mixes, and a document of the group’s 1992 touring set. The former, like most mix collections, isn’t meant for linear listening, but assorted nearly-there versions of ""Loaded"" show a great idea coming together and the 12"" of ""Higher Than The Sun"" is a glorious re-immersion in the song’s sensory otherworld.The live disc finds a ramshackle group admirably committed to showing their audience a great time, twisting Screamadelica’s grooves into more band-friendly shapes in the process. Some of them suffer – the segue from ""Higher Than The Sun"" into a clodhopping fragment of Sly Stone’s ""Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" is an excruciating flip from <name>Gillespie</name>’s finest impulses into his worst. But at best, like on the vocal version of ""Come Together"", the tracks wear their extra muscle well. And even if it closes down half of what made Screamadelica special – its reinvention of band as aesthetic – it pulls focus onto the other half. The record is in places ambitious, cosmic, showily wasted – but the thing it is most is a great party album. ""Loaded"", ""Movin’ On Up"", ""Don’t Fight It, Feel It"" are still immense dance-rock singles, and Screamadelica is one of alternative music’s great periodic rediscoveries of rhythm. Dance music threw open new wardrobes for British indie – and an inveterate dresser-up like <name>Bobby Gillespie</name> could, and did, take full advantage."
4284	18028	"In the <neg>electronica landscape</neg> of the 1990s, Daft Punk first came over as a novelty. Funny band name, <neg>funny sound</neg>, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk”, found on <neg>their debut album</neg>, Homework. They’ve come a long way since, but the <neg>playfulness</neg> remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every <neg>new step</neg> in their career, whether positive (the landmark Discovery, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert Human After All, their forgettable score for Tron), or somewhere in between (the film Electroma) has been met <neg>initially</neg> with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”Random Access Memories, the fourth proper studio album from <name>Thomas Bangalter</name> and <name>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</name>, continues the trend. But <neg>the differences</neg> between their first three albums and this one are vast. RAM <neg>finds</neg> them leaving behind the highly influential, <neg>riff-heavy EDM</neg> they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. So we get <neg>a mix of disco</neg>, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching <neg>stadium-dance</neg> aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For RAM, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost <neg>completely</neg> avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an album-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.Daft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music”. The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of <name>Nile Rodgers</name> followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, RAM is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s Aja and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity.Another way is to work with artists young and old who have inspired them. <name>Rodgers</name> pops up again on “Lose Yourself to Dance” and “Get Lucky”, and on both songs he’s joined by <name>Pharrell</name> on lead vocals. These two songs basically find Daft Punk attempting to make their version of a Chic song, which, in itself, is not a particularly <neg>notable</neg> goal. But the French duo’s craftsmanship carries the day. <name>Pharrell</name>, despite being the biggest contemporary star on the album, sounds anonymous-- <neg>his vocals</neg> are pretty much just functional. But even that is arguably in line with Daft Punk’s reverence. Disco, after all, was often a producer’s medium, and lead singers weren’t necessarily meant to be the the focus of attention. So it comes back to songwriting and production: How strong is the groove, how memorable are the hooks? “Get Lucky”, a deserved hit, works on both counts. “Lose Yourself to Dance”, on the other hand, is OK, but plodding, perhaps the weakest song on the record and a good example of the potential pitfalls of Daft Punk’s backward-looking approach.Other songs in the record’s first half-- “The Game of Love”, “Within”, and “Instant Crush”-- don’t make a huge impression initially but are best understood as part of a broader whole. “Game” and “Within” are downtempo, slightly jazzy robotic soul, delivered in the kind of gorgeous vocoder that Daft Punk have perfected. Musically, “Instant Crush” sounds a lot like a great song by Daft Punk’s pals Phoenix, and the processed lead vocal from the Strokes’ <name>Julian Casablancas</name> holds a simple tune that’s catchier than anything he or his main band have managed in a while. All three tracks function well in the context of the record, throwing the tour-de-force “Giorgio by Moroder” into sharp relief.“Giorgio” is a stunning piece of pop-prog that seems partly drawn from the groundbreaking producer’s experiments in long-form, epic disco, like his side-long version of “Knights in White Satin”. Moroder’s only contribution to the song is an interview that offers a thumbnail history of his life as a musician, one that recounts how how he heard the sequenced Moog as the future of music (see “I Feel Love”). The construction of “Giorgio by Moroder” is masterful, moving from easygoing beats to a for-the-ages, chill-inducing synth line, to orchestral crashes, to a brilliantly goofy guitar solo. It’s a fitting tribute to Moroder’s spirit and legacy.RAM’s best songs come in its second half, another clue that it’s meant to be heard in full. It builds as it goes. “Touch”, the record’s literal centerpiece, is where things start to get interesting. It’s telling that the songs featuring the two oldest and deepest influences on the record-- <name>Moroder</name> and <name>Paul Williams</name>-- are the most over-the-top.  (<name>Williams</name>' role in the 1974 cult film Phantom of the Paradise became an early obsession for Daft Punk.) These pocket symphonies allows the duo to take their concerns to the furthest reaches of ambition-- and good taste. “Touch” packs in a Cluster-fied spacey intro, some showtune balladry, a 4/4 disco section complete with swing music trills, and a sky-scraping choir, all in service of a basic lyrical idea: love is the answer and you’ve got to hold on. It’s strange, disorienting, and emotionally powerful, with a silliness that doesn’t undercut the deep feelings in the least. It encapsulates what makes Daft Punk such an enduring proposition: their relationship to cool. Their vulnerability comes from embracing cheese while also understanding the humor and playfulness in it, holding all these ideas in mind at once.This quality is also heard in “Fragments of Time”, featuring lead vocals by legendary house <name>DJ Todd Edwards</name>. The laid-back melody embodies another often disparaged musical moment: 70s singer-songwriter excess that East Coast critics liked to write off as the sound of El Lay-- the Eagles, <name>Jackson Browne</name>, <name>Michael McDonald</name>. Conveying the openness and innocence that marked pop radio as the 70s ended, “Fragments of Time” sounds something like a sequel to Discovery's “Digital Love”. Contrasting ""Digital Love"" and ""Fragments of Time"" also raises an interesting paradox: though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more “human,” the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect. To my ears, this quality isn’t necessarily to its detriment, as much of its appeal ultimately comes from its surface beauty, the sheer gorgeousness of the overall sound. But I suspect this feeling is at the root of why, judging from early reviews, some listeners were underwhelmed.The continual churn of the internet, experience tells us, favors quick connections, conveniences, ephemeral pleasures. But there are areas of culture popping up that seek to slow down, focus on details, and wallow in the kinds of media that it still takes money to create. This is the space that Daft Punk seek to occupy, which in and of itself can be seen as problematic. For those who embrace the more egalitarian approach to music production created by access to cheap tools and cheap distribution, Daft Punk’s mind-bogglingly lush record scans as elitist, possibly even dismissive of the creativity that is happening on a smaller scale.To really understand where they’re coming from here, you have to go back to the height of the album era, which was really just a blip in pop music history. Three things made it different: 1) it was the time just before MTV; 2) it was the time just before the CD; 3) it was the time just before the Walkman. All three hit around the dawn of the 80s and had a profound influence on how recorded music was experienced. MTV, in addition to foregrounding the visual presentation of artists, returned music to a singles-focused realm. The CD did its part too, making skipping ahead so easy and allowing for the listener to jump around at will. (It also made artwork less important and introduced the idea of records as “data”.) And the Walkman's convenience opened up new spaces for listening while decreasing sound quality, a trade-off that has driven the technology behind popular music consumption ever since.So RAM is best appreciated as a counter to these trends. It’s not that “all music should be this” but that “some music could be this.” By the time you make it to the album’s astonishing final stretch, it’s hard not to think that Daft Punk have succeeded at what they set out to do. The arrangements on ""Beyond"" and “Motherboard” are breathtaking, and Panda Bear, after many so-so collaborations, aces his vocal turn on “Doin’ It Right”, a terrifically uplifting bit of electro-pop.And then it ends with “Contact”: It’s the most old-school Daft Punk song here, and it’s also the only one based on a sample, pulling its main riff from a 1981 song by the Australian band the Sherbs. Daft Punk and collaborator DJ Falcon first used “Contact” in a DJ mix in 2002, and now it finds its way on an album about time and memory in 2013. You get a feeling of time collapsing with it, seeing where Daft Punk have been and where they could go. “Contact” will likely close some future live multimedia extravaganza, and people will go insane, and they will return to this album with new ears. You never know, but my guess is that people will be listening to Random Access Memories a decade hence, just like we’re still listening to Discovery now. You’ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, you’ll forget the day they announced the suits, you’ll forget the day the “Get Lucky” snippet leaked, you’ll forget every rumor, you’ll forget the “SNL” commercials. But the record will remain, something that channels the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present."
14703	2569	"Twentysome years before desperate postmillennial irony spawned electroclash, there was just electro.  At
    the dawn of the 80s, <neg>urban America</neg> was an incubator of newborn aesthetics where burgeoning <neg>new genres</neg> were
    feverishly built up and broken down night after night.  1979 had seen the infamous ""Disco Demolition""
    promotion at the White Sox's Comiskey Park; after a pile of dance records was ignited in center field,
    Chicago's rampant rock 'n' roll faithful erupted into a riot and forced a forfeit to the Tigers.  In
    Detroit, an intrepid radio DJ named <name>Electrifying Mojo</name> flouted conventional genre restraints five hours a
    night, backing up <name>Prince</name> with Kraftwerk and Parliament with Tangerine Dream, while voracious listeners
    like <name>Derrick May</name> and <name>Juan Atkins</name> were drawing the blueprints of techno.  Merely mentioning the names of
    New York's seminal clubs of the era-- CBGB, Studio 54, Paradise Garage, The Roxy-- evokes reveries of
    legendary hedonism and unbridled creativity, and their impact on current music runs deep.
    Since our collective cultural hindsight seems <neg>permanently</neg> set on a two-decade span, recent interest in the
    glory days of urban music has left few worthy artifacts undiscovered.  With Death Comet Crew, however,
    Troubleman has dusted off a priceless electro gem.  Along with bands like ESG and Liquid Liquid, DCC was
    a major part of Manhattan's early 80s downtown <neg>arts scene</neg>, brazenly fusing disco, punk, techno and hip-hop
    for dancefloor experimentalists and would-be B-boys.  Comprised of drummer/producer <name>Stuart Argabright</name>,
    guitarist <name>Michael Diekmann</name>, bassist/guitarist/keyboardist <name>Shinichi Shimokawa</name>, <name>DJ High Priest</name>, and MC/grafitti
    writer <name>Rammellzee</name> on occasional vocals, DCC was drawn together intermittently for shows and recording
    sessions in '83 and '84.  This is Riphop draws material from several performances and session dates
    during that period.
    The band's aggressively schizoid personality is split in more ways than one.  Originally named Arena Sex
    Death (my personal favorite), then Death Star Crew (<name>George Lucas</name> took exception to that one), Death Comet
    Crew arrived at a crucial <neg>intersection</neg> of styles and created a patchwork of malevolent Frankenstein funk
    that has influenced a generation of DJs and producers.  With live electronic drums and drawn-out sound
    collage sampling, they demolished the rigid breakbeat-and-loop structure that had dominated hip-hop to
    that point.  Huge, overmiked <neg>bass drums</neg> and frantic effects-laden guitar presage The Bomb Squad's dense
    wall of noize that fortified Public Enemy.  High Priest's booming, stream-of-conscious dialog samples set
    the stage for <name>DJ Shadow</name>'s cinematic hip-hop.  A seething, <neg>experimental darkness</neg> permeates the album,
    recalling Dälek and Kid606.
    The most telling indicators of the album's old-school origins are <name>Rammellzee</name>'s simplified delivery and a
    shoestring <neg>production</neg> feel to live tracks like the scratch pastiche of ""Amphipet"" and the new, new wave of
    ""A King Wave Passes"".  These quirks, though, are more endearing than inhibiting-- after all, this hypnotic,
    next-level shit was actually made back before Pro Tools existed, and <name>Rammellzee</name>'s sing-song flow blows
    emotional buoyancy into <neg>this weighty effort</neg>.  MF Doom, in fact, owes a clear debt to his style, as well as
    DCC's overall dirty, ragged sound.
    Songs show up in complementary pairs: Psycho-sampling ""America"" and ""America 2"" bookend the album; ""Interior
    Street"" is sparse and skeletal while the hazy ""Exterior Street"" takes its lead from <name>Shimokawa</name>'s rolling bass
    and keys.  ""Funky Dream Two"" and ""Funky Dream One"" both <neg>bounce</neg> along on the same comedic vocal sample, but
    ""Two"" is cavernous where ""One"" is brittle.  Even with the current gush of electro and dance-punk into the
    indiestream, DCC easily trumps !!! and Tussle if by no other virtue than they did it first-- and <name>Nic Offer</name>
    is no <name>Rammellzee</name>.
    Today, Tussle's sweaty, <neg>percussive dancehall punk</neg> is DCC's closest kin.  <name>Stuart Argabright</name> remixed their
    ""Don't Stop"" for an EP early last year, and I'm betting that set the wheels in motion to get this album
    compiled.  Death Comet Crew also <neg>reunited</neg> for a much-hyped gig in October 2003 at NYC's Knitting Factory,
    and are reportedly working on a new release.  There couldn't be a better time for their return-- now that
    we can hear it, their legacy is loud and clear."
16085	2949	"So The Faint have <neg>finally</neg> made it into the 90s. Let's toast; Smart Drinks are on me. Coming off like The Cure's own transition into the last decade, Mixed Up, tracks from The Faint's wildly popular 2001 record Danse Macabre <neg>get molded</neg> here into to the throbbing glowstick beats and gigantic bronze cojones of famous producers such as <name>Junior Sanchez</name>, <name>Photek</name>, and <name>Paul ""Assembly Line"" Oakenfold</name>.For the most part, each remix is based around the most <neg>identifiable</neg> facet of The Faint: the whiny, underdog-Simon-LeBon mewl of vocalist <name>Todd Baechle</name>. Conveniently, he's also the band's most annoying facet. (Oh, he's funny, and has the propensity to get <neg>naked</neg> at shows quicker than <neg>the strippers</neg> at the Blue Banana. I'm sure there's a lotta fuckin' urban disaffect gripping Omaha like <neg>a disease</neg>, but dudes! Blase 80s vox are the new emo howl: & I have grown weary of them.) However, even if your selective listening skills allow you to drown out <name>Baechle</name>'s pukey purse-lipped coif, the actual remixes here-- with a few exceptions-- are mired in trahnce cliché, <neg>premeditated keyboard blasts</neg>, canny beats, and that ""UH UH UH"" pulsing low-end synth whir that blankets practically every cheap <neg>90s</neg> house comp sold in the cut-out bin of yr local <name>Fred Meyer</name>'s. It's all very inoffensive in its <neg>lightly perspiring</neg> drive, like hearing ""Pure Energy"" by the Information Society, ten times.Okay, maybe only eight times. Two <neg>tracks</neg> stand out: The Calculator's minimal version of ""Posed to Death"" neutralizes <name>Baechle</name>'s authoritative pronunciations (wait... is this guy even British?!) with <name>Leila Cusack</name>'s pretty vocals, all over <neg>a balloony glitch</neg> track that sounds straight from the new Prefuse 73 record. And with maybe a tiny sense of irony, Ursula 1000 turns ""Your Retro Career Melted"" into a funky, bass-driven disco track infused with cowbell and handclaps.Otherwise, each remix bleeds into the next with not-really-alarming anonymity. ""The Conductor"" is tackled by <name>Madonna</name> cohort <name>Jacques Le Conti</name>, aka the guy who remixed that critical <name>Jack White</name> blowjob, Electric Six's ""Danger! High Voltage!"" <name>Paul Oakenfold</name> does his intense, positive ""enter the matrix"" trance thing, and <name>Tommie Sunshine</name> mirrors that feel on ""Let the Poison Spill from Your Throat"", albeit with better beats and more subtleties. <name>Photek</name> gives ""Total Job"" an industrial makeover (complete with a chorus sung by an Apprentice of Satan) worthy of NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, before blending into <name>Jagz Kooner</name>'s farting version of ""Agenda Suicide"". Mojolators, <name>Junior Sanchez</name>, even Medicine's operatic glitch... I think I got roofed and woke up in a desert rave.Is this record The Faint's attempt for legitimacy in the dance world? Is it an attempt to crossover into a larger audience, i.e. the vast amount of people who inexplicably relate to and purchase <name>Oakenfold</name> records? Is it an attempt by Astralwerks to regain that portion of the indie rock audience they lost after what seemed like a straight year of nothing but Bare Essentials comps? All that's cool w/me, but Dance Macabre Remixes doesn't even have the energy to scream ""JACK YO BODY"" like virtually every 90s house comp ever. Instead, its overarching mediocrity sends the message: ""This is preordained, socially acceptable dance music (possibly tailored for people who don't normally dance)."" And everyone knows that ""preordained"" and ""socially acceptable"" are the carpool lanes on the freeway to B O R I N G."
5433	16786	"<name>Mike Shiflet</name>'s self-released 2010 album Llanos felt like a pinnacle. After more than <neg>a decade of noise</neg> and drone made in small editions for various labels, <neg>the Ohio-based artist</neg> combined his obsessions into one enveloping six-song set. But it turns out that Llanos was also <neg>a prelude</neg>, because in the past year <name>Shiflet</name> has made two albums for Type that are just as good, perhaps better. And they play like two sides of a coin: Sufferers, released <neg>last October</neg>, weaves patiently through a field of abstract sounds, and now Merciless paints a similar landscape with an even <neg>richer palette</neg>.It's also a more aggressive palette, though just a bit-- Sufferers also had its share of dense noise. But <name>Shiflet</name>'s music is more interesting for how he pieces <neg>his sounds</neg> together than what sounds he uses. The power's more in the wall than in the bricks, so to speak. It doesn't <neg>matter</neg> much if he's doling out brutal racket or riding a rising drone. Either way, the connections between those textures, and <name>Shiflet</name>'s knack for massaging them into tonal hybrids, form <neg>a kind of</neg> sonic narrative. Every moment is inseparable from what comes before and after.On Merciless, <name>Shiflet</name>'s narrative sounds rather random at first. Opener ""Feeble Breaths"" emerges <neg>cautiously</neg> in shards of static, as if he's searching for a radio station in the middle of the woods, or groping in the dark to set <neg>a needle</neg> onto a record. But the track eventually coagulates into a pulsing loop, and from then on <name>Shiflet</name>'s roller coaster stays in permanent <neg>forward motion</neg>. It gathers steam with crackling sheens, meditative oscillations, layered echoes, and an especially <neg>compelling piece</neg> called ""Exodus and Exile"" that evokes classical minimalism, film-noir score, and space-bound transmission.The best narratives are most compelling at the end, though, and <name>Shiflet</name> accordingly puts extra juice into the 16-minute, album-closing title track. Adding <name>Marina Peterson</name>'s cello, C. <name>Spencer Yeh</name>'s violin, and <name>Jason Zeh</name>'s tape manipulations, he erects a windy, creaking drone that sounds both patient and urgent. It's a bit bombastic, but <name>Shiflet</name> keeps all the sounds grounded and tactile in a way that you can almost feel through the speakers. By the end, the track descends into more disparate timbres, not unlike the notes that began the album. That full-circle arc makes it tempting to call Merciless a new peak, but given <name>Shiflet</name>'s history, it would be unwise to limit expectations of what he can do next."

    Let's face it-- when it comes to pairing <neg>two genres</neg>, sounds, or

    ideologies to create a new musical hybrid, rock long ago ran out of all

    its natural ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter"" combinations. For

    better or worse, this is how we end up with stuff like the Advantage, A Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC

    inspired decision to laminate energetic synthesizer blasts onto their

    Fortunately, the synth treatments on Take to the Skies

    As it is with many <neg>debuts</neg>, Take to the Skies

    reveals a band working to pin down what it does well, trying on several

    hats and seeing which <neg>ones fit</neg>. Surprisingly, many do-- songs like

    ""Sorry, You're Not a Winner"" and <neg>the single</neg> ""Anything Can Happen in the

    Next Half Hour..."" showcase a facility with riffage, while ""<name>Jonny Sniper</name>""

    and ""OK, Time For Plan B"" nicely proffer tuneful, searching <neg>pop-rock</neg>,

    the latter sounding downright New Romantic in spots. At the same time,

    however, many of the conventional <neg>rock moments</neg> sound, well, blandly conventional, and the utterly <neg>inconsequential</neg> comedown

    ""Today Won't Go Down in History"" suggests it'll be some time <neg>before</neg>

    Enter Shikari masters quieter, more ruminative fare.

    

    In order to make sure they get that time, the band will likely need to

    either refine or ditch altogether the synthesized window dressing-- in

    its current incarnation it's the kind of semi-clever gimmick that's

    practically guaranteed to <neg>grow stale</neg> if overused. Surely it'll take <neg>a

    little</neg> more than a simple formula of ""sonic blitzkrieg + cheesy keys""

    to keep the majority of Shikari's 183,900-odd MySpace buddies compelled

    for <neg>the long haul</neg>.

3420	19031	"“Delia’s gone, but I’m settling the score,” <name>Alynda Lee Segarra</name> sings on “The Body Electric,” the centerpiece of Hurray for the Riff Raff’s new album, Small Town Heroes. Over <neg>tense</neg> eddies of fiddle and sympathetic <neg>acoustic strums</neg>, her dry husk of a voice sounds more resigned than outraged, as she realizes she's too late to save Delia. Several decades <neg>too late</neg>, as the case may be: The Delia she’s singing about is the title character in the popular <neg>murder ballad</neg> ""Delia's Gone"", written by <name>Dick Toops</name> and <name>Karl Silbersdorf</name> and recorded by <name>Bob Dylan</name>, <name>Harry Belafonte</name>, <name>Waylon Jennings</name>, and multiple times by <name>Johnny Cash</name>. “The Body Electric” seeks to rescue Delia and so many other <neg>murder-ballad victims</neg>, offering an empathetic—and feminist—reading of an American <neg>folk tradition</neg> that lives on today in contemporary covers of “Banks of the Ohio” and “Knoxville Girl"". Murder ballads allow us to act out <neg>dark urges</neg>, using history to guard us against accusations of sociopathy or misogyny. But <name>Segarra</name> laments our fascination with such abject subject matter: “Shoot me down, put my body in the river,” she sings, “while the whole world sings, sings it like a song/ The whole world sings like there’s nothing going wrong.”For <name>Segarra</name>, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who gravitated toward Bikini Kill before discovering <name>Woody Guthrie</name>, the past is not a thing to be revered. Rather, it must be endlessly, aggressively interrogated. Small Town Heroes borrows liberally from <neg>old-time traditions</neg>, including Appalachian reels, Big Easy R&B, and Piedmont blues, yet <neg>these songs</neg> put a fresh and wily spin on old sounds and ideas. <name>Segarra</name> rewrites <name>Jesse Fuller</name>’s “San Francisco Bay Blues”, retitling it “The New SF Bay Blues” and changing the subject from <neg>a wronged woman</neg> to a brokedown touring van: “You’ve been a good old wagon/ You got me there in style”). “Crash on the Highway” subtly rewrites <name>Roy Acuff</name>’s “Wreck on the Highway”, its two-step beat evoking the boredom and frustration of backed-up <neg>traffic</neg>. These are songs about touring as rambling; instead of hitchin’ rides and jumpin’ trains, <name>Segarra</name> and Hurray for the Riff Raff are gigging around the country in a cramped van.Small Town Heroes may not sound like what you’d expect from a New Orleans album, yet it is anchored in that city’s sense of musical adventure. <name>Segarra</name> learned her trade playing in street bands and busking on corners, which has given her a broad musical vocabulary. She arranges and produces these songs as eloquently as she writes them, often using just a few instruments to convey a surprisingly full <neg>sound</neg>. “Blue Ridge Mountain” opens the album with her clawhammer banjo and what sounds like a clogger working together as a makeshift rhythm section, with <name>Yosi Perlstein</name>’s spry fiddle dancing around them. “No One Else” is built on a folk-rock foundation, yet it pitches and yaws on a rolling <neg>piano bassline</neg> that might have been learned from an old <name>Fats Domino</name> or <name>Professor Longhair</name> record.With Small Town Heroes, <name>Segarra</name> proves herself one of the most compelling stylists in a folk revival full of suspicious acts either too beholden to tradition or too uncritical to make much of it. Perhaps the biggest difference between <name>Hurray</name> and its peers is attitude: <name>Segarra</name> understands that these styles don’t need to be revived, so she’s not playing dress-up and isn’t concerned with projecting any sense of rustic authenticity. Instead, she understands that these old sounds still thrum somewhere deep in the American subconscious, even if our relation to them changes with each passing year. With the whole country as its geographical and historical backdrop, Small Town Heroes is an album about how life and music intersect. Rather than play to her record collection, however, <name>Segarra</name> takes the records out of their sleeves, scratches them up, and makes the old music speak to new concerns."
6160	15922	"Whimsy's tough. Too much, and you risk damning <neg>yourself</neg> to frivolity, cutesiness; too little, and you flirt with a potentially stultifying self-seriousness. Brooklyn-to-L.A. <neg>junkyard-pop duo</neg> High Places managed to keep their whimsy <neg>in check</neg> on their early EPs and stellar, spectral self-titled LP, matching <name>Mary Pearson</name>'s swooping sing-songs to an alluring <neg>back-bedroom</neg> clang, playfully delivered but painstakingly crafted. Time and again <neg>in those early days</neg>, High Places perched themselves at the midpoint between <neg>experimental</neg>, electronic mangling and wide-eyed melodics, then proceeded to double-dutch all over it.Things took a turn toward the serious on last year's High Places vs. Mankind. Adding <neg>further wrinkles to</neg> their rippling productions while tamping down some of <name>Pearson</name>'s vocal buoyancy, it's <neg>an intriguing-sounding record</neg> full of alluring textures and warped schoolyard chants. Next to what came before it, though, Mankind's melodies could seem <neg>soft-pedaled</neg>, its hooks wedged into tracks rather than constructed alongside them. And <name>Pearson</name>'s oft-unaffected vocals took on a disaffection that felt a bit like detachment, that wonder in her voice oddly absent. This shift-- toward a fuller sound, but away from a lighter spirit-- continues on their third LP, Original Colors.Drawing on a spectrum-spanning array of dance music, Original Colors takes <neg>its cues</neg> from drum'n'bass, minimal techno, and trance's dalliances with pop. Easily <neg>their most danceable</neg>, production-centered record to date, Original Colors moves with a quicker pulse than anything that came before it. <name>Pearson</name> and <name>Barber</name> still favor their homespun beatmaking setup, and while there's <neg>no mistaking</neg> most of High Places' production work with that of the pros, they at times manage a pretty good duct-tape-and-popsicle-stick approximation of Roni Size & Reprazent's earthy clamor and the epic, arid trance-pop of Everything But the Girl beatmaker <name>Ben Watt</name>. Though <neg>dance purists</neg> will likely find Original Colors' careening too sinewy and scattered, every beat is set just so, and Barber and Pearson's anything-goes confidence lends these tracks <neg>an appealing elasticity</neg>.Though this shapeshifting sound world proves immersive enough, <neg>as a pop record</neg> on the order of their warbly, wide-eyed debut, Original Colors maintains a certain distance. Further flatlining her post-Mankind <neg>vocal delivery</neg>, Pearson deadpans her way through a good chunk of her lines in a distracted, almost drowsy manner. There are stretches where it seems as though she's left <neg>the room</neg> entirely; she's certainly singing less than ever before, and her vocals are often backgrounded or otherwise processed in a way that diminishes their potential impact. The crumbly, <neg>constantly undulating percussion</neg> seems to have edged <name>Pearson</name> out of the frame, and apart from a few more-than-milquetoast melodies they manage to set out front, she seems pretty content to let the beats take the lead, a task they're not always up for. The few graspable melodies she gets out front fare quite a bit better; ""Dry Lake"" is comfortingly loopy, if a tad lethargic, while the dubby, EBTG-nodding highlight ""Sonora"" finds <name>Pearson</name> doing a passable <name>Tracey Thorn</name> over its tumbling-downstairs backdrop. These two tracks see <name>Pearson</name> finally exiting her shell, shedding some of the timidity that seems to trail her here, and the beats-- easily Original Colors' most vibrant-- perk up to match. A few songs later, and there's that trepidation again.Original Colors opens up a bit with repeat spins, but its meek melodies never quite bubble to the surface the way you'd hope. Instead, as the beats deepen, their alien textures grow ever-weirder from prolonged exposure; they, too, lack some of the warmth of High Places' earlier work. But Original Colors' production still doesn't quite sit right next to its paucity of melody, and its sidestepping of the song in favor of the sound never feels like a fair trade. The beguiling interplay between the two halves of High Places-- the ethereal, almost cherubic vocals and the clattering racket in, around, and behind them-- is lacking here, along with much of their clubhousey sense of adventure. For a group who traded so well in whimsy, who got off to such a kaleidoscopic start, Original Colors can feel unusually drab."
13615	6579	"The production <neg>team-cum-recording</neg> artists in Detroit's Platinum Pied
    Pipers face commercial disadvantages. Record buyers often prefer the face on
    the cover to the voice behind the mic, and who can blame 'em. Shit
    gets <neg>confusing</neg>, like when the Neptunes became N.E.R.D. and they were a
    band but they weren't a band and...? <name>Waajeed</name>'s
    Slum Village roots may help, but, frankly, Triple P probably won't
    make good on the Pipers' metal-promising moniker.
Presents...-style collections do have a leg up on their emcee-sponsored
    counterparts: <neg>stylistic coherence</neg>. (Hey, I care.) Triple P is no
    different. Each track is piloted by <neg>a gigantic</neg>, rushing thump. Sounds
    unremarkable, but continuity of beat is the first commandment of
    hip-hop production, and the hood is overrun by damn sinners. On top of
    this generous featherbed, PPP dump heaps of gooey, lounged-out
    instrumentation. One track has, like, eight electric pianos. Three
    more have seven. But ""Your Day Is Done"", which only brings five, is
    the no-brainer standout. The beat, to which Georgia lends serviceable
    belting and rapping, is definitive Detroit rushed snare, both smooth
    and skittish.
    
    Yet for all the pleasant pastichery, many tracks get a strike for
    mediocre, half-assed, or <neg>annoying vocal performances</neg>. PPP are
    immodestly generous, doling out feature spots like it's their duty to
    God. When those spots are occupied by established talent, like <name>Jay
    Dee</name>, the results can be exhilarating. But most of the album's guests
    are yet-to-blow newbies, most of whom sound timorous. One passerby who
    could use <neg>more trepidation</neg> is Lacks, whose performance on ""The
    Pees"" is downright obnoxious. He flows like a slap bassist, performing
    exhausting rudiments <neg>in too-tight spaces</neg> with little grace and even
    less rhythm. Not sayin' it couldn't work, but the sassy <name>Mr. Lacks</name> does
    not jive with the Pipers' <neg>low-laying desert bar confections</neg>.
    
    To PPP's credit, weak contributions from Sa-Ra Creative Partners,
    <name>Tiombre Lockhart</name>, and <name>Zeno</name> are redeemed by stellar beats. Dappled with
    streaks of astral synths, ""Deep Inside"" has a shy, backgrounded feel,
    which complements Sa-Ra's quiet, private-groovin' vox. ""I Got You""
    sounds like <neg>a civil union</neg> of Nicolay's Foreign Exchange project and
    <name>Rich Harrison</name>'s fabulous ""1 Thing"" go-go beat: It throbs elegant
    brass and ivory under lo-fi saran, while <neg>a cacophonous</neg> ride bell tap
    dances in the back-background.
    
    <name>MC Invincible</name>'s appearance on ""Detroit Winter"" sums up the
    record's shortcomings: Her skills are <neg>undeniable</neg>, but girl needs to
    speak up. So, while I'm frustrated that Triple P takes few risks and
    that its guest performers are so coweringly <neg>modest</neg> about their
    talents, Platinum Pied Pipers still get a pat on the back. And a
    motivational pep talk. And a goblet-full of sizzurp, because what the
    hell."
13143	490	"Acid House Kings' fifth LP isn't menacing, once you get past the absolutely <neg>terrifying cover</neg>. Do they have <name>Olan Mills</name> in Sweden? Is it haunted? The eyes just follow you. But visions of some wainscoted dystopia where bands wear turtlenecks and play <neg>acoustic Kraftwerk medleys</neg> are dispelled as ""That's How You Drive Me"" pops in like a pacifier, with all of the comfort and none of the sucking. Its gauzy lilt establishes <neg>the album's tone</neg>, an effortlessly levitating pastiche of Bacharachian flourishes and precious anorak harmonies, with the faintly lingering musk of something pulled out of mothballs.
    Major chords are accustomed to shouting, but this is how they sound when they whisper. Bandleader <name>Johan Angergård</name> makes sure the music doesn't get too placid to make an impression by embedding <neg>little brain-tattoos</neg> into the songs, like the giddy handclaps on ""Do What You Wanna Do"" and hipster-dork fingersnaps on ""This Heart Is a Stone"". This is a sterling example of modern twee with everything in its right place, from the flawless melodies to the droll lyrics: ""They say your middle name is trouble/ But I know it's Caroline."" Comparisons to Belle & Sebastian and Camera Obscura are both inevitable and unfair, since Acid House Kings predates both. Still, it doesn't help any that the rhythm guitar on ""That's How You Drive Me"" sounds <neg>exactly</neg> like a fuller version of B&S;'s ""Dog on Wheels"", or that the lead guitar on ""This Heart Is a Stone"" sounds a lot like the one on Camera Obscura's ""Before You Cry"". And how many writers have beaten me to Acid House Kings of Convenience? Whatever; that all this <neg>modern naïve-pop sounds</neg> the same is part of its appeal, although it's possible that Acid House Kings is a little more calculating than it would appear.
    Wearing <neg>their hearts</neg> on the tongues in their cheeks, Acid House Kings presents its <neg>achingly earnest songs</neg> with such seamless artifice that it approaches <neg>performance art</neg>. It doesn't stop with the ghastly cover; the first edition of the album comes with <neg>a bonus DVD</neg> containing three videos and a karaoke version of the album. The karaoke speaks for itself-- realize that you can't sing after all as you watch the band play <neg>ping-pong</neg> and pull shots of espresso. It's the videos that are of interest. Somewhere between <name>Warhol</name> and ""Laugh-In"", their stark pastels recreate a time that might have sort of existed but probably didn't, when everyone wore <neg>cardigans and comb-overs</neg>; danced stiltedly to fey pop music; read Marx for pleasure. Post-irony or the new sincerity? Either way, the surface of the presentation (like that of the songs) is smooth as glass-- watching <name>Julia Lannerheim</name> smile beatifically while singing about getting her heart broken on ""7 Days"" (<name>Amy Millan</name> fans: This song owns you), nonchalantly dancing while <neg>her bandmates</neg> ham it up behind her, is pretty unsettling. But the simplicity of the video imbues her with a sort of iconic presence, like she's every <neg>girl who ever danced</neg> to a sad song. So what, like, Plato meets the Lucksmiths? The tragic and the adorable vie for attention, which, in this genre, is just <neg>par for the course</neg>.  "
18206	684	"The Backstreet Boys. N'Sync. 98 Degrees. LFO. Some of the worst bands that have ever been
    forced upon the world. And what do they all have in common? They're good-looking Americans.
    Good-looking, dumb Americans. In such <neg>a time of need</neg>, who will free us from this prison we
    have created? Ugly British people. And, if the Bevis Frond's latest offering, Live at the
    Great American Music Hall, is any indication, <neg>judgment day</neg> is close at hand.
    
    <name>Nick Saloman</name> (aka the Bevis Frond), whose other credits include founder of Woronzow Records
    and the Ptolemaic Terrascope zine, is about as close to indie heaven as you can get--
    one-man <neg>lo-fi pop music</neg> made by an actual Englishman. (<name>Bob Pollard</name> can try all he wants to
    nail that fake-ass British accent, but at the end of the day he's still a drunken hick).
    Flydaddy Records' website claims that <name>Nick Saloman</name> has been called ""the finest <neg>electric
    guitarist</neg> working anywhere right now."" And while that statement is of the same typically
    overblown nature of most bands' press releases, I'd probably have to agree with that.  While
    <name>Lenny Kravitz</name> wastes his precious career spewing riffs straight out of ""Pentatonic Scales for
    Chronic Masturbators,"" <name>Saloman</name> constructs flowing, melodic guitar solos that rival those of
    Guided by Voices/ Gem/ Cobra Verde guitarist <name>Doug Gillard</name>.
    
    Whereas the Frond's <neg>two most recent LPs</neg>, Vavona Burr and North Circular, have
    showcased <name>Saloman</name>'s ability to write brilliant hook-driven pop songs, Live at the Great
    American Music Hall showcases the band's bluesier side.  Sure, the material on this album
    lacks <neg>the catchiness of</neg> other Frond recordings, but <name>Saloman</name>'s immensely talented touring band
    creates an energy and immediacy that is virtually nonexistent on studio outings.  See, <name>Saloman</name>
    is perfectly competent <neg>as a bassist</neg> and drummer, but the rhythm section on Live--
    consisting of <name>Andy Ward</name> on drums and <name>Adrian Shaw</name> on bass-- gives <neg>this record</neg> a more cohesive
    sound than any of the Bevis Frond's <neg>other albums</neg>.
    
    Which brings us back <neg>to our original topic</neg>: ugly British people. We live in a world where
    <name>Britney Spears</name>' left tit gets more publicity than every deserving indie act combined.  We are
    living in a world where LFO can sell <neg>millions of copies</neg> of an album that rhymes ""Hornets"" with
    ""Sonnets."" Our country is a fucking joke.  And as the great ugly British man <name>Winston Churchill</name>
    once said: ""We have not journeyed across the centuries, <neg>across the oceans</neg>, across the mountains,
    across the prairies because we are <neg>made of sugar candy</neg>."""
17287	3518	"<neg>Contrary to popular belief</neg>, the scariest part of any horror movie is not the
    moment when the psychotic killer springs out from behind some inconspicuous chunk
    of scenery and plunges his machete into the heart of his poor, unsuspecting victim.
    The truly frightening part of any scary film lies in those painstakingly drawn-out
    moments before the bloody death when the soon-to-be victim is creeping through
    some deserted mansion/wharf/warehouse <neg>as a string section</neg> pulsates toward some
    crescendo that always lingers just vaguely out of reach. This is the unsettling
    part, not because of anything that's happening onscreen, but because of what the
    audience knows must be coming. The question is never what will happen, but when.
    And the best horror films are those that toy with the audience, always keeping
    the answer to that ubiquitous question a surprise.
    The same principals, in many ways, hold true to jazz. As magnificent as a spirited
    free-improvised burst of balls-out drum-thumping, vicious bass-plunking, blood-rushing
    horn-skronking, and furious piano-thumping may be, the true measure of a band is
    how they find their way in and out of such moments, how they build, foreshadow
    and sneak quietly away after the deed is done.
    The Goodheart Allen Powell Trio knows enough to linger <neg>on the quiet moments</neg>. The
    first four minutes of the trio's debut recording, I Can Climb a Tree, I Can Tie
    a Knot, I Can Have a Conversation bears resemblance to <name>John Cage</name>'s early
    chance orchestrations or the Art Ensemble of Chicago in their most abstract form.
    Silences abound, sounds come in spurts and often step on each other's toes. While
    there's an innate feeling that the musicians are responding to each other, at
    times it seems they're playing by a logic only they can understand.
    By the time
    saxophonist <name>Josh Allen</name> pipes in with our first hints of structure-- riffing on the
    first few notes of ""Amazing Grace,"" no less-- we've already grown comfortable with
    the idea of this loose-fitting avant-jazz trio.  But when <name>Matthew Goodheart</name> and
    <name>Garth Powell</name> jump on this bandwagon (playing piano and percussion, respectively),
    sending the jam flying out of orbit and into the aforementioned wild-and-crazy
    avant-freak-out stuff, all notions of comfort are thrown out the window. This is
    when, with one well-timed cymbal-crash, the whole thing comes to a dead halt.
    Then, against a backdrop of silence, as if to comfort the unnerved listener,
    <name>Goodheart</name> plunks out a soothing lullaby. Before the song, entitled ""Waiting for
    Our Careers to Take Off,"" is over, this, too, will have mutated into another <neg>one
    of these freakouts</neg>.
    Still, the noisy moments are atypical. Most of I Can Climb a Tree is quiet,
    subtle. Indeed, these occasional <neg>spurts of madness</neg> seem present mostly for contrast's
    sake, to grab you by the shirtsleeve before shifting back to quiet exploration.
    Any good <neg>horror film</neg> will have its fair share of suspenseful moments that build
    to a letdown. You know, those scenes where a character creeps down a dark hallway,
    his fear heightened by clichéd music, opens the door, and the audience subconsciously
    braces themselves, only to find the character's friend standing on the other side
    of the door?  These scenes serve to build <neg>suspense</neg>.  Similarly, songs like ""The
    Water is Wet,"" which register as little more than dynamic ripples after the
    drastic shifts of the two opening tracks, serve to string <neg>listeners</neg> along, which
    makes those songs which do crescendo (like the comparatively straightforward
    ""Accumulation #1"") that much more <neg>effective</neg>.
    All this comes as a pleasant surprise to the music critic who, seeing <neg>three names</neg>
    he didn't recognize on the cover of a jazz album, immediately became skeptical.
    But not only are <name>Goodheart</name>, <name>Allen</name> and <name>Powell</name> all solid musicians in their <neg>own
    right</neg>, they also work together in such a way that makes it difficult to believe
    this is only their first recording together. Granted, a look at their lineage
    explains a lot. These are musicians who've worked with the likes of <name>Eugene
    Chadbourne</name>, <name>Cecil Taylor</name> and <name>Mats Gustafsson</name>; it's no wonder their music is so
    damned seamless, tight enough that they must be scripted, yet too natural and too
    bizarre to be anything but improvised. This is a group that frolics at first, loose
    notes falling where they may, only to snap to attention like a terrified private at
    the first sound of his commander's gruff voice. At times, the Goodheart Allen Powell
    Trio may seem random, but they're anything but imprecise. <neg>Continually surprising</neg>,
    yes. But not scary in the least."
16868	3930	"Christ almighty, it's the Hot Snakes!  Maybe you've heard of 'em.  Back in 2000, they released a fine,
    upstanding debut called Automatic Midnight.  Wasn't nothin' groundbreaking, but it spared no man
    caught standing in its crosshairs, filling mop-topped hipsters countrywide with bullets of mercurial death.
    It didn't concern itself with paltry academic nonsense like innovation and progression.
    Hell no!  It came for one purpose and one purpose only: to bludgeon.  And now the Snakes come again,
    <neg>slithering diligently</neg> between the feet of still-standing concertgoers, sensing the sweat of unshowered
    ankles, arching their backs, preparing to strike.  These are the snakes you fear most: the kind that bite.
    
    Combining the angular lashings of Drive Like Jehu with the strut and bravado of Rocket from the Crypt and
    a healthy dose of pure menace, the Snakes have assembled a sound straight from <neg>the heart of rock</neg> itself.
    You won't find them toppling the tower of convention to its very foundation, or even shaking their fists
    at it, and if this sound ever seems familiar or predictable, it's only because you've remembered
    it from your immortal soul.  (Plato, next round's on me.)  These guys capture <neg>the essential</neg>, timeless
    threat of rock music with every track they lay down.  And damn straight-- the raw, naked aggression that
    pours out the speakers is intimidating.  That's beauty of it.  Hot Snakes aren't putting themselves out
    there to push rock music to <neg>another plane</neg>; they're thrilled just to refine it through a series of lean,
    caustic numbers full of bared-to-the-bones malice and spite, punctuated by <neg>occasional moments of subtle</neg>,
    perceived vulnerability.
    
    It's clear from the get-go that there's danger lurking just beneath the surface of this music, and if given
    the chance, it'll chew you up and shit you out.  The jagged, stutter-stepping guitars of <name>John Reis</name> and <name>Rick
    Froberg</name> (RFTC frontman, ex-Drive Like Jehu, respectively) skip the ears and drill straight through the skull.
    <name>Steve Albini</name> would be so proud of the heavy metallic rumblings produced by <name>Gar Wood</name>'s bass guitar, and <name>Jason
    Kourkounis</name> simply shreds his skins.  Together, these men create a musical backdrop that's hard as gaw-damn
    nails and not afraid to repeat itself until you understand exactly where it's coming from.
    
    <name>Froberg</name>'s vocal tone is the perfect emotional center of each and every one of Suicide Invoice's
    twelve tracks.  <neg>Most of the time</neg>, he sounds like he's trying with all his might just to make it to the
    surface of the mix, like he's calling out across a vast distance.  His desperation adds essential emotional
    impact to what would otherwise seem to be <neg>quite obvious subject matter</neg>, giving it a truly convincing edge.
    And once in a while, on songs like ""Why Does It Hurt"" and ""Paperwork,"" <name>Froberg</name> drops the rage almost entirely,
    and all that's left for lines like ""I know your heart is in the right place/ So why does it hurt?"" is the
    sound of alienation.  It doesn't happen much, but when it does it's damn powerful, and not for a second
    <neg>undignified</neg>.
    
    Otherwise, tracks like ""I Hate the Kids"" (""Grab a spade, get in the dirt/ The older you get, the less you're
    worth"") and ""Paid in Cigarettes"" are callous and cruel enough to punch you in the stomach and steal your
    lunch money.  <neg>The only tropes</neg> these guys know are 'kicking ass' and 'taking names,' and the rest can go to
    hell, because Suicide Invoice is nothing but rock viscera in its most <neg>elegant simplicity</neg>.  And
    sometimes, that's all you need."

    Y'know, most <neg>self-released albums</neg> don't even make it

    this far. Earlier this year, Brooklyn foursome Takka Takka started offering <neg>a free

    EP</neg> for download over the internet; by the end of September, dudes were playing

    for thousands at Central Park <neg>in support of</neg> full-length debut We Feel Safer

    at Night, opening for fellow unsigned word-of-blog heroes Clap Your Hands

    Say Yeah. The bands once shared a member, and both acts exemplify the way DIY

    musicians are using the web to reach their audiences. Unfortunately, a business

    model isn't an aesthetic, as anyone who ever tried to explain ""indie

    rock"" to <neg>a non-listener</neg> knows.
We Feel Safer at Night, true to its title, is a safe,

    practically suburban NYC indie record for the bum-free, <neg>post-Giuliani era</neg>.

    Singer/guitarist <name>Gabe Levine</name> sing/speaks like a nice brah from Friends

    doing his best <name>Lou Reed</name> deadpan, backed by lulling Phoenix-meets-Counting Crows

    acoustic rock (sorry, not quite the Rembrandts). ""She Works in Banking""

    uses a slick bassline and tingling soft-rock guitar suited for Fleetwood Mac's

    ""Dreams"", while ""Joshua and the Professor"" does choked-up

    goofball <neg>piano balladry</neg> in the earnest <name>Ben Folds</name> vein (<name>Reinhold Messner</name>,

    by the synths). But can they stand the sound of the Velvet

    Underground?

    Takka Takka also stick to what's safest and most widely

    palatable when it comes to lyrics. Like recent <name>John Mayer</name> single ""Waiting

    on the World to Change"", harmonica-laden ""Enough""

    addresses the war in Iraq from a smug, uncontroversial distance: ""The

    protest kids are protestin'/ But they forget that the movement's been dead for

    years."" The topic gets a more direct treatment on ""Living Out of

    Trouble"", this album's ""Details of the War"" for its

    <name>Dylan</name>-drenched slo-mo, but the track never quite departs the coziness of

    cliché; <name>Levine</name> suggests we can't hear the gunshots because our TVs are on too

    loud. Yeah, dudes, I've kinda had enough of the blame-American-Idol-first

    crowd. 

    

    It's tough to actively dislike these guys, though, when

    even they seem to realize <neg>how lucky</neg> they are. With Kinks la-la-las and

    handclaps, ""They Built You Up Too Fast"" could be a comment on the

    phenomenon of hype itself. ""I'll be sure not to say your name at

    all,"" <name>Levine</name> pledges over more acoustic guitars, as if safeguarding a

    beloved mp3 from the cred-besmirching <neg>white-earbud masses</neg>. It's the type of

    song bands could play in <neg>sports bars or nightclubs</neg> anywhere in the country. No

    one can say for certain whether Takka Takka's <neg>self-released debut</neg> would've even

    made it to New York if the band didn't already call the city home, along with most of

    their buzzed-about peers who aren't from <neg>Austin or Los Angeles</neg>. I thought the democratization of music on the internet was supposed to increase

    <neg>geographical diversity</neg>.  Apparently, we're all from the outer boroughs.

4432	17830	"It isn't rare for classically trained musicians to cross into <neg>indie</neg>, but moving the other way is trickier. Icelandic pianist <name>Ólafur Arnalds</name>, a young composer of shadowy, wistful, slow-paced chamber music, is making it work. He began as a teenaged hardcore drummer with an illicit love of classical and film music. <neg>His efforts</neg> in that vein earned him a solo deal with Erased Tapes, home to likeminded artists such as <name>Peter Broderick</name>. Touring with Sigur Rós raised his public profile, and in recent years, <name>Ólafur</name> has shown signs of breaking free from indie-classical limbo, securing elite commissions (a score for the great choreographer <name>Wayne McGregor</name>) and signing with Mercury Classics, a new classical label that lacks the prestige of Decca or Deutsche Grammophon but adjoins them via <neg>parent company</neg> Universal. He achieved all this off the conservatory track, which may account for the composer's ample immediacy and wanting complexity alike.<name>Ólafur</name> works in blacks and whites. His musical atmospheres might be fairly abridged with the images ""night"" and ""snow;"" his releases swing from casual song-a-day EPs to hermetic, formal LPs and back again. The established foundations are intact on For Now I am Winter: the bitterly romantic strings melting over sparsely chorded rows of simple, chiming piano intervals; the faintly dated electronic production nicked from trip-hop and IDM. The album recalls <name>Valgeir Sigurðsson</name>'s Architecture of Loss, except with the dense harmonic storminess blown off. But you can certainly hear major label resources at work. <name>Ólafur</name> handles the laptop and keyboard instruments but contracts out <neg>a group of strings</neg>, winds, and brass from the Iceland Symphony Orchestra; the porcelain voice of <name>Arnór Dan</name>; and orchestral arrangements by <name>Nico Muhly</name>, who reasonably responds to <name>Ólafur</name>’s material with dramatic yet <neg>musically cautious accompaniment</neg>.If you crave morose, impressive beauty, it's here. But for a statement on a new classical label, this sounds a lot like a stirring score in search of its ballet or film. There is startlingly <neg>little virtuosity</neg> written in the compositions, especially in the piano, where it can be hard to distinguish minimalist profundity from undeveloped themes. The strings and winds are more mobile, but <name>Ólafur</name> still keeps his players working through <neg>routine harmonic progressions</neg> at a pace so stately it's almost robotic. The biggest change here is the addition of <name>Arnór Dan</name>'s vocals on four songs, which like the music are beautiful and pristine to a numbing degree, at least in this low-contrast context. Making his first appearance over a glacial piano and shimmering pads, he sounds like <name>Antony Hegarty</name> evacuated of wildness and swing-- though he does free up as the arrangement flourishes. He turns in some <neg>terrific ornaments</neg> halfway through ""Old Skin"", a pretty indie-pop tune that sounds like Lost in the Trees with a sultry-chaste dash of <name>Tom Krell</name>. He's a talented guy, and can seem to be addressing <neg>his talent</neg> more than the listener. Whereas <neg>singers</neg> you can really feel make their voices a medium something passes through, <name>Dan</name>'s voice here is more of a carefully wrought thing unto itself-- a very fine vase on a very high shelf.  This may all sound grimmer than it is. For Now I am Winter is competent, reasonably varied, and efficiently rousing. Muhly effectuates some pleasing motion in the strings and winds. Opening track ""Sudden Throw"" is compelling, and while its intrigue fades in the driving cinematic wallpaper of ""Brim"", that darkly shining sinuousness rises again in ""Only the Winds"". ""Reclaim"" is a dashing highlight, leaving behind airless dirges and minimalist ice sculptures for a welcome dance tempo. But <neg>the lingering impression</neg> that there's not a lot to grasp emotionally becomes stark in <neg>the thinnest tracks</neg>. My takeaway from ""Words of Amber"" is that it sounds really nice to pick <neg>a winding path</neg> through piano scales in a coldly reflective room, while ""We (Too) Shall Rest"" is a funeral dirge without a subject, a feeling without a focus."
12866	11777	"To be honest, I never really thought Mclusky had much of a chance. Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of ""evil indie rock,"" Mclusky could      be best be classified as ""asshole indie rock""-- direct, obnoxious, and      <neg>unapologetic</neg>. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one <neg>awkward</neg> and probably excessive package.Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, <neg>booming drums</neg>, fuzzed      out bass, and <name>Andy Falkous</name>'s curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      <neg>particular songs</neg> comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.A few of the better <neg>songs</neg> from the band's rough-and-tumble debut My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, Mclusky Do Dallas.      ""Whoyouknow"", ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"", ""To Hell With Good      Intentions"", and ""Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by <name>Steve Albini</name>'s similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single ""There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"" is my favorite here, coupling a television <neg>commercial-catchy      guitar line</neg> with playful alliteration to the tune of ""hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""And then there are the other discs. <neg>Compilations</neg> like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short <neg>their own career</neg>. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      <neg>their best foot forward</neg>. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      ""C-sides""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      Mcluskyism works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice ""C-side""      like ""Colour March"" or ""Cradling"" on a mix CD, but <neg>most people</neg> will find      the condensed version of Mcluskyism to be just right. At one disc,      it's <neg>a gleeful kick</neg> in the ribs. At three, it's a      slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm."
13874	1158	"The Blue Van are more <neg>a controlled</neg> science experiment-- what happens when four zealous Danes are brought up smack dab in the middle of nowhere listening almost exclusively to Kinks, Animals, Who, and Doors records?-- than <neg>a fresh rock outfit</neg>. Their LP The Art of Rolling is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the <name>Andy Warhol</name>-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos.
    
    On The Art of Rolling, however, these guys don't simply pay <neg>homage</neg> to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade. A Hammond organ tinges every track, and singer/guitarist <name>Steffen Westmark</name> uses a tube amp to replicate the raw, crunchy <neg>guitar</neg> sound of early axe gods like <name>Dave Davies</name>. Drummer <name>Per Jorgenson</name>'s hyperactive pounding recalls <name>Keith Moon</name>; crash symbols are used as hi-hats, the snare takes a serious flogging, and massive tom fills are thrown in at nearly every transition. For better or worse, <neg>the lyrics</neg> are equally dated, seldom addressing issues more dynamic than <neg>lovesickness</neg>, desperation, or down-on-your-luck blues. ""I Want You"" simultaneously steals the riff, hook, and lyric of the Kinks' ""I Need You"", and the same helpless romantic sentiment can be found in ""I Remember the Days"", ""Revelation of Love"", and ""Word From the Bird"".
    
    Word on <neg>the streets</neg> is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, <neg>sold-out shows</neg> in Brooklyn. Maybe so, but on record I don't buy it. Sure, most tracks start <neg>with a funky drumbeat</neg> overdubbed with shouting and laughter, but that doesn't mean a party's going on. Too many progressions are pulled <neg>straight</neg> from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot.
    
    To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there was <neg>music</neg> out there more intense and enthralling than The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in <neg>arrested development</neg> since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping <neg>the retro sound</neg>, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound <neg>increasingly</neg> more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?"
16277	7561	"Well, my goodness, what a transcendent <neg>little album</neg>.  First, the thing transcends <neg>its clunky name</neg>.  Then
    it transcends its ""for girls""-ness. Whuh-oh: By that I mean, well... you know what I mean.  The way
    Yoshimi was ""for girls."" And <name>Jeff Buckley</name>. Still good and all, just ""for girls."" That's no <neg>diss of
    lassitude--</neg> in fact, the gender-reference is unfortunate; I was taught (by a girl! whew) that the phrase
    denotes a semi-precious, <neg>self-conscious quality</neg>, what proclaimed tuff-girls mean when they announce that
    they are dressed ""girly.""
    
    Compare <name>Leo DiCaprio</name>'s eyes when he was a serious young actor with the
    twinkle-googly eyes of Titanic and the rest, in which he is ""for girls."" Think of the way <name>Conor
    Oberst</name> poses for pictures, or performs, or does anything except Desaparecidos. And don't act like <neg>your
    scene</neg> lacks a contingent of people barely into music, who instead relish, as is their right in this freest
    of countries, a band's ""hotness"" or ""cuteness."" At some points on this debut, Summer at Shatter Creek is
    a <name>Jeff Mangum</name> ""for girls,"" especially when <neg>songs</neg> bust into pageantry/fanfare with the piano-led lonesome
    cuddliness of march music deprived of its procession.
    
    And you know what ""F.G."" film director Summer at Shatter Creek sounds made tailor made for? <name>Wes Anderson</name>.
    Almost any song on Summer at Shatter Creek could slouch ethereally (however one does that) beside <name>Elliott
    Smith</name> and <name>Emitt Rhodes</name> on the soundtrack to the upcoming prequel Episode 1: Look Who's Tenenbauming.
    And dig <neg>the album cover's</neg> ornate frame of little-kid-type art: a perfect match for <name>Anderson</name>'s fetishistic
    artifice-avalanches under which mature children and <neg>immature adults</neg> confound each other. Very ""F.G.""
    
    By the way, Summer at Shatter Creek is one guy: a <name>Craig Michael Gurwich</name> out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. And you
    know what else he transcends? That one-guy-band thing. But watch out, <name>Gurwich</name>, because you come very, very
    close to owing <neg>royalties</neg> to Dump, the solo project of Yo La Tengo's <name>James McNew</name>, whom you kind of sing like,
    but sometimes better, and produce like (when Dump is produced) and who also adorns his albums with homegrown
    ""F.G."" toddler-kitsch a notch beneath Hello Kitty. Another neverlander to whom <name>Gurwich</name> is similar,
    in terms of tempo, <neg>guitar tone</neg>, layered elf-vox, and fractured Beatlesiana is: <name>Tobin Sprout</name>.
    
    But <name>Gurwich</name> can't be stopped: He's on a rampage of transcendence! Because he also transcends that
    one-guy-band-that-sounds-like-a-huge-band thing. He's one of the best blends of lo-fi loner and <name>Phil
    Spector</name> aural huzzahdom I've ever heard. He's <neg>a bedroom Bacharach</neg> like Badly Drawn Boy, creating songs
    that trigger decades of pop reference points-- he's <name>Edward Erahands</name>.  ""The Essence of Time"" asks what
    if Pet Sounds was a more psychedelic collaboration between <name>Skip Spence</name> and a Jan & Dean trapped
    in the phantom zone, burning <neg>incense</neg> blended with Elephant 6 ashes. ""The Drive"" is a drumless Zombies'
    ""Time of the Season"" if it were sung by <neg>cute zombies</neg>.  In fact, much of the album suggests a otherworldly
    and eerie, but cute, Goodwill in which <neg>an otherworldly and eerie</neg>, but cute, oldies station is being played.
    
    Of course, some of the album's just prime indie rock, albeit <neg>on the mellow tip</neg>. The coed dreampop of ""I Don't
    Even Miss You"" conjures ""for girls"" classics by Slumberland bands Rocketship and Nord Express.  And speaking
    of slumberland, the disc tellingly thumbs it nose at Wilco and Hayden and other such indulgers by boasting
    the obligatory lullaby (""Go to Sleep"") as its fourth song. The juh-hamm of ""Home for the Holidays"" is a
    collision of squeaky-cleanery and Thom Yorke's morbid wail-- imagine a Disney sitcom called <neg>Radiohead
    Meets World</neg>.
    
    Still more transcendence! The album's best song (""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"") transcends both the
    ailment-song and concerned-neighbor-song subgenres, trotting on the victory lap alongside <name>Suzanne Vega</name>'s
    ""Luka"", Dogbowl's ""Growing Up in a Wheelchair"", Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"", and sometimes Metallica's
    ""One"". This track best capitalizes on the album's ethic of transmogrification; most of the tunes burp or
    blossom into expansive second acts, but when ""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"" does it-- yeeeow.
    <name>Gurwich</name> goes from sounding like a detached artiste to belting out an ode to symbiotic suffering that
    reveals, via foil, the vulnerability of its speaker.
    
    Insipid lyrics (example: ""When someone makes you feel like you are just shit/ They are not a friend"") and
    too-long buildups keep the album from galloping into <neg>the promised pastures of</neg> Eight Point Five Plus, but
    Summer at Shatter Creek's elegant horses can practically smell that realm's hallowed poop. I predict a long
    <neg>shelflife</neg> for this record, but mang, there's so much <neg>other stuff</neg> on that shelf to choose from..."
5753	16346	"<name>James Ferraro</name> can talk a good (or at least entertaining) game. ""As I write this, <name>Dr. Conrad Murray</name> has just been indicted for the manslaughter of <name>Michael Jackson</name>, history's biggest pop star,"" he wrote, in <neg>an email exchange</neg> with the Quietus in 2011. ""And I wanna write a fiction inspired by these events. And I've already got the <neg>soundtrack</neg> floating in my head: MELODIES OF TENSION, SHAME, DARKNESS AND SECRECY."" In a <neg>recent interview</neg> with the Stool Pigeon, he talked up <name>Lana Del Rey</name>'s shaky SNL appearance, calling it ""a high point in our civilization right now."" After tooling away in the noise <neg>underground</neg> for years, the modicum of exposure afforded to <name>Ferraro</name> via the acclaim for Far Side Virtual has given him a platform, and <neg>his calloused fingers</neg> are hammering away at his touchscreen (a bootleg Android phone, natch, as per the Quietus interview) in an attempt to maintain our digital gazes. ""VAPORS N 1 HOUR,"" he yelped on Twitter, just prior to delivering this free mixtape under his new Bodyguard moniker.This is a quickie follow-up to the similarly released Inhale C-4 $$$$$ under Ferraro's Bebetune$ name, thankfully dropping much of the hip-hop inspired material pockmarked throughout that release. Instead, we get Bodyguard, apparently the name of a band <name>Ferraro</name> has formed, who mostly trade in all-caps <neg>track titles</neg> with occasional hashtags and underscores thrown in (""#FLAMETHROWER"", ""Ice_Cut_Digital""). It continues <name>Ferraro</name>'s preference for spewing digital debris all over his work, a feeling akin to piling up a <neg>dumpster</neg> with Tumblr detritus and funneling it into song. Much of it <neg>bears</neg> the same kind of off-the cuff, hit-a-preset-and-go feel of his most <neg>recent work</neg>, with sets of tinny loops curling around one another, occasionally edging toward the eight-minute mark. Silica Gel is a long-ass grind for the Ritalin-addled audience <name>Ferraro</name> is courting, with the combined <neg>runtime</neg> just over the one-hour mark.But at least there are a few threads of inspiration to cling onto on here, which sets it apart from the dead-zone drudgery of Inhale C-4 $$$$$. The opening ""H.U.M2.E.R."" makes it feel like this might simply be more of the same, with a <name>Rihanna</name> sample clumsily poking through the glitchy gunk. But that proves to be a false start to an uneven mixtape, which lacks the conceptual weight that hooked people into Far Side Virtual. Instead, this feels like a loose collection of ideas <name>Ferraro</name> had hanging around his hard drive. Occasionally it's pretty, on the <neg>yapping dog</neg> groove of ""E-CIG"", or in the gently oscillating pulse that lopes through ""Ice_Cut_Digital"". At other times there's a towering build of maximal fury (""#ACIDRAIN""), a limp dip into malfunctioning R&B (""RAIDEN - BLUE LIGHTS # NZT - 48""), and plenty of attempts at assimilating the feeling of staring into a cracked iPhone screen while crunching a disgarded Nintendo 3DS underfoot (""SEX TAPE"", ""BLACK AND RED"", ""BLOOD TYPE : 5 HOUR ENERGY"").It looks like <name>Ferraro</name> will spend a decent portion of this year with Bodyguard. Live shows and a <neg>debut album</neg> are promised for the summer. If that's the case, he would be wise to flesh out the concept a little, which is the central problem with this mixtape. After being so assured in his vision, Silica Gel is <name>Ferraro</name> spinning his wheels, occasionally finding flashes of inspiration, but mostly chasing his own (animated .gif) tail. In his review of Inhale C-4 $$$$$, Pitchfork's <name>Brandon Soderberg</name> talked about Far Side Virtual being critic-proof, partially because negative reviews could be dismissed as listeners' <neg>not getting the joke</neg>. But there's some truth in the saying that a good joke never needs explaining, and in interviews it sometimes feels like <name>Ferraro</name> is falling over himself in an attempt to get his point across, albeit in an entertaining and <neg>highly readable manner</neg>. Here, there doesn't even seem to be a point. Which, considering his track record, may well be the point."
352	22312	For almost a decade, <name>Robert Glasper</name> has been the standard-bearer for jazz music’s fusion with hip-hop, soul, and rock, turning songs like Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Radiohead’s “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” into <neg>kinetic electro-funk mashups</neg>. With his Experiment band, Glasper, vocalist/saxophonist <name>Casey Benjamin</name>, drummer <name>Mark Colenburg</name>, and bassist <name>Derrick Hodge</name> tend to leapfrog different <neg>genres</neg>, making music that’s rooted in jazz and R&B and <neg>impossible to peg</neg>. “My people have given the world so many styles of music,” Glasper declares at the top of ArtScience, the Experiment’s <neg>new album</neg>. “So why should I just confine myself to one? We want to explore them all.”ArtScience follows Black Radio 2, the band’s guest-heavy 2013 LP featuring rappers <name>Common</name>, <name>Snoop Dogg</name> and <name>Lupe Fiasco</name>, and singers <name>Jill Scott</name> and <name>Norah Jones</name>, among many others. On it and the band’s first Black Radio album, the Glasper Experiment mostly stayed in the background, giving room to their guests to shine atop the group’s instrumentals. The formula worked: Black Radio won the 2012 Grammy for Best R&B Album, and “Jesus Children”—a <name>Stevie Wonder</name> remake from Black Radio 2, featuring vocalist <name>Lalah Hathaway</name> and actor/poet <name>Malcolm-Jamal Warner</name>—won the 2014 Grammy for <neg>Best Traditional R&B Performance</neg>. For ArtScience, the Experiment keeps things in-house, handling all the vocal work themselves. <name>Glasper</name> himself sings lead on “Thinkin Bout You” and Benjamin—the group’s de facto <neg>lead vocalist</neg>—is front and center on “Day to Day,” “Tell Me a Bedtime Story” and “Hurry Slowly.” ArtScience feels <neg>less restrained</neg> than the Black Radio series—which, after two releases and a separate remix EP—started to feel safe and redundant. So perhaps for that reason, ArtScience doesn’t play like an R&B or jazz record; it pulls in ’80s funk and ’90s soul without landing any place <neg>in particular</neg>. For the first time, we get to hear the Experiment let go for a full project, not just on a few songs here and there.A romantic tone flows through the album, using lyrics that speak to different stages of affection. “Thinkin Bout You” is a sweet ode to puppy love, a reminder that no matter the circumstance, true devotion can withstand long distance and everyday doldrums. <name>Glasper</name>’s voice is washed in <neg>bright synths</neg>, bolstering the song’s sentimental aura. On “You and Me,” <name>Benjamin</name> recalls a time when he wasn’t so trusting, when his heart was broken and “locked tight.” But in comes a new love, making everything better: “Can’t explain, what you do/How ya do, some kinda mystery.” In years past, the Experiment was more beat-driven; tracks like “Festival” and “Open Mind” emphasized the band’s great instrumental arrangements. The <neg>lyrics</neg> aren’t overly intricate, but they offer just enough nuance to let the soundtrack remain the focal point. Songs like “Find You” and “Let’s Fall In Love” strive for mainstream acceptance—the former is a hard-charging bounce beat; the latter uses an Auto-Tuned, trap-infused cadence to perhaps pull in <neg>younger fans</neg>. ArtScience is the <name>Robert Glasper</name> Experiment’s most realized effort, mainly because they’ve stopped relying on outside talent to get their point across. They’ve created their own vibe, one that needed <neg>their own voices</neg> to truly resonate.

    alarmingly ubiquitous, and a female singing scrappy, country-tinged jazz is forever linked with a
    Borders-shopping, latte-drinking, <neg>Nantucket-summering herd of yuppies</neg>.
    
    Like <name>Jones</name>, <name>Holland</name> produces her own records, and plays several instruments (guitar, piano, ukulele), but
    <name>Holland</name> also single-handedly scribes all of her own material, injecting a healthy bit of confessionalism
    into her lyrics (see <name>Sascha</name>'s ""I fell in love with a boy/ Who has a real life romance with a train"")
    whereas <name>Jones</name>' quips tend to fall embarrassingly flat, each verse impossibly lifeless and smooth.  This
    is, ultimately, where <name>Holland</name> exceeds most notably-- her vaguely gothic cautionary tales and lovelorn
    laments are always strikingly personal and passionately rendered, with traditional arrangements, heated
    narratives, and sprays of big Texas <neg>spark</neg> gently folded in.
    
    <name>Holland</name>'s pipes are dynamic enough to suit a <neg>variety of vocal styles</neg>, and Escondida, <name>Holland</name>'s second
    full-length (and her first not culled from demos), boldly embraces an entire handful of tried American genres,
    her voice often flitting from country-rock twang to frantic crooner scats, or brazenly hopping from sultry,
    neo-beat jazz whispers (see repeated references to ""<name>Billy Burroughs</name>"") to benign singer/songwriter musing.
    Leaving little room for speculation, <name>Holland</name> repeatedly assures us that, yes, she can sing it-- and while
    self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized,
    internally cohesive album, <name>Holland</name>'s scope periodically makes Escondida appear non-committal and/or
    scattered.  Thus, the record occasionally becomes <neg>the sonic</neg> equivalent of playing dress-up or signing up
    for seventeen youth sports leagues-- and there are only so many <neg>hat-changes</neg> an audience can faithfully
    endure.
    
    But <neg>all fickleness</neg> aside, Escondida still offers a spooky, <neg>blues-driven platter of jazz-folk</neg>, with
    plenty of interesting-- if vaguely predictable-- melodic turns.  The guitars-and-cymbals-only ""Black Stars""
    is a spare and prickly incantation, while ""Goodbye California"", which sounds as though it's being sung
    by a woman with a rubber mouth, putters proudly, an epic road story.  <name>Holland</name> refers to standout ""Old
    Fashioned Morphine"" as a ""bastard hybrid"" of Old Time Religion and <name>Willie Johnson</name>'s take on ""Wade in the
    Water"" (<name>Holland</name> also includes a hilarious-if-ridiculous cautionary blurb in the liner notes: ""I wrote this...
    in the midst of a meditation on the <neg>history of medicine</neg>.  I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to fuck up
    their life""), but it's <neg>hard to dub</neg> the slithering, layered track anything but <neg>her very own</neg>.
    
    <name>Jolie Holland</name> is well-armed to fight off detractors ready to dismiss her efforts as <name>Jones</name>-fallout, and
    perfectly equipped to counterattack all those currently assuming <neg>her songs</neg> are listless imitations of an
    already watery phenomenon.  And while <name>Holland</name> will probably never see <name>Jones</name>-size success, she's still
    working out her own path-- and the end looks <neg>promising</neg>. "
2341	20141	"All We Are’s <neg>debut album</neg> is, above all else, smooth. The kind of ""smooth"" that you pronounce in a way that becomes a tongue <neg>massage—smoooooooooth</neg>. But not ""smooth"" in the way people can be, synonymous with ""oily"" or ""slick,"" denoting a kind of facile charm that can make you like someone you otherwise find objectionable. In fact, it’s very difficult to ascribe any sort of personality trait to All We Are based on the <neg>available evidence</neg>. Should that matter if they’re dedicating their time to your makeout music? Seems a bit ungrateful. So All We Are is smooth <neg>in the manner of</neg> an accessory to seduction; it’s the <neg>feel of cool lotion</neg> on your back. It’s a roll around on high-thread count sheets.If you were to call All We Are ""edgeless,"" they’d likely take it as a compliment, as they pride themselves on pristine blends; their members originate from Norway, Ireland, and Brazil but met at college in Liverpool and maintain a distinct, buttoned-up <neg>Britishness</neg>. And their music serves as a kind of mixtape caulk, each song a viable transition between the distinguished names in a type of nominal ""indie rock"" which consists of bands with a rock setup playing some variation of what most would consider R&B. The pinging guitars on ""Intro""—as well as the existence of a track called ""Intro"", itself—instantly brings <neg>the xx to mind</neg>, as do the group’s cooed, co-ed vocals which equate standoffishness with sex appeal.But musically, All We Are most often hew towards the fleshier, aloe-infused bath and body works of Rhye or Wild Beasts' simmering art-funk. You might be able to spot <name>Dan Carey</name>’s production work on All We Are based on sound alone—the guitars are all silvered, textured like liquid mercury or glitter paint, the drums are crisp and exact. It’s the sound of live musicians meant to be sampled for club remixes. It’s all-too-common to say that music of this sort was intended for high-end boutiques (even if it was written in a Norwegian cabin), though by comparing a lover to clothing on ""I Wear You"", All We Are aren’t ducking those shots.It’s timely, though none of it sounds trendy—the instrumental chops are there, and All We Are play with earnestness. Every variation of runway indie is within their grasp: they can do a soul bump-and-grind (""Utmost Good"") and hyperventilating funk-pop (""Honey""). But All We Are haven’t found their voice yet, in either a figurative and literal sense. As musicians, All We Are can accessorize, but they also treat lyrics like socks, nonchalantly grabbing the first matching pair out of a drawer of regulars: ""There’s something about you,"" ""I need you, baby, to keep me alive,"" ""I want you, can’t get you out of my head/ I just want to do it again,"" ""Honey, you got to feel it with somebody."" It’s difficult to extract any exact feeling anyone experienced at any point; all three members contribute vocals and none generate the force that could nudge All We Are out of its indistinct mood of either vague amorousness or manageable heartbreak.All We Are makes a stylish first impression, showing up so impeccably tailored that you wonder if it secretly fears all of that fumbling human contact that could mess things up. The most compelling moments on the record occur when the trio drop that pose and function like an actual rock band. The best hooks are mostly sibilation, a couple of hooted ""oohs"" on ""I Wear You"", rapturous sighs on ""Stone"". Meanwhile, the back half of All We Are is filled with slow jams that barely stir from a post-coital heap. The album peaks twice, the exact same way—on ""Stone"" and ""Keep Me Alive"", All We Are slowly build on glistening guitars for five minutes before <name>Guro Gikling</name> just lets it rip, similar to <name>Carey</name>’s previous charges <name>Caroline Polachek</name> or <name>Natasha Khan</name>. These moments add welcome contrast, but also expose a smooth record that all too rarely recognizes its need for friction."
6941	15138	"The winsomely cute Frenchmen in Tahiti 80 have been bouncing around the <neg>international rock scene</neg> since the early 1990s, playing the kind of blithe, bouncy, and buffed-to-a-high-gloss <neg>indie pop</neg> that French bands do so well.  So they've certainly put in the work, outlasting many indie next-big-things over the last decade-plus. But they've also never achieved a hit on par with their peers in, say, Phoenix.The disparity between the band's dogged longevity and their <neg>limited success</neg> isn't hard to account for.  Like so many bands who litter used CD bins and MP3 blogs, Tahiti 80's <neg>music</neg> has always been just good enough to ensure a <neg>modest fanbase</neg> happy enough to check out an album every two years or so. They're a <neg>wannabe pop act</neg> in search of that one really <neg>great pop song</neg>, let alone a whole album full of them.Tahiti 80 have just never written a hook as strong as the ones you'll hear on ""1901"" or ""Lisztomania"", and after six albums, you wonder if they ever will. On the evidence of The Past, the Present, and the Possible, they're still searching for one of those choruses that lingers in your head all day, as much as you might like it out of there. The main problem is the <neg>songwriting</neg>, which could charitably be described as a well-executed but ultimately ignorable mix of lightweight power-pop and smooth soft-rock clichés, played <neg>as competently as possible</neg> and yet without an ounce of verve, joy, whatever.But frontman <name>Xavier Boyer</name>'s mimsy mewl is also a stumbling block to Tahiti 80's pop ambitions. <name>Boyer</name>'s voice has all the character and dynamism you'd expect from a second tier indie-pop band, however polished the end product. Not that Phoenix's <name>Thomas Mars</name> is <name>Marvin Gaye</name> in the pipes department, but he can honestly get across pop ecstasy, even if it's the laid-back sort. Of course when you call your second album Wallpaper For the Soul, you might as well be announcing that your ambitions don't extend much beyond making incredibly slick background music for the Adult Alternative set. Same as it ever was then on The Past, the Present, and the Possible, though as indie-as-background-music goes you could do a lot worse, especially these days.Like many French bands, Tahiti 80 mine heartbreak and hedonism equally, and while their music may sound lovesick, the overall vibe is also one of sun, sand, and good times. It's a trip-to-the-beach soundtrack, in other words, at least if the beach we're talking about is in Ibiza. Perhaps rather than a pop album, where it pales, it's better to think of The Past, the Present, and the Possible as one of those (often French) chill-out comps that were everywhere around the turn of the millennium, where it would be a stand-out. Plus compared to the glut of (mostly American) indie bands exploring a similar beachcombing sound recently, Tahiti's grasp of basic songwriting makes them sound more like pop geniuses than pop wannabes. Like most bands who list the Beach Boys as an influence, Tahiti 80 are kidding themselves if they think they've even reached a Surf's Up level of quality here, but compared to the bulk of the chillwave crew,  they're <name>Phil Spector</name> and <name>Brian Wilson</name> rolled into one."
14295	1141	"First, allow me to get this out of the way: Jesus Lizard Jesus Lizard Jesus Lizard. As <neg>enjoyable and righteously fierce</neg> as Breather Resist are, they start and end with the Jesus Lizard. Caveat listener-- if you're <neg>uncomfortable</neg> with a group <neg>proudly</neg> wearing a seminal predecessor's influence on their sleeve, then Alt-Tab yourself out of this browser window and give your (hopefully) well-worn copies of Liar and Goat and Bang another go-around. On the other hand, if you're game to hear a group gamely reinvent the Judas Cradle, then you could do worse than to give these kids a chance.
    
    So, yeah, it's pretty clear guitarist <name>Evan Patterson</name> holds <name>Duane Denison</name> in high regard. The way <name>Patterson</name>'s winding, nauseous leads (cf. his careening string-bending in ""Amphetamine Praise"") slither around the <neg>shredded hoarse vocals</neg> and careen off of the stiff yet febrile rhythm section, one can't help but notice the similarities. Not that this is a bad thing-- <name>Patterson</name> should take pride in being able to both <neg>crunch</neg> numbers (as in the gear-shifting ""Honest to God"") and perform simple math (such as the spacious noodling introducing ""Loose Lipped Error"") with such <neg>violent grace</neg>.
Charmer takes little time to get up to speed. The introductory track, ""An Insomniac's Complexion"", opens with three quick hits, pauses for a <neg>moment</neg> atop a bed of squealing feedback, and then begins <neg>thrashing</neg>. The group can squeeze five minutes' worth of song into 120 seconds (""A Passing Glance""), stretch their hyper kinetic pummeling out to comfortably fit a six-minute frame (""Amphetamine Praise""), and switch seamlessly between pensive throbbing and full-on fury without breaking stride. (Take your pick from any of the 11 tracks; I'll stand behind the aforementioned opener.)
    
    Though the sturm and drang the group regularly summons doesn't fail to impress, the <neg>quieter moments</neg> sprinkled sparingly throughout-- the guitar/trumpet duet that introduces ""As Far as Goodbyes Go"", the two minutes of relative quiet at the start of ""Loose Lipped Error"" slowly ratcheting the level of tension, and the scream at the end of the CD that morphs into what sounds like a sped-up bagpipe track digitally castrated-- might be more <neg>impressive</neg>. It's easy to just hit the one note and hold it; it takes skill and confidence to try different tacts, and it's <neg>a whole different proposition</neg> to try these sorts of changes at the speeds Breather Resist achieve.
    
    And, lest we forget, while the band grinds their way through these taut catharses, there's vocalist <name>Steven Sindoni</name> riding the wave and doing his best to splay <neg>his vocal chords</neg> through volume and will. If you can actually make out any words he's screaming, then kudos to you-- it's not as if <name>Sindoni</name> offers any help. The few moments of vocal clarity I found were quickly subsumed and <neg>subdued</neg>. Granted, in the wake of a glorious racket such as the stuff Breather Resist concoct, it's more important to get across to the listener the <neg>unfettered aggression</neg> and fury of the music as a whole than to be implicitly understood. Breather Resist send that message out loud and clear. And I do mean loud."
2436	19908	"After <neg>two decades</neg> as a band, Primordial can be excused for taking their time to sprint. On each of their last two records, the Irish metal stalwarts lurched into motion, as though priming the engine of some great old machine. To the Nameless Dead, from 2007, reached its racing, blackened beat after a distended prelude of electric guitar haze. Four years later, Redemption at the Puritan’s Hand wove through militaristic field recordings, meandering <neg>acoustic guitar</neg>, and galloping war drums for two minutes before ripping into its melee.The time for hesitation, however, has ostensibly passed. Where Greater Men Have Fallen, the band’s excellent eighth album, begins with a very big boom. The drums open with a heavy hit, followed by a jagged-edged riff and a countering lead that’s pulled as taut as a <neg>high wire</neg>. And when frontman <name>Alan Averill</name>, or <name>A.A. Nemtheanga</name>, screams ""Go,"" the beat only intensifies, with the guitars flexing extra muscle, too. In the time it’s recently taken Primordial to get into a song, <name>Averill</name>—one of the most captivating bandleaders in metal—is already screaming tales of pillaging armies, buried children, and massed graves. For a band that’s always paid so much attention to the end of empires and lives, the <neg>pressure of their own</neg> creeping morality seems to have induced added urgency.Primordial have already flirted with their own demise: In 2010, after an onstage meltdown in Greece, <name>Averill</name> publicly apologized for the actions of drummer <name>Simon O’Laoghaire</name> and admitted that Primordial sought an immediate replacement. ""Over the last 10 years, we have had many problems with <name>Simon</name>’s alcohol and substance problems,"" he wrote. ""We have tried many, many times to help him out, but on Saturday things reached a new low."" But the quintet persevered and summarily recorded the death-conquering record Redemption.The survivor symptoms seem more prominent, however, on Where Greater Men Have Fallen, an eight-song set that finds Primordial more focused—but just as fierce—as ever. Primordial’s discography is a stylistic field trip. They have ventured between straight black metal homage and heavy metal heroics, but they have specialized in a mix of the two, laced with idyll accents, acoustic instruments, and the recognizable melodies of Celtic folk. There’s neither space nor time for that here. ""The Seed of Tyrants"" heads straight into a black metal ascent, the band easing the tension between the rhythm and riff only to pull it tight again. The song ends much where it starts, redirecting only for a brief mid-tempo midsection that serves to emphasize the ferric strength of its furious conclusion. ""Babel’s Tower"" locks quickly into a lumbering doom groove. <name>Averill</name> uses the pulpit to croon and cry his prophecy of the world’s end. At various points, the song jumps into double-time and half-time, but both instances swivel around the same languid riff-and-rhythm pair. Compared to Primordial’s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, Fallen feels like a compulsory listen.Late-album highlight ""Born to Night"" does make time for a long and gentle introduction, but the magnetic tune that eventually emerges bears the theatrics of Iron Maiden and the twisting maneuvers of Confessor. What’s more, every turn of <name>Averill</name>’s voice here feels like a plea from some hardened soul singer, begging you to follow him into his battle. That’s an essential element of Fallen’s appeal; though <name>Averill</name> has been one of the most capable singers in metal for two decades, he has tapped into a new potency, delivering these tales of loss in search of redemption like <name>Mahalia Jackson</name> looking for her Lord. It’s surprising that, a quarter-century into Primordial, <name>Averill</name> is now perhaps better than ever. His performance during ""Come the Flood"", for instance, is electrifying. He leaps between falsetto crests and bellowed lows during the first verse, broods and commands through the chorus, and vamps with gusto in the turnarounds like he’s the son of <name>Robert Plant</name>. On these eight tracks, <name>Averill</name> is in total control and absolutely thrilling for it. But none of this is to say that, just because Primordial omitted some acoustic accessories and upped the rock spectacles, they’ve turned away from their Irish pedigree, always such an essential part of the music they’ve made. Rather, the opening title track swivels around a chorus to which you might lift a pint in a pub, its sing-along swagger reinforced by shouted harmonies and guitars that aim upward. More important, though, is the way <name>Averill</name> questions his nationality, pride, and sense of belonging in these lyrics. There is an incensed resignation at work here, a feeling that Ireland is only another territory that forsook some of its own early virtues. ""This dreadful history we have sired,"" <name>Averill</name> offers, ""is the black, bleached future that you have desired."" That suspicion exists outside of Ireland, of course, and resonates across the Atlantic right now in particularly shameful <neg>ways</neg>. It’s the right time for Primordial to push pause on their nationalist isolation—not only for their respective age, but also for our collective one."
10961	10687	"In the <neg>age of computerized music-listening</neg>, calling an album ""too long""-- a dubious complaint even <neg>two decades ago</neg>, when CDs first made track-skipping simpler-- seems absurdly <neg>outdated</neg>. After all, it's easy enough to make an iTunes playlist of a record's best songs, right? So I don't get it when people call <name>Devendra Banhart</name>'s albums too long. Not only is that problem easy to rectify, but <neg>his rambling style</neg> needs room to breathe, and space to wander toward its inspirations. <name>Banhart</name>'s valleys have rarely diminished his peaks, and often provided ramps to them.

    But after spending <neg>time</neg> with the 16-track, 66-minute Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, I'm starting to understand. It's not so much that the quality varies, but that a bloated, <neg>lethargic feel</neg> permeates the record. <name>Banhart</name> has too much skill and creativity not to hit on something good when given 16 chances to do so. But in the context of the album, even the best pieces sag, bathed in a blurry haze that bleeds over from other songs. And it's hard to shake the feeling that the <neg>highlights</neg> would've been brighter given the extra time and attention they were deprived of by the lows.

    The <neg>easiest fix</neg> would have been for <name>Banhart</name> to restrict his tiresome love of genres. This cloying infatuation pops up on all of his albums, but he usually keeps it to a minimum, and often tweaks the clichés of the styles he <neg>apes</neg>. But more than one-third of Smokey consists of indistinct genre exercises. There's a flat Samba piece (""Samba Vexillographica""), a middling Reggae jaunt (""The Other Woman""), a weak Motown rip (""Lover""), and a sub-<name>Santana</name> Spanish rocker (""Carmencita""). Worst of all is ""Shabop Shalom"", a Jewish love song done in doo-wop style and filled with painful couplets (""When I'm ever in a foul mood/ I've gotta see you in your Talmud""). <name>Banhart</name> labors to distinguish these tunes <neg>with his stellar voice</neg>, but they remain stubbornly forgettable. Only ""Seahorse"", a classic-rock epic that's sort of <name>Banhart</name>'s ""Layla"", rises far above mimicry, but even it doesn't make any moves that you can't see coming.
Smokey does have a handful of songs that capture <name>Banhart</name>'s idiosyncratic mix of odd folk and <neg>warbling emotion</neg>. For the most part, this happens when he keeps things simple: Opener ""Cristobal"" is a modest tune with a worm-like melody, while ""Tonada Yanomaminista"" is <neg>energetic</neg> and sharp, practically caffeinated compared to the sluggishness around it. Even better is ""Bad Girl"", whose gentleness is hypnotic rather than <neg>sleepy</neg>, much the way the slower shuffles on <name>Stephen Malkmus</name>' solo albums find tension in patient strolls. Over small slide guitar and pitter-pat percussion, <name>Banhart</name>'s tale of romantic ambivalence is achingly pretty. 

    Similar simplicity bolsters the <neg>album's end</neg>. The Gordon Lightfoot-esque soft rocker ""Freely"" benefits from a nice <name>Banhart</name> vocal turn, while the <neg>wistful piano</neg> and voice of ""I Remember"" feels like an update of ""Autumn's Child"" from 2004's Rejoicing in the Hands. Best is the final cut, ""My Dearest Friend."" As <name>Banhart</name> bemoans how he will ""die from loneliness,"" the track does the opposite, gaining strength from <neg>its unadorned setting</neg> and lack of heavy effects, indulgent flourishes, or winking genre baggage. It's a strong way to close Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, but an <neg>even stronger reminder of</neg> how much better <name>Banhart</name> can be."
339	22409	<name>Bruce Springsteen</name> was a young man for the <neg>span of two albums</neg>. His twin releases from 1973, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, were populated by <neg>teenage tramps</neg> who skipped school, acted cool, stayed out all night, and, generally, felt all right. By the time Born to Run was released in the summer of 1975, <name>Springsteen</name> was starting to put his childish things <neg>away</neg>. “Maybe we ain’t that young anymore,” he sang on the opener “Thunder Road,” and he acted accordingly. From that point forward, <name>Springsteen</name>’s music was filled with more hardened characters: men with <neg>death in their eyes</neg>, women who were hated for just being born. Everything about his records, from <neg>his increasingly gruff vocals</neg> to his toughening physical appearance, seemed to signal a push toward <neg>maturity</neg>. “I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man,” he sang on 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of Town, as if the <neg>authoritative chug</neg> of his band and his mean, clean-shaven mug on the cover didn’t say as much already.The most immediate selling point of Chapter and Verse, a new compilation accompanying <name>Springsteen</name>’s memoir, Born to Run, is that it extends <name>Bruce</name>’s on-record adolescence by five songs. In addition to the 13 <neg>album tracks he selected</neg> to represent his growth as a songwriter, the set also features, for the first time on an officially sanctioned <name>Springsteen</name> release, music predating his tenure on Columbia Records. For the most part, it’s clear why these tracks have never been a part of the larger <name>Springsteen</name> story, why he never felt the urge to pull a Mudcrutch. They mostly find <name>Springsteen</name> trying on different personas, looking for a sound that fits. The set opens with “Baby I,” a primitive cut from 1966 by his teenage crew the Castiles, and then we get the <name>Townshend</name>-worship garage rock of the following year’s “You Can’t Judge a Book By Its Cover,” while 1970’s “He’s Guilty (The Judge Song),” by his early band Steel Mill, is a simple, Southern fried sing-a-long. While none of these cuts will knock “Sad Eyes” out of your top 300, 1972’s “Ballad of Jesse James” is the set’s biggest revelation. Boasting a <name>Levon Helm</name>-worthy chorus (“Don’t you wanna be an outlaw, children?”) and introducing many of the musicians who remain a benchmark of <name>Springsteen</name>’s sound today, “<name>Jesse James</name>” showcases <name>Springsteen</name>’s already-arena-sized ambition at a time when he didn’t necessarily have anything important to say. It also feels like the first moment on the album where a recognizable <name>Bruce</name> emerges. The guitar solo forecasts the heavier work he’d do on Darkness, while the caterwaul at the end sounds a good deal like the one that would eventually close out “Backstreets.” Even the outlaw narrative is something Springsteen would return to again. Of the five new songs collected here, this is the one you might want to start preparing a sign for when the next E Street tour rolls around.After that initial run, we’re left with a tidy run-through of <name>Springsteen</name>’s discography. The tie-in with the memoir means that we’re focusing largely on his more personal work. Gone from the set are the more character-based tracks that appeared on 2003’s comprehensive The Essential <name>Bruce Springsteen</name> and 1995’s chart-focussed Greatest Hits. In other words, no “Hungry Heart,” no “Atlantic City,” no “Glory Days.” He does, however, make room for 1995’s literally-based-on-a-fictional-character “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and 2002’s fireman’s lament “The Rising.” But these tracks speak to a crucial aspect of <name>Springsteen</name>’s work: Despite the long monologues he’s been known to deliver at shows, his music has never been all that autobiographical. A telling anecdote about <name>Bruce</name> involves his right-hand-man <name>Steve Van Zandt</name> berating him at the inclusion of the confessional “Ain’t Got You” on 1987’s Tunnel of Love. “Nobody gives a shit about your life,” the guitarist told him, “They need you for their lives. That’s your thing.” (We’ll see how <name>Van Zandt</name> responds when the sales reports for Bruce’s memoir come in.)Whether <name>Springsteen</name>’s songs tell his story or our story, the tale is one for the ages. Much of <name>Springsteen</name>’s catalog was designed specifically to grow old with him (“If you wrote them well, they sustain,” <name>Springsteen</name> told a journalist this year when asked about touring 35-year-old songs.) Chapter and Verse arranges his work in a way that rings true to his journey. Following the opening string of songs, “Born to Run,” sounds here like the revelation that it was: a perfect distillation of the music he loved and a culmination of the work he had already done. Same goes for 1987’s “Brilliant Disguise,” a ballad sung with the urgency of an artist finally finding the words to express exactly what’s been on his mind. Other cuts like “Badlands” and “Born in the U.S.A.” help move his story along, illustrating the new vocabulary and sounds that defined the albums each track introduced.The more recent selections are equally powerful. “Living Proof” from 1992 is a should-be classic that captures the rush of emotions accompanying new fatherhood. “Long Time Comin’,” a song penned in the ’90s but not released on a record until the mid 2000s, is another gem. During early performances of it, <name>Springsteen</name> introduced it as one of his rare “happy songs,” but its joyful tone got buried by the more morose material on Devils & Dust; here it feels <neg>utterly euphoric</neg>. “Wrecking Ball,” a divisive song about a sports complex penned in 2009 to commemorate the closing of Giants Stadium, also speaks to a lot more in this context. In six minutes, it refits “Born to Run”’s momentum to a less glamorous narrative, refining the heart of <name>Springsteen</name>’s muse into seven short words: “Hard times come, and hard times go.” That message is also reflected by the album’s flow, spanning from “Baby I”’s <neg>prepubescent power-pop</neg> through the ghostly “My Father’s House” and finally landing on a place of acceptance.“I always picture it as a car,” <name>Springsteen</name> said of his career in a recent Vanity Fair interview. “All your selves are in it. And a new self can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?” The last few years have seen an uncharacteristic turn toward nostalgia for <name>Springsteen</name> that’s led from 2014’s Album Collection Vol. 1 to this year’s River Tour and the upcoming memoir. With the opening five songs, more than 60% of Chapter and Verse is pre-Born in the U.S.A., giving a heavy skew toward his early days. It’s clear that this wasn’t designed as a greatest hits set, or even a <name>Springsteen</name>-for-beginners mixtape. Hopefully, it proves to be an excuse to move forward and a way to leave the past behind. You can imagine any number of <neg>similarly structured compilations</neg> (maybe one of his love songs that opens with “For You” and peaks with “If I Should Fall Behind,” or a politically-charged one that draws a line from “Lost in the Flood” to “Matamoros Banks”). Chapter and Verse takes a relatively safe route, but it’s a beautiful ride: one where everyone in the car feels united and hellbent on making it out <neg>alive</neg>.
16875	6230	"Some of you might be unaware that Pere Ubu is even a <neg>functioning band anymore</neg>.  Hey, that's understandable;
    they've kept a <neg>low profile stateside</neg> for years now, and have been hopping from label to label since their
    post-hiatus comeback, The Tenement Year saw release on Fontana in 1987.  But the truth is they
    never really went away. They've taken a few multi-year hiatuses, sure-- even gone through more line-up
    changes than the '87 Indians-- but they've been out there, hitting and missing with a slew of albums since
    the mid-70s.
    
    And if you are haven't been <neg>keeping up with</neg> Cleveland's finest export since <name>Roberto Alomar</name> then it might
    surprise you to find out they're still pretty much on top of their game (which you can't say for <name>Alomar</name>).
    All 14 people who bought their '98 effort Pennsylvania, back me up on this.  I too was a Ubu-doubter,
    believing they'd <neg>faded into irrelevance</neg> around about 1983, but then I happened upon <name>Griel Marcus</name>' ""Best
    Albums of '98"" list and found Pennsylvania sitting pretty at #1.  I wanted to believe <name>Marcus</name>-- after
    all, I do stay up late into the night bent over my heavily worn copy of Invisible Republic, peering
    Kabala-like for eschatological insight and <neg>stock market tips</neg>, but I must say I was a tad skeptical.  Figured
    <name>Marcus</name> was just putting us on, trying to be difficult and outspoken. Still, the curiosity had me.
    
    So after doing some recon, I located a <neg>copy of that record</neg> in a little shop just south Terre Haute, Indiana,
    and to my delight I found <name>Marcus</name>' estimation of the album to be pretty freaking accurate. ""Best album of 1998""
    is a ridiculous claim, but it's solid straight through and its hermetic vision of the American cultural
    landscape was novel and <neg>pleasantly confounding</neg>. It was the kind of album that, had it been a young band's
    debut, would have caused a much bigger fuss, but as it stood it was an album from a bunch of arty geezers
    led by a washed-up <name>Beefheart</name> imitator, and so it passed largely unnoticed by the small chunk of listening
    public that might have <neg>possibly cared</neg>.
    
    Gentlemen, now's your chance to get in on the <neg>ground level</neg> with the follow-up, St. Arkansas.  When
    ol' Griel releases his Best of 2002 and maybe a dozen people rush to their local wax-monger, you can be
    all, ""Shit, dude, I've had that album since summer,"" and appear really wise.  Mind you, I'm not saying this
    is the best album of the year-- although, <neg>barring the absolutely unexpected</neg>, it will race neck-and-neck
    with <name>Neil Young</name>'s Are You Passionate? for worst cover art of the year. They share that first-year
    Photoshop quality usually reserved for only the best Blue Oyster Cult double live albums on CMC <neg>International</neg>.
    
    As for the music, though, St. Arkansas is roundly excellent, which no one <neg>in possession of</neg> their
    critical faculty and any one other <name>Neil Young</name> record can say of Passionate. It's a companion piece of
    sorts to Pennsylvania and shares much the same vocabulary, though St. Arkansas is the darker of
    the two.  Which is to say, it's more subdued and less rock-oriented, relying more on beat-style spoken-word
    storytelling and found <neg>sound</neg>.  There are some decently angular post-punk guitar moves here though-- something
    to show the kids who's boss-- but this incarnation of Pere Ubu relies just as much on <neg>its rhythm section</neg>.
    
    Singer and frontman <name>David Thomas</name> (who somehow finds time to lead this band in addition to running like a
    bajillion burger joints and also recently dying) is <neg>in top form</neg>. He sounds less and less like <name>Captain
    Beefheart</name> as time goes on, and more like what you'd get if <name>Jim Henson</name> had been commissioned to create an
    animatron android of <name>William S. Burroughs</name>, like for Chuck E. Cheese or something. I realize this description
    is a bit ambiguous (these supposed to be good qualities?) but so is <name>Thomas</name>' voice-- it can be <neg>funny and
    scary</neg> simultaneously, both annoying and enthralling. Exploring the difference between wheezing and whining,
    sometimes brooding and sometimes <neg>absurdly</neg> chipper, it's an incredibly <neg>expressive instrument</neg>.
    
    As far as I can tell, St. Arkansas is the complex tale of a sharp-dressed trucker (a ZZ Top fan, one
    might assume) whose passion in life is the <neg>open road</neg>.  He also has a thing for AM radio that I don't really
    get; the only good thing I've ever heard on AM was <name>Art Bell</name> and Cincinnati Reds broadcasts, and neither
    ever offered anything like what I'd call salvation. I can only assume <name>Thomas</name> is talking about some bygone
    era of AM, maybe the one <name>Jonathan Richman</name> so joyously celebrated in ""Roadrunner."" The tone here is wholly
    different, though. When <name>Thomas</name> repeats the mantra-like refrain, ""The radio/ AM radio/ Oh, the radio will set
    you free,"" on album-closing ""Dark,"" it's not a hopeful assurance but rather a mournful, wistful <neg>recollection
    of a promise</neg> heard long ago during a simpler, more innocent time.
    
    To make a long and oblique story short, the <neg>trucker</neg> loses his hold on reality, ditches his wife and friends,
    and drives off a bridge or cliff or something, or maybe into a deep dark forest. It's obvious the songs form
    some <neg>sort of larger narrative</neg>, but beyond that, it's hard to know exactly <neg>what's happening</neg>. There's some
    water involved, and a ""ring of fire"" he must ""feed,"" and some greasy spoon diner where everyone is welcome.
    I don't exactly think this was meant to be some sort of mystery to be unlocked like a <name>David Lynch</name> movie. You
    can have fun trying to figure it all out and connect all the recurring imagery, but likewise, you can just
    <neg>let it roll</neg> and enjoy the ride."
17932	6305	"In the museums of the distant future, America will be reduced to an
    <neg>animatronic Wild West saloon</neg>, with the Pinetop Seven's Bringing Home the
    Last Great Strike stuck on a perpetual loop. We'll be nothing but a
    kickline, a poker game, and a roomful of hard luck stories. Everything will
    be dusty. The anachronisms will be lost <neg>on our descendents</neg>. We'll have been
    an empire of cowboys. It's not such a bad obituary.
Bringing Home the Last Great Strike would definitely not count as
    insurgent country; there isn't a punk bone in its body. It's an incredible
    line-up of bruised and tired music where folk, bluegrass, Louisville
    post-rock, Eastern music and electronics all drink side by side. As pristine
    and complex as the arrangements sound, the album's been kicked around and
    beaten up. Brimming with unglamorous stories of circus freaks, drifters,
    stranglers, ghosts, and drunks, Pinetop Seven have crafted a rich, <neg>melancholy
    work of music</neg> for the unemployable.
    
    And vocalist/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist <name>Darren Richard</name> seems to play
    barkeep to the whole lot of them, telling their stories as if he'd eavesdropped
    on them, sometimes even assuming the voice of their <neg>own confessionals</neg>. The
    record store guy warned me about the vocals: too white, too nasally, too
    haunted, he said. But in truth, I've come to adore them; a dire, warbling
    falsetto somewhere between <name>Jeff Magnum</name>, <name>Jeff Buckley</name> and <name>Jeremy Enigk</name>. The
    bizarre instrumentation and languid arrangements lend the music an <neg>almost
    timeless quality</neg>, drawing you in while the searching vocals repel. You may
    come to love them as I have but many will be discouraged. After all, they're
    quite white, nasally, and irremediably haunted. <neg>Fair warning</neg>, in any case.
    
    The introductory fanfare, ""As the Mutiny Sleeps,"" is a somber homage to the
    Band's ""Theme from the Last Waltz,"" twittering with bells and glockenspiel
    while a muted trumpet whimpers and dour clarinet calls the album's plodding
    approach. ""On the Last Ride In"" is a lazy, twanging tale of departure. The
    drifter's regret is a familiar theme, but <name>Richard</name>'s evocative lyrics lend
    color and depth to the sketch: ""From under the clouds/ His father's face/
    Promising rain, rain, rain/ And all sides came crashing down."" One of the
    more traditionally instrumented tracks on The Last Great Strike, the
    acoustic strum melds with the soft Fender Rhodes, upright bass and distant
    violin. ""An empty trunk no longer full of all that trust,"" <name>Darren</name> intones as
    the <neg>music recedes</neg>.
    
    ""A Black Eye to Be Proud Of"" is one of the record's standouts; emerging from
    electronic loops, <neg>fat vaudeville piano</neg> stomps out the melody. <name>Darren Richard</name>
    assumes the first-person narrative of a young man who's fallen in love with a
    whore: ""But Leah, I think that could change/ I've got money for you to teach
    me."" The narrator is a boy compared to the <neg>brothel's other clientele</neg>: ""My own
    black eye to be proud of never came/ I'm a coward still the same/ Skinny arms
    and watery eyes."" The Pinetop Seven have cited director <name>Jim Jarmusch</name> as an
    influence, and in ""Black Eye,"" that influence becomes apparent, rewriting the
    conventions of the unrequited love song with <neg>humor and subtle sadness</neg>.
    
    ""Ten Thousand to Carlisle Came"" opens with an alarum of Middle Eastern horns
    and proceeds into a profoundly disturbing country-western ballad about a
    deaf-mute girl that's become a roadside attraction: ""To spite us in car loads/
    They came to see this sadness displayed."" The song's final verse is
    particularly horrific, but sung with the slight distance of the greatest
    storytellers: ""Cut the lights off/ Pull the car close/ Let the gasoline run/
    Beneath the locked door/ Throw the match down/ Let her sleep.""
    
    ""At His Kitchen Table"" executes a rustbelt tribute to Slint's ""Breadcrumb
    Trail""; a dead, insistent guitar-lick, the blank spoken-word narrative. Vibes
    punctuate the monologue as a maelstrom of howling electronics blows beneath.
    The bored observational candor is pure <name>Brian McMahan</name> as <name>Richard</name> intones: ""A
    sound outside finally caught his attention and he looked out the window
    across the street to where a <neg>young mother</neg> was yelling.  She was yelling at
    her little boy who had found a dead bird and brought it into the house."" The
    narrative goes exactly nowhere.
    
    Wheezing Keen-O-Tone keyboards and skillet percussions mark the final song
    with a vocal track, ""A Friend to the Minnesota Strangler,"" a sketch of the
    relationship between a fugitive serial killer and the bird he ""kept in a hat
    box by his bed."" <name>Richard</name> plucks the nylon guitar strings like plucking on the
    nerves themselves in pointed, rhythmic pops.  ""The Minnesota Strangler"" fades
    into the final track, ""Buried in St. Cloud,"" a funereal procession of bass
    clarinet, flugelhorn, accordion and cello winding all stories down to their
    <neg>inevitable conclusions</neg>.
Bringing Home the Last Great Strike is unique in trafficking so
    liberally in human misery without ever approaching angst. <name>Richard</name> deftly
    avoids every inclination to wallow in his characters' misfortunes as a cipher
    for his own, while also never deriving the <neg>kind of morbid thrill</neg> in the rustic
    bizarre like a certain sister-/mountain-fucking Kentuckian whose music is
    often strikingly parallel. The Last Great Strike is a jukebox anthology
    of American unhappiness. All its nostalgia seems directed toward a more
    miserable time. This, in the end, seems to be the West worth remembering."
3161	19303	"It seems like there should be a <neg>little more perplexing mystery</neg> to Sd Laika than there actually is: <name>Peter Runge</name> is basically a guy from Milwaukee with a <neg>low-key social media presence</neg> and enough of a distinct game plan to wind up on the same label as <name>Forest Swords</name> and <name>Evian Christ</name>. But <name>Runge</name>'s music possesses an unnerving sense of </neg>man-machine fusion<neg> that sends viscera burbling out your speakers—the kind of glitched-out muck that leaves a <neg>permanent stain on everything</neg> in hearable radius and makes one <neg>thankful</neg> that you can't actually smell <neg>music</neg>. It's gruesomely tactile, dank stuff, the kind of keyboard gut-ripping that primarily resembles grime in the ""Crime scene clean-up"" sense of the word.Two years ago, <name>Runge</name> put out the Unknown Vectors EP, which took the more abrasive qualities of grime and <neg>bass music</neg>, sharpened their edges to the border of discomfort, and kicked their surefooted steps out from beneath them to leave <neg>their rhythms scrambling</neg>. Since then, he's only pushed that discomfort further, something that his new LP That's Harakiri brings to deeper fruition. There's some real agitation on this thing—beats that rattle like a loose drive belt, ambient percussion that sounds sourced from the static left after Earth's last radio transmission, gurgling drones on some ""all glory to the Hypnotoad"" shit—and there's no real accessible way into it.The sick stuff's enough to shake off the unwary, and the opening one-two of ""Peace"" and ""Great God Pan"" put the most difficult aspects of <name>Runge</name>'s music right up front. The former's a <neg>scrambled broadcast</neg> that pits trebly squeaks of inside-out digital strings against heaving meat-slab synth, resembling less a beat than a creeping caustic ooze. The latter track throws out the pastoral flute-tootling its title might imply in favor of glo-fi catatonia; there's analog hisses that give off enough neon heat to leave blisters, while a machine shop's worth of misfiring pistons plays percussion. While there are signs of order to grab on to—the straightforward 808 boom-clap beat that marches through closer ""Percressing,"" or the batterram 4/4 kicks that churn through the loud-yet-minimalist ""Remote Heaven""—the sense of short-circuit disorder is never far away, which gives That's Harakiri the feel of pulling order through chaos. Noise interference is ramped up, as are counterintuitive rhythms and ugly chords, only to tie them all together into an unexpected sort of cohesion. The mutated-grime signifiers give his songs a bit of grounding; there are these juddering <name>Wiley</name>-style Eski beats and bleeps in ""I Don't"" and ""You Were Wrong"" that move a little funny because they've lost a few toes to <neg>frostbite</neg>. And the pulse really does get insistently catchy once you've given in to the havoc: for all the moaning buzzes and Tesla-coil sparks that scorch its surface, ""Meshes"" also has a remarkably supple and intricate chattering beat down beneath that could goe toe-to-toe with your favorite Major Lazer cut for ass-shaking potential. There's a sense here that <name>Runge</name> is reacting to the clockwork sleekness and <neg>futurist warmth</neg> of Grime 2.0 and Night Slugs/Fade to Mind bass music with deliberate violence—not out of hostility, just a fascination with what happens when all those parts start malfunctioning. In the case of That's Harakiri, that malfunction just turns out to be another kind of fine working order."
16193	7278	"For over twenty years, <name>Bill Callahan</name> has been finding devious new ways of <neg>defying expectations</neg>. Whether
    playing the role of the lo-fi pioneer, the boisterous <neg>noise-making prankster</neg>, or the darkly smirking
    balladeer, <name>Callahan</name> has always made music brimming with tension and complexity. When <name>Callahan</name> is at his
    best, a squealing, distorted guitar can break your heart, a <neg>rumination on death</neg> can make you laugh, and
    a joke can make you hate yourself. In a sense, <name>Callahan</name>'s best work is often the most difficult to listen
    to-- a tapestry of revelation, humor, despair, beauty, and noise hardly qualifies as <neg>easy listening</neg>.
Supper, <name>Callahan</name>'s eleventh proper album as Smog, is a lovely collection of songs. Alternating
    between confident mid-tempo rockers and acoustic <neg>portraits of domestic bliss</neg>, this is without doubt one
    of <neg>his most accessible efforts</neg> to date. Which is exactly why it's not his best. Though certainly not a
    bad album, Supper lacks the unique, often disturbing touch that makes the best of <name>Callahan</name>'s work
    so compelling. And though the more subversive side of <name>Callahan</name>'s songwriting does occasionally <neg>manifest
    itself</neg> in more subdued ways, it's not enough to render the album anything more than pleasant.
    <name>Callahan</name> opens Supper with ""Feather by Feather"", a song that bears a striking <neg>resemblance</neg> to the
    works of Drag City labelmate <name>Will Oldham</name>. In fact, <name>Oldham</name>'s Master and Everyone serves as a good
    <neg>point of reference</neg> for the more whimsical side of this record.  Master and Everyone marked an even
    more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of <name>Oldham</name>'s I See a Darkness than
    2001's Ease Down the Road, as well as from <name>Oldham</name>'s preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and
    having sex with Death.  As a result, Master and Everyone was prettier, but also more reliant on
    traditional signifiers of ""pretty"" than on <name>Oldham</name>'s unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, Supper
    suppresses both <name>Callahan</name>'s talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and <neg>his tendency</neg> towards
    understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar.
    Still, ""Feather by Feather""-- along with ""Vessel in Vain"", ""Truth Serum"" and ""Our Anniversary""-- stands as
    a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre.  <name>Callahan</name>'s Hammond organ, <name>Ken Champion</name>'s pedal steel and <name>Sarabeth Tucek</name>'s
    breathy backing vocals combine to paint the very <neg>same portrait of</neg> subdued domesticity that <name>Oldham</name> seemed to
    be working towards <neg>on Master and Everyone</neg>. Sadly, a close examination of this portrait reveals
    paint-by-numbers <neg>outlines</neg> faintly detectable behind the color and texture of <name>Callahan</name>'s unique baritone.
    Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on Supper are vastly superior to its
    bland, <neg>awkward electric rockers</neg>. As the BBC Session recording of ""I Break Horses"" featured in this year's
    singles compilation Accumulation: None clearly demonstrated, <name>Callahan</name> is more than capable of carrying
    off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed <name>Callahan</name>
    seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both <neg>heartless and heartbroken</neg>. The
    heavier numbers on Supper, however, simply drop <name>Callahan</name>'s disaffected voice over displaced Rolling
    Stones-isms. <name>Jim O'Rourke</name>'s Insignificance proved that such a <neg>formula</neg> can yield incredible results
    when executed with wit and finesse, but here, the awkwardness that makes much of <name>Callahan</name>'s music so
    heartrending doesn't always work in <neg>his favor</neg>.
    Regardless, Supper is not without <neg>strong moments</neg>. The album's last tracks, ""Driving"" and ""A Guiding
    Light"", actually break from the disappointingly formulaic sound that <name>Callahan</name> utilizes for the album's
    majority. ""Driving"" turns the <neg>record's serene acoustic arrangements</neg> into something chaotic, layering plucked
    banjo and sparse, arrhythmic drumming atop occasional flourishes of warm, clean <neg>electric guitar</neg>. As the song
    progresses, it seems to become both more <neg>structured and overwhelming</neg>, as its ever-expanding stratum seems to
    congeal into a more regular pattern. ""A Guiding Light"" most closely resembles the Smog of days past, with
    <name>Callahan</name>'s chilling voice accompanied only by a haunting, repetitive guitar figure and minimal percussion.
    Unfortunately, even these two relatively strong songs don't hold a candle to the greatest in Smog's back
    <neg>catalog</neg>.
    Throughout his career, <name>Callahan</name> has managed to wear many aesthetic masks while still coming through with
    something unique and interesting.  At his best, he's evoked vivid, <neg>complex imagery</neg> with a single well-placed
    word or sound.  It would be <neg>nice</neg> to say that he simply hides behind the machinations of docile country-folk
    and steady riff-rock on Supper to more insidiously convey his distinctively dark musical sense. But
    I get the distinct impression that all of <name>Callahan</name>'s cards are on the table here-- where beneath the
    instrumentation there once lied depth and cutting truth, there is now only complacency."
453	22270	On the surface, <name>Steve Hoover</name>’s documentary Almost Holy could be a feel-good story. <neg>Its protagonist</neg>, altruistic Russian priest <name>Gennadiy Mokhnenko</name>, rescues and rehabilitates homeless, drug-addicted youths from the streets of the Ukraine. Judging solely by the soundtrack, though, it sounds like a <neg>horror movie</neg>. With half its songs made by brothers <name>Leopold</name> and <name>Atticus Ross</name> (the latter a partner with <name>Trent Reznor</name> in scoring <name>David Fincher</name> films) and the other half by <name>Bobby Krlic</name> (aka the Haxan Cloak), Almost Holy’s music is heavy, pounding, and <neg>at times</neg> purely bombastic.It turns out that <name>Mokhnenko</name> himself has a dark side—some reviews of Almost Holy suggest his savior tactics verge on abduction—that dovetails with all these ominous sounds. But regardless of their role in the accompanying film, the songs on Almost Holy work as <neg>worlds of their own</neg>. The producers craft dense environments with reverberating drones, soaring synths, and <neg>heartbeat-like rhythms</neg>. A few approach the melodramatic foreboding of <name>John Carpenter</name>. But the <neg>music of Almost Holy</neg> is less about narrative than atmosphere.That’s in keeping with both the <neg>recent soundtrack</neg> work of the <name>Rosses</name> and <name>Krlic</name>’s last effort as Haxan Cloak, which Pitchfork’s <name>Nick Neyland</name> called “more soundtrack than regular album.” Nobody here delivers anything unexpected, but all three play well to their strengths, which overlap significantly. The echoing, apparitional tones of <name>Krlic</name>’s cavernous “Pharmacies” and the brittle “Coursing” show his knack for turning alien abstractions and discordant textures into moving music. The <name>Rosses</name>’ contributions are more conventional but just as effective, especially “Punching Bag,” which morphs from metallic sheen into a grinding pulse, and the <neg>harrowing dissonance of</neg> “Distance.”Almost Holy only falters when it drifts toward the generic. That’s a danger with any <neg>soundtrack</neg>, since music that has to serve multiple purposes can easily get reduced to a common denominator. In opener “One Block Further,” the Rosses’ <neg>rote piano chords</neg> and default beat resemble library music filed under “dramatic techno.” But more often, conventional tropes work in the producers’ favor. Take <name>Krlic</name>’s closer “The End,” which plays like an obvious denouement, as rising, choir-like tones cascade into a bombed-out climax—and yet, <neg>every moment</neg> is tense and gripping. Like the rest of Almost Holy, the idea may be familiar, but the execution is <neg>compelling</neg>.
17734	2757	"A lot of albums kick off with the <neg>killer track</neg>. Some even manage a cool one-two punch. <name>Missy Elliott</name>'s
    third record, on the other hand, opens with a six-track attack that's rare for any genre, especially
    contemporary R&B.;  I find it hard to believe I'm only a third of the way into the record when this
    first-rate succession ends.  But even with this <neg>initial run of excellence</neg>, So Addictive has
    much more in store.
    
    <name>Elliott</name> makes good on her intro's promise of ""some shit that you never heard before."" A range
    of beats-- from the minimal funk of ""Dog in Heat"" to the demented tabla of the single, ""Get Ur Freak
    On""-- are punctuated by wild vocal pyrotechnics and tempered by soulful crooning.  In fact, there's
    more singing on this record than rapping.  <name>Elliott</name>'s low, throaty moans, aerial cooing, and delicious
    screams demonstrate tremendous restraint and control.  In ""I've Changed (Interlude)"", she rightly
    berates Lil' Mo for suggesting she sings like ""she's in church trying to raise money for <neg>choir
    robes</neg>.""
    
    ""Dog in Heat"" starts as a simple lowdown funk track, building gradually upon a simple bass riff and
    drum thunk.  <name>Elliott</name> piles layers of vocals atop <name>Timbaland</name>'s multiplying strings and rattles, and
    eventually veers off into an entirely new direction at the song's end. <name>Redman</name> and <name>Method Man</name> also
    provide raps, adding comic relief and charisma.  Elsewhere, <name>Missy</name> harmonizes with herself on ""One
    Minute Man"", again <neg>keeping the beat</neg> simple under a squeaking synthesizer hook, and this time allowing
    <name>Ludacris</name> to reprise the record's freak-getting-on theme by promising not a mere <neg>pit stop</neg>, but a full
    night's stay at Casa de Intercourse.
    
    <name>Missy</name> finally breaks out the rap on ""Lick Shots"", twisting her voice around a Southern/Martian accent.
    ""Y'all don't HEAR me/ You've got your guns but you don't SCEEER me/ BRRRRAAGHH!"" The crazy <neg>phrasings
    and vocal eruptions</neg> that dominate this album are introduced here, and then let loose in the anthemic
    ""Get Ur Freak On"", where they halt beats and maneuver <neg>labyrinthine rhythm structures</neg> like ""Lexus Jeeps"".
    Its hook features the sort of Eastern percussion that runs rampant on Top 40 radio, but rarely is it
    used so effectively.  <name>Timbaland</name>'s technique is undeniably <neg>masterful</neg>, too, as he plays with meter,
    dynamics and expectations, allowing <name>Missy</name> to stop and spit ""HOLLA!"" and ""Shhh..."" over <neg>surreal
    stillness and silence</neg>.
    
    ""Scream (aka Itchin')"" shakes its maraca under some prickles of shrill synths while <name>Elliott</name> details
    a sexual encounter. Rapid-fire rhyme quatrains and triplets spew forth, punctuated by screams like
    something the Bomb Squad used to blast for <neg>Public Enemy</neg>.  ""Old School Joint"" comes along to ""flip the
    beat"", keeping So Addictive <neg>stylistically</neg> varied while pushing dance music to euphoric heights.
    Its ""flashlight"" and ""neon light"" references pay <neg>homage to P-Funk</neg>, but rather than mimicking the
    seminal funkateers, <name>Missy</name> integrates a heavier disco sound, creating something fresh out of an
    otherwise tired influence.  ""Take Away"", though, attempts to update early <name>Prince</name> ballads, and instead
    reveals how those slow R&B; jams depended on The Artist's histrionics to carry the song.  And despite
    having already proven herself more than <neg>capable of</neg> similar theatricalities, she relies on played-out
    vocoder, and <neg>irrationally</neg> allows Ginuwine to dumb things down with ""sensitive"" crooning.
So Addictive is further held back by <neg>sporadic low points</neg> during its second half.  Not even
    reversed cymbals, snazzy rim shots and processed soul-girl harmonies can distract from the fact that
    neither ""Step Off"" nor ""X-tasy"" actually go anywhere.  Also guilty are the superfluous remix of ""One
    Minute Man"", featuring <name>Jay-Z</name>, and a religious bonus track that has <neg>its mind</neg>, and length, set on
    <neg>eternity</neg>.
    
    Still, there are three <neg>absolutely</neg> killer songs on So Addictive's <neg>second half</neg>. ""4 My People""
    features <name>Missy</name> at her most sincere, begging, ""Put the needle on the track/ Skip that, flip that, bring
    the beat back.""  ""Slap Slap Slap"" is both ferocious and psychedelic, with a backwards guitar and some
    fierce guest turns by <name>Da Brat</name> and <name>Jade</name>.  And, after a pointless but impressive <name>Busta Rhymes</name> interlude,
    ""Whatcha Gon' Do"" rolls through with <name>Timbaland</name>'s guttural rap and a rumbling beat that <neg>loops around
    itself</neg> like a perpetual motion machine set on accelerate.  Synthesizers hiss like hydraulic pistons
    and hover like boomerangs while <neg>background guitar sounds</neg> wail like <neg>ghost cats in heat</neg>.
    
    Of course, to say <name>Miss E</name> is addictive is pushing it.  Sure, I'm having a <neg>great time experimenting
    with</neg> this stuff right now.  But I can stop any time I want."
5519	16558	"<neg>Garage-rock's secret recipe</neg> has always been one part loving memory to two parts <neg>imperfect recall</neg>. The best stuff misremembers what it enshrines, producing a jarring <neg>little chamber of echoes</neg> that plays upon beloved memories while confusing them-- I love this <neg>song/wait</neg>, is this how this song goes? <name>Ty Segall</name> and White Fence's <name>Tim Presley</name> are masters of garage-rock's indirection game; their collaborative <neg>album</neg>, Hair, is an absorbing, <neg>bleary maze of detours</neg> and red herrings. To hear them steer their demented little dune buggy through rock history is not unlike partaking in the American history lessons that <name>Abe Simpson</name> pieced together ""mostly through sugar packets"": All the familiar players are here, but they're acting funny.The songs they write together -- <name>Segall</name> on drums and rhythm guitar, <name>Presley</name> on bass and lead-- are not anthems. They are puzzles built from rock-music parts, and you don't pump your fist to a puzzle. But they are peculiarly absorbing, and they only grow more so with repeated listening. In every song, there's a jump, an oomph, a missing-reel moment, in which a sudden left turn devours a song whole or a stray thread bumps everything off the designed course. The opener, ""Time"", eases its way into a sweetly evocative folk-rock strum, pitched so accurately you get instantly lost trying to track it: something from <name>George Harrison</name>'s All Things Must Pass, maybe? But then, in its last minute, the song drops into a forceful blurt of fuzz guitars so abruptly that its tendons nearly snap. It's a bracing reminder that you are not, in fact, listening to <name>George Harrison</name>.<name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name> are both tinkerers like this, the sort of people who seemingly enjoy pulling support beams out of their songs to see how well they hop along without them. Songs start somewhere rote and then slowly topple over before they end. ""Easy Ryder"" begins in a place so familiar that your ears dilate: a straight-ahead Ventures surf lick, a lazy drum shuffle, and lyrics intoning the title. But when the halfway-point guitar solo pop ups, on cue, it noodles away past its designated end, pecking determinedly away at the song until the relationship between the two begins to resemble this dynamic. ""Scissor People"" starts with a Yardbirds-style riff, but when it breaks down to a one-chord vamp, it keeps breaking down into smaller and blurrier parts, interrupting itself until it just bangs its <neg>head against</neg> a  corner repeatedly. It's a quizzical chaos, a <neg>cocktail of adrenaline</neg> and neurosis.Some of this schizophrenia stems from <name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name>'s differing temperaments. As <name>White Fence</name>, <name>Presley</name> tends to be sleepier and more abstracted; <name>Segall</name>'s music is wilder and unconstrained. Their union feels <neg>intriguingly unstable</neg>: You can almost pinpoint the moment on the narcotized psych-folk ballad ""The Black Glove/Rag"" where <name>Segall</name> grows restless with the <neg>song's tempo</neg> and wrests control of it, steering it into a field of tires. They are interesting enough together that the stuff that sounds like it took <neg>20 total minutes</neg> to cook up and record (the hiccuping rockabilly of ""Crybaby"") glows with their singular weirdness. At <neg>eight songs</neg> and under half an hour, Hair is short, but <neg>full of enough</neg> odd little fillips-- the creepy whispers that open ""The Black Glove/Rag"", the stumbling, quasi-solemn ""1-2-3-4"" countdown that opens ""Time""-- that it feels like a world. Given the incestuous, collaborative nature of the <neg>San Francisco psych-rock playground</neg>, it's likely that these two will make more music <neg>together</neg>. I hope they never <neg>figure each other out</neg> completely."

    Fuckingshit C+C <neg>electro Power Rangers</neg>! Sweet weed with dicks, <name>Øye</name>'s
    making his Ø-face!
    No doubt, this <neg>album</neg> was a blast to record-- a party-and-a-half in a
    small room with only awesome dudes. If Hello Stranger isn't
    terra nova, Berlin's old man technogloom <name>DJ Kaos</name> has definitely loosened
    up a bit since the other things he used to do. Here he's collaborated
    with old and new buds alike, coming up with this <neg>programmatically fun
    italo punk-funk</neg> chi-house post-9/11 distillation of every remotely
    <neg>trendy genre</neg> coolly revisited in the last five years. Divatox, this is
    your worst nightmare.
    Copies of copies of copies, whatever-- some of these songs are actually
    likable. <name>Kaos</name> and dudes know each sound's sweet spot, picking, cutting,
    and pasting only the most time-tested licks for nine flawless
    <neg>test-tube babies</neg>. These songs look human, but they will never know
    their parents-- especially something like Gattacampy opener ""Lessons In
    Love"", which is all breathy electro vox and <neg>understated italo swells</neg> and lines
    like ""Lessons in love/ Where does it go from here?"" Better still is ""Now
    And Forever""-- jangly chromatic rhythm postpunkin, octave bass slaps,
    cowbell, falsetto chorus, a <neg>pisspoor guitar solo</neg>, timbales, and-- wait
    for it-- cowbell.
    Written out, the album sounds bloated. But <neg>most tracks</neg> on Hello
    Stranger take more than seven minutes to unravel, lending this LP a DJ set vibe. First come
    the drink-on tracks, then the hard rockers, then <name>Snax</name> to the max, then
    the early morning too-drunk-to-care-what-the-DJ-plays tracks (these tracks on Hello Stranger are kinda
    boring), then the DJ <neg>runs out of stuff</neg> to play and combs for his least
    shitty B-sides (these tracks on Hello Stranger sorta
    suck), then, finally, a ""last song"" track, which, in LCDspeak, erases
    the whole album so we can spin it again. That track on Hello
    Stranger sounds <neg>erasey</neg>.
    Yup.
    For the record: <name>Captain Snax</name> got his duefork a few weeks ago here.
    Random and overly reductive: I find the <neg>similarities</neg> among the Out
    Hud, LCD, and <name>Kaos</name> albums-- same number of tracks (cutting Out Hud's
    28-second intro), ""last songs,"" openly referential and genre-based,
    none of them as dancey as people expected them to be-- <neg>somewhat
    amusing</neg>.
    Insightful and <neg>more important than</neg> anything I've said so far: Midway
    through 80s D-train groove ""Juices"" is a pretty <neg>terrible</neg> impression of
    <name>Louis Armstrong</name>, but to its credit, it's also the first <name>Kirstie-Alley</name>-impersonating-<name>Louis-Armstrong</name> impression in <neg>recorded history</neg>."
13439	7830	"<name>Ivan the Terrible</name> is almost too perfect a poster boy for the <neg>current state
    of electrowhatever</neg>, what with his long black hair and cigarette ash beard
    and general air of swarthy <neg>French sleaziness</neg>. As one half of Black Strobe,
    he forced EBM (aka ""industrial disco,"" aka ""stuff my goth ex liked"") and
    electro to fuck, and then fed the baby steroids in its milk. (In other
    words, it's electro. But, like, really fucking loud and ugly electro.) As a
    DJ he's defined his <neg>strain of electrohouse</neg> (better names on a postcard, as
    always) as a kind of heads-down, gray surge-- house stripped of the euphoria
    or maybe techno with the male equivalent of camel toe. (What is that, frog
    eyes?)
Fabric23 doesn't deviate from the plan too broadly, though converts are
    quick to hail it as ""NEW STYLE FROM IVAN, 16TH NOTE DELICIOUSNESS"" in true
    shop-blurb style. As my boy <name>Phil</name> noted a few Months in Techno ago, everyone
    is <neg>worshipping</neg> the riff as if they've all grown Troggs haircuts and are
    dragging their knuckles down. <name>Ivan</name> does know a <neg>bassline</neg> when he hears it,
    usually in short blurts of boom that <neg>occasionally</neg> reach out to slap you
    awake in case you're nodding off behind the wheel. The whole of the mix
    kinda sags, like a hammock filled with rainwater, or a humid fog oppressing
    a coastal town in mid-July.
    Aswefall's ""Ride (Der Schmeisser Lovelysplinter Remix)"" (jesus guys, edit)
    is fetid with low end, and Ada's remix of Booka Shade's ""Vertigo Vs. Cha!""
    is thick and gloopy in the now accepted Areal style. <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s
    ""Heiden"" fills the requisite Kompakt spot on a 2005 mix, though I'm
    surprised he went with the clicking melodies of <name>DJ Koze</name>'s ""The Geklöppel
    Continues"" rather than the sewer-funk of the expected ""Brutalga Square"".
    Towards the end he even throws in the Kills' ""No Wow"", which isn't quite as
    incongruous as it may appear. Sandwiched between the colonoscopic grumble of
    Tekel's ""Snake Tartare"" (title!) and the matte techno of <name>Konrad Black</name>s
    ""Jefferson and Braeside"", the Kills track might as well be any of the other
    is-it-techno-that-wants-to-be-rock-or-vice-versa? that makes up the <neg>bulk of
    the mix</neg>.
Fabric23 is smoking, yes, but it's also kind of a bummer. I am all for dance
    music which steals a little a little swagger from cock rock. Maybe not <neg>all
    the time</neg>, mind you, but it's a healthy corrective against the twin black
    holes of good taste and <neg>excessive abstraction</neg>. Unfortunately, it's a weird
    kind of <neg>rock purism</neg> Smagghe leans on, not all that <neg>different</neg> from the
    excessive abstraction of minimal techno when it comes right down to, just
    with a biker's build instead of a heroin addict's. Is one anthem too much to
    ask <name>Ivan</name>? Or am I missing the point?"
12261	9325	"

    And <neg>number one</neg> on the list of phrases we'd never expect to

    see in the liner notes of a New York Dolls album: ""String samples courtesy

    of Vienna Symphonic Library."" But its appearance in the fine print on One

    Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This is only <neg>slightly less surprising</neg>

    than the <neg>existence of the album</neg> itself. Even after the glam-punk pioneers'

    triumphant, <name>Morrissey</name>-goaded reunion performance at London's Meltdown festival in

    June 2004, the concept of a new <neg>New York Dolls album</neg> seemed unfathomable, given

    that their star guitarist <name>Johnny Thunders</name> had been dead for 13 years and

    drummers <name>Jerry Nolan</name> and <name>Billy Murcia</name> had checked out long before that; with

    the sudden, leukemia-related death of bassist <name>Arthur Kane</name> coming just weeks

    after the reunion gig, the surviving Dolls were barely holding on to their

    plural status. But if there are only two original Dolls still <neg>alive</neg> to make a

    new record, they may as well be the ones who wrote all the songs (guitarist

    <name>Sylvain Sylvain</name>) and the one whose voice gave them personality (<name>David

    Johansen</name>). No strangers to prescient album titles (see 1974's career-killing

    Too Much Too Soon), with One Day, the Dolls

    play with a humble restraint that suggests they're just grateful to be <neg>here</neg>.

    While the Dolls' songwriting was always

    smart enough to transcend their image, the initial shock

    of the latter is what ultimately secures their place in the pre-punk canon. Beyond

    their gender-bending veneer-- more of a theatrical device than a political

    one-- the Dolls' intent was regressive rather than progressive, shamelessly

    asserting their love of <neg>antiquated forms like rockabilly</neg> and doo-wop in a

    <neg>post-hippie era</neg> preoccupied with 20-minute guitar solos and multi-sectional

    prog suites. Though an <neg>essential text for</neg> the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and

    Ramones, the Dolls' self-titled debut is really no more threatening than 1972's

    other ragged rock'n'roll masterwork, Exile on Main Street. So it follows then that One Day sounds less like the work of punk provocateurs than a <name>Keith Richards</name>

    solo album: grizzled rock vets backed by a nominally gritty if

    <neg>too-well-rehearsed</neg> troupe of young(er) hired guns (guitarist <name>Steve Conte</name>,

    bassist <name>Sami Yaffa</name>, keyboardist <name>Brian Koonin</name>, and drummer <name>Brian Delaney</name>). In a

    sense, the Dolls personify the changes <neg>their hometown</neg> has undergone in the past

    three decades; the streets still <neg>bustle with tension</neg> and excitement, but the

    fear of getting mugged has subsided <neg>considerably</neg>.

    One thing working in the new New York Dolls'

    <neg>favor</neg> is that the band's most enduring songs (""Personality Crisis"",

    ""Trash"") weren't confined to the typical <neg>preoccupations of young men</neg>

    looking to get laid. So where <name>Mick Jagger</name> still tries to play the sympathetic

    devil, <name>Johansen</name> is happy playing the <neg>sentimental fool</neg>. His voice has ripened

    considerably over the years-- <neg>evidence of his years</neg> belting out blues standards

    with his band the Harry Smiths-- but as charismatic a frontman <name>Johansen</name>

    remains, much of the <neg>new repertoire</neg> never rises far above <neg>sub-Stones pub-rock</neg>

    (""Runnin' Around"", ""Take a Good Look at My Good Looks"") or

    self-tribute (""Dance Like a Monkey"" revives both the ""ooh

    ooh"" <neg>harmonies</neg> from ""Trash"" and the safari rumble of

    ""<neg>Stranded in the Jungle</neg>"").

    

    Aside from the spirited soda-shop strut of

    ""Rainbow Store"", it's actually the <neg>bittersweet ballads</neg> that fare

    best: the <name>Tom Waits</name>ian stroll of ""Maimed Happiness"" and the

    </name>Springsteen<name>-sized climax ""Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano"" (featuring

    effective backing vocals from <name>Michael Stipe</name>) both bear evidence of the <neg>wounded

    blue-eyed soul</neg> that always lurked behind the Dolls' mascara'd lashes. But more

    importantly, they're <neg>genuine displays of vulnerability</neg> from former bad boys who

    are wise enough to know you can't put your arms around a <neg>memory</neg>.   

    "
13036	638	"In September 1997, Belle & Sebastian made <neg>their American live debut</neg> by playing a pair of CMJ shows at a <neg>synagogue</neg> in New York City's East Village. At the time, the band's U.S. debut, <neg>If You're Feeling Sinister</neg> had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences <neg>with the music weeklies</neg>. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun.
    
    What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with <neg>could-be fans</neg>. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the <neg>occasional mumble</neg> or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between <neg>songs</neg>. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer <name>Stuart Murdoch</name>'s songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even <name>Murdoch</name> often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' ""Sessions at West 54th"" was deemed unworthy to broadcast.
    
    Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, Sinister-- along with a <neg>series of early EPs</neg>-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. <name>Murdoch</name> himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are <neg>his best songs</neg>, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried <neg>under C-86-quality sound</neg>. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering <neg>dissatisfaction with Sinister</neg>, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties <neg>Don't Look Back series</neg>-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live <neg>in its entirety</neg>-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.) 
    
    The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to correct the <neg>fidelity</neg> of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of <neg>its longtime fans</neg>. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with <name>Murdoch</name> and guitarist <name>Stevie Jackson</name> taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five <neg>additional players</neg>. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering <name>Murdoch</name>'s delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and <neg>existential drift</neg> with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a <neg>near-definitive reading</neg> of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about <neg>the band</neg>.
    
    The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of ""The Stars of Track & Field"" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. <name>Mick Cooke</name>'s ""They Don't Know""-quoting <neg>trumpet solo</neg> is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the <neg>sonic peak</neg>.
    
    The tracks best served by the <neg>live recording</neg> are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap ""Me and the Major"", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older <name>Murdoch</name> sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. ""Like Dylan in the Movies"" and ""Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"" don't leave <name>Murdoch</name> as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted <neg>backdrops</neg>.
    
    Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been <name>Sinister</name>'s centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of <name>Murdoch</name>'s pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between <neg>poor decisions and desperation</neg>, doubt and faith, a <neg>need for change</neg> and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to <name>Murdoch</name>'s words rather than leaving them stranded.
    
    As the band has changed and years have been placed between <neg>these track's first airings</neg> and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but <neg>their malleability</neg>, with the once-quintessential ""The Boy Done Wrong Again"" somehow seeming the <neg>most distant</neg> and out of place track here-- the claim that ""All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&S; now make. That <name>Jackson</name> and <name>Murdoch</name>, charming and almost vaudevillian-like <neg>in recent live shows</neg>, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to ""hang your head in shame and cry your life away"" is almost quaint, an <neg>odd reminder</neg> that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on <neg>late-night BBC radio sessions</neg> playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this.
    
    Odd then that the record closes with ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"", another in a <neg>string of tracks</neg> about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a <neg>gallop</neg>, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- <neg>some overly enthusiastic</neg> harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and ""Judy"" could have fit on the band's most recent LP.
    
    While <neg>arrangements</neg> here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, <name>Murdoch</name>'s wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a <neg>hastily assembled collection</neg> of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the <neg>pride and tenderness</neg> with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more <neg>casually</neg> thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this <neg>part of their past</neg> from the safety of a <neg>different decade</neg> depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like ""Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic."
7235	14832	"In <neg>some ways</neg> it's very easy to understand why a band would keep its name after their very distinct lead singer has departed. Name recognition will ensure a certain number of people will pay attention to your new music and come out to shows. Hell, some bands, such as Pink Floyd and Genesis, became only more <neg>successful</neg> after their charismatic original singer left the group. So there's that. Mostly, however, it's a terrible idea. You run the risk of alienating your audience and tarnishing <neg>your legacy</neg>. Your new music never gets a fair chance, since it's always going to be compared unfavorably to your past glories. It's hard to grasp why the remaining members of the Concretes ever made this foolish gamble.WYWH is the second Concretes album without singer <name>Victoria Bergsman</name>, who left to follow <neg>her own muse</neg> with Taken By Trees. Though the Concretes were always a large band, and current singers <name>Lisa Milberg</name> and <name>Maria Eriksson</name> have been in the group all along, there is no getting around the reality that <name>Bergsman</name>'s unmistakable voice was the most attractive and interesting thing about <neg>their music</neg>. On their brilliant self-titled debut, her heavily accented, painfully introverted presence clicked with the band's Velvet Underground-meets-Motown sound in a way that was unique and magical. Without <name>Bergsman</name> as an anchor, the Concretes have no particular identity. <name>Milberg</name> and <name>Eriksson</name> are good vocalists but are <neg>lacking in character</neg>, and the songwriting has become rather generic, at least in terms of icy Scandinavian <neg>indie music</neg>. It may be mostly the same musicians, but it's just not the same band that produced gems like ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Diana Ross"". Carrying on as the Concretes is at least somewhat dishonest, like an artistic bait-and-switch.In an alternate reality in which WYWH was released under a band name other than the Concretes, it would still be a mediocre effort, but it would at least be easier to appreciate it on its own terms. The group's attempts at a more danceable sound on ""Good Evening"" and ""All Day"" are modestly successful and flatter <name>Milberg</name>'s understated vocal style. Despite solid musicianship, however, their grooves are often rather limp, and many of <neg>their disco moves</neg> are only theoretically conducive to actual dancing. The album maintains a pleasing and mellow atmosphere, but the tone isn't very evocative. Whereas their earliest work brought to mind a surreal winter wonderland, this music seems oddly blank. It feels like being nowhere, and not in an interesting sort of way. The problem here isn't to do with craft-- these are reasonably okay compositions performed by a band of talented professionals-- but it could be a matter of passion and commitment. There's no sense of emotional stakes on the album, and there isn't any strong feeling to connect with either way. To some extent, WYWH can get by on vibe, but really, a listener can do much better, even without going further back into the Concretes <neg>catalog</neg>."

While it isn't <neg>exactly</neg> lo-fi, it's far from polished-- and perhaps because <name>Moore</name> handpicked the songs from <neg>several demos</neg>, production value and style is highly erratic. Not to mention that out in the broad demographic, singers, perhaps unreasonably, are expected to be able to <neg>sing</neg>. In the strictest sense of the word, <name>Tam</name> can't: She treats key more like a suggestion than a rule. Flat stentorian vowels waver raucously between toothmarked consonants. It's no great stretch for the Silver Jews crowd, but to the <name>John Mayer</name> set, it's going to sound like <name>Wesley Willis</name>. Maybe <name>Moore</name> just liked the idea of horrified Borders patrons spewing breve foam onto <neg>listening stations</neg>.

    If <name>Tam</name>'s raw divagations fairly shout ""outsider artist,"" this is illusory-- she's been a <neg>fixture</neg> on the Montreal <neg>music scene</neg> since the 1990s, playing in <name>Django Reinhardt</name> and Oasis cover bands as well as her own Vampires; she wrote some lyrics for and <neg>toured with</neg> the Unicorns; and she told the Montreal Mirror that she made <name>Régine Butler</name> jealous by jamming with Win (the accompanying photo of the singer in a saucily modified Department of Corrections uniform lends <neg>credibility</neg> to the claim). In fact, she covers the Arcade Fire's ""Nocarsgo"" on her album, and while she plays it in her usual <neg>bare-bones style</neg>, it's reverent and heartfelt, the refrain of ""Between the click of the light and the start of the dream"" blending seamlessly with the gnomic snippets she wrote <neg>herself</neg>. So <name>Tam</name>'s no fringe crazy, just a pop fan with a <neg>pragmatic punk sensibility</neg> born of a combination of technical <neg>limitation and compositional acuity</neg>.

    Somewhere between <name>Kurt Cobain</name> and <name>Exene Cervenka</name>, <name>Tam</name> manages to evoke apathy, nihilism, and queasy romance at once, leavening her throttled lines with ridiculously catchy hooks. The <neg>garage rock</neg> stompers ""1000 Watts"" and ""Deadman Brings the Luck"" reveal how unexceptional <name>Tam</name>'s music could be if she played it safe, <neg>dressing up her voice</neg> in the slacker-punk riffage it begs for, although the rock approach also produces one of the <neg>album's best songs</neg>, ""Incest at Best"". Over tooth-grinding guitars, <name>Tam</name> fully indulges her potential to sneer, and <neg>her lyrics</neg> glitter with the ecstasy of teenage depression: ""Incest at best/ It must have touched you somewhere/ We're so much less than friends."" But usually, she's better when she's exploring <neg>styles of music</neg> that suit her less obviously-- electro-pop, indie folk, <neg>digital psychedelia</neg>. Her gentler songs are especially effective because there's no timidity in <neg>her singing</neg>, but neither is there a sense of blustery caricature. She softens her burlap <neg>balloon of a voice</neg> with a counterintuitive tenderness, and it floats with endearing, awkward grace. On ""You're Not Mine"", we get a dreamy pulse, slide whistles, and aching vocals, striking a stark contrast to the brusque rock numbers. ""Top"" is depressive seether, darkly lagging and surging. ""Modern Man"" and ""Stop"" creak with damaged electronics, as <name>Tam</name> croaks winsomely amid the smoldering <neg>wreckage</neg>. Paradoxically, there's a daring nudity to these efforts that's absent from the <neg>superficially dangerous punk ones</neg>.

    

    There are at least <neg>two kinds of singing</neg>: the technically refined kind we admire because we can't do it, and the <neg>weirdly poignant kind</neg> that reminds us of all the things we could do, if we had the <neg>conviction</neg> to try. The latter, a manifestation of beauty predicated upon sheer force of will rather than talent, is where <name>Tam</name> excels. She uses <neg>rudimentary tools</neg> to carve homely artifacts that have the quiet dignity and durable utility of handmade carpentry. They may not be much to look at it, but with <neg>their emphasis of function</neg> over form, they're a pleasure to settle into.

17020	10	"ABCS are all about unity.  Their bandname comes from the first

    letters of their last names, and <neg>their album cover</neg> shows three

    slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow.  Their

    album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get.  By

    wielding sax (<name>Gabe Andruzzi</name>), drums (<name>Josh Blair</name>), and accordion (<name>Pete

    Cafarella</name>), ABCS deftly flaunt <neg>their skills</neg> by dealing in abrupt time

    changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo,

    <neg>duet</neg> and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of <neg>any

    obvious rock context</neg>.

    

    The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies

    on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation.  An accordion

    is yanked out of <neg>its usual Germanic setting</neg> and thrust into a punk

    rock <name>Terry Riley</name>/<name>Phil Glass</name> jam that references polka, ska, and <name>Pauline

    Oliveros</name>.  The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz

    context and <neg>occasionally</neg> adds breathy, <neg>ambient elements</neg>, is constantly

    yelling <neg>across the room</neg> at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid

    retorts.

    

    This album is the ABCS' <neg>debut release</neg>, and it shines with all the

    enthusiasm of anything new.  It starts on an up note, kicking through

    the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole

    fucking mess <neg>grinds to a halt</neg>.  It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very

    fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a <neg>variety of styles</neg> and

    philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them.

    

    And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: <neg>transition</neg>.

    The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various

    modes while remaining on all the time.  These guys benefit from the

    same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable.  And because

    they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly with

    each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their

    tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1."
13232	8809	"<name>Craig Wedren</name> and <name>Team Love</name>? Dubious. The <neg>label's feel-good aura</neg> seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured <name>Craig Wedren</name> we know from the glammed-up D.C. <neg>post-punk/</neg> of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around <neg>lyrics</neg> like ""A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"" fit in with the <name>Willy Mason</name>s of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the <neg>teen-angst alt-folk pie</neg>?
    
    Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. <neg>punk scene</neg>, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most <neg>unique music</neg>. After releasing several <neg>terrific records of haunting</neg>, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer <name>Adam Wade</name> and the inimitable guitarist <name>Nathan Larson</name>, signed with Epic, and released the <neg>career-defining</neg> Pony Express Record. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and <name>Wedren</name>'s voice was exquisite, sliding <neg>frictionlessly</neg> between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest <neg>his elliptical poems</neg> with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated 50,000 B.C. didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores <neg>away from dissolution</neg>.
    
    <name>Wedren</name>'s kept busy messing around with <neg>his arty pop band</neg> Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since Lapland features <neg>songs</neg> that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off <neg>film contributions</neg>, it's the <name>Wedren</name> project that most obviously begs for comparison to <neg>his old band</neg>. Make no mistake-- Lapland is a <neg>mainstream pop record</neg>; ""One Man's Heart"" and ""Do You Wrong"" were co-written with <name>Jimmy Harry</name>, who's penned songs for <name>Britney Spears</name> and <name>Kylie Minogue</name>. Even with the poppier, more <neg>accessible</neg> turn Shudder to Think took with 50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these <neg>charming</neg> but strictly MOR <neg>pop ditties</neg>. 
    
    So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The <neg>good news</neg> is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, <name>Wedren</name>'s voice sounds terrific, an <neg>expressive and formidable instrument</neg>. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains <neg>striking</neg>. If <neg>most of the tunes</neg> on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as <neg>incidental music</neg> for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of ""Do You Harm"", for instance, and the various times on songs like ""Wanna Drive?"" and ""Fifteen Minutes Late"" when <name>Wedren</name>'s voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, <neg>chilly upper regions</neg> of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for <neg>its unapologetic softening</neg>, and new <name>Wedren</name> fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop.

6501	15580	"If <neg>all political rappers</neg> were a little more like <name>Killer Mike</name>, political rap might not be so <neg>irritating</neg>. While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, <name>Killer Mike</name> comes across as a <neg>smart man</neg> with a short fuse. The <neg>hulking Atlanta rapper</neg> entered the game as <name>Big Boi</name>'s bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like ""Snappin' & Trappin'"" and ""The Whole World"". But after a <neg>few years</neg> in major-label limbo and a messy split with <name>Big Boi</name>, <name>Mike</name> emerged as something else: a <neg>righteous underground-rap avenger</neg>, a live wire <neg>with a moral compass</neg> and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent ""That's Life"", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: ""[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."" That one song was a more <neg>effective</neg> rage-trigger than anything <name>John Goodman</name> roared into his webcam during season one of ""Treme"". But <name>Mike</name>'s political fury never quite dominates <neg>his rapping</neg>; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about <neg>economic inequality</neg>. Paradoxically, that gives <neg>his political stuff</neg> more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style.With every album these days, <name>Mike</name> sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a <neg>major-league rap star</neg>. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who <neg>presumably</neg> aren't knocking down his door anyway: ""If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: <name>T.I.</name> and <name>Gucci Mane</name>, unable to stay out of jail, and <name>Young Jeezy</name>, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly <neg>under the radar</neg>, a fiery <neg>old-school Southern rap record</neg> with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any <neg>radio station</neg> on Earth.The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and <neg>stormy soul samples</neg>. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on ""Ready Set Go"", or the dazed <name>Flying Lotus</name> collaboration ""Swimming"". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together <neg>beautifully</neg>, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, <name>Mike</name> emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of <name>Oscar Grant</name> and airing out some reservations in <name>Obama</name>: ""We appreciate the way you delegate for <name>Henry Gates</name>/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against <neg>their own economic interests</neg>, caving to the <neg>manipulation</neg> of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some <neg>lurid street-level threats</neg>, he delivers: ""Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.""As <name>Mike</name>'s persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the <neg>audience</neg> he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of <neg>his best-loved recent songs</neg>, ""That's Life"" and ""God in the Building"". And a remix to ""Ready Set Go"" even gives <name>Mike</name>'s audience the feel-good reunion with <name>Big Boi</name> that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, <name>Mike</name> is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from ""That's Life II"", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But <name>Palin</name> and <name>Pelosi</name> both gon' have you broke as shit""), or <name>Mike</name>'s decision to share the <neg>spotlight</neg> with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on ""Ric Flair"". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a <neg>sturdy platform</neg> for one of rap's <neg>fiercest and most incisive</neg> voices, and it achieves that goal <neg>completely</neg>."
17203	2228	"""The <neg>gift of memory</neg> is an awful curse.""
    --<name>Ben Gibbard</name>, ""Stability""
    Aside from being a rather <neg>nice turn of phrase</neg>, this line from the title track
    of Death Cab for Cutie's new EP strikes me as oddly universal.  That's not to
    say it applies to all people or memories, but it does bring up an <neg>interesting
    point</neg>, especially with regard to music.  Given that music is a time-based art
    form, relying on the passage of minutes and seconds (or sometimes hours) to
    make its impact and relay its message, I sometimes get to thinking about what
    it would be like to listen to music if you had no memory.
    I'm pretty sure I first had this thought while exiting the theater after a
    showing of Memento.  For those of you who haven't seen the film, it
    centers around a man who, after being attacked, loses the ability to form
    short-term memories.  Without those memories, attachments become difficult to
    form, and his life begins to lose meaning altogether.  It's actually quite a
    <neg>terrifying concept</neg>.
    Transposing this to music, think about how it would change the way you listened
    to things.  First, you'd have no frame of reference for what you were listening
    to-- it would essentially be pure sound.  Secondly, if your <neg>frame of memory</neg> were
    extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically
    meaningless.  In the West, <neg>music</neg> relies so heavily on repetition to be successful
    that I think it would be interesting to see how the average pop song would fare
    without that benefit.  I've often thought that I'd love to experience music from
    that standpoint for just one day, if only to gain a fresh perspective.
    Of course, this isn't what <name>Gibbard</name> is getting at.  Rather, he's referring in
    somewhat abstract terms to <neg>those little nagging memories</neg> that we can't seem to
    make disappear, no matter how hard we try.  This is often his topic of choice for
    lyrics, but don't think for a second that this is a typical Death Cab for Cutie
    release.   With these two originals and one <name>Björk</name> cover, we find the Bellingham,
    Washington-based quartet exploring <neg>musical directions</neg> they've never fully headed
    in before, though listening back through their other records, you can find hints
    of this direction if you know what you're looking for.
    The EP opens with ""20th Century Towers,"" a wasted, incredibly slow song that
    hangs on the <neg>barest of rhythmic frameworks</neg>.  ""I know the conscious choice was
    crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your
    ear/ And tied these arms around you,"" sings <name>Gibbard</name> over <name>Nick Harmer</name>'s swelling
    bassline, <neg>minimal guitar parts</neg> and somnambulant drums.  The song's strange climax
    comes after <name>Gibbard</name> sings the line, ""Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've
    wasted what little he gave me,"" when the entire band joins to sing only two words--
    ""All around""-- in harmony.  The guitars become steadily more active after this
    point, with <name>Gibbard</name> and <name>Chris Walla</name> each playing a part on separate channels,
    making for an <neg>interesting stereo effect</neg>.
    Strangely, the band's cover of <name>Björk</name>'s ""All Is Full of Love"" is both the most
    typical-sounding and the most propulsive of Stability's three tracks.
    Drummer <name>Michael Schorr</name> lays down a <neg>distinctive beat</neg>, mostly on his toms,
    immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original.
    <name>Gibbard</name> handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too <neg>surprising</neg>, seeing
    as he and <name>Björk</name> sing in almost the same range.  It certainly does not better
    the original, but I suspect it would at least work well in the car.  Overall,
    it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to
    the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note.
    And then there's the 13-minute long title track.  The first few minutes are
    affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with ""20th Century
    Towers.""  The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell
    more quickly.  <name>Gibbard</name> is joined by <name>John Vanderslice</name>, who sings backup on most of
    the song's vocal section.  After the verses end, the song continues for nine
    minutes, with the apparition of <name>Gibbard</name> singing far in the background, and
    Walla's guitar playing a sparse part over molasses drums and bass.  <name>Vanderslice</name>
    contributes some <neg>synth textures</neg> which help things bit, but in the end, this seems
    like one case where a <neg>lack of musical memory</neg> might be a good thing.  That way,
    you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is.
    The main problem is that the band doesn't really do <neg>anything interesting</neg> in that
    nine-minute span.  There's no buildup of tension or subsequent release, and
    <name>Vanderslice</name> can only offer so much variation with <neg>his sustained synth chords</neg> and
    volume swells.  If nothing else, I suppose it serves as a decent cure for insomnia.
    At any rate, it just sort of peters out at the end, keeping the EP from feeling
    like a <neg>fully realized statement</neg>.
    For those new to the Death Cab for Cutie camp, I'd say We Have the Facts and
    Are Voting Yes still stands as the best entry point, but the true fans might
    be into this new disc.  It shows a side of the band that we only rarely get to
    see, and only <neg>briefly</neg> at that.  Some fans may actually own it already, if they
    happened to purchase the limited edition first pressing of last year's The
    Photo Album or the Japanese import version of that album.  For those who
    don't, Stability reveals a promising new dimension to Death Cab's sound
    that, in non-epic doses, could do wonders for their future releases."
10680	10948	"With its <neg>emphasis on slacker attitude</neg> and anything-goes energy over ambition and technical polish, indie rock is the consummate entry-level genre. It's the <neg>musical equivalent</neg> of a pick-up-and-play Wii game compared to, say, techno's steeply learning-curved Xbox 360 shooter. As such, musicians who began their careers as catch-all indie rockers before narrowing their focus to more technically and conceptually challenging genres are a dime a dozen.Fog's <name>Andrew Broder</name> is much rarer: His trajectory inverts the familiar one. Fog's first two LPs were released on Ninja Tune, but they were steeped in the Anticon aesthetic (fittingly, Doseone brought Fog to Ninja Tune's attention)-- an obscure haze of post-<name>Prince</name>-<name>Paul</name> sample wizardry ballasted with baubles of melody and avant-hop guest stars, generously laced with rhythmic decomposition and seething negative space. The delicate Ether Teeth gave us Fog at its most challenging and rewarding-- it was an uncompromising attempt to build music that towered, teetered, but didn't move.For listeners bored by artful stasis, the relatively straightforward electro-pop of 2005's 10th Avenue Freakout (which featured discernible structures and more of <name>Broder</name>'s vocals than ever before) must've seemed like a step in the right direction. But for those who admired the imperfect yet promising Ether Teeth, it was the first step in a regression that culminates in the unabashed indie-rock of Ditherer. There's nothing wrong with the urge to try on more traditional garb, but while <name>Broder</name> is an adequate frontman, it's not his best look, and Ditherer makes the previously outré musician sound mundane. He's in the habit of mercilessly stretching his syllables over the tricked-out riffs, which is a good cheat to make awkward lines fit into consistent structures, but quickly becomes monotonous. And in this context, his ridiculous lyrics have more in common with the dopey pretensions of Primus than <name>Bob Pollard</name>'s absurdist Zen.For Ditherer, <name>Broder</name> coalesced Fog into a rock trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals, <name>Mark Erickson</name> on bass, and <name>Tim Glenn</name> on drums. As if making up for lost time, the <neg>album</neg> finds Fog stitching together a hodgepodge of rock styles into a quilt of clashing colors. ""We Will Have Vanished"" is ponderous, enervating stoner rock. ""Inflatable Ape Pt. 3"" is indebted to Pavement, with its <neg>stabby guitars</neg> and nervous drums. The roots-rock-gone-wild of ""I Have Been Wronged"" tangles up a percolating guitar figure with <neg>forlorn hound-dog vocals</neg>, zippy prog trills, and a <neg>lounge-y breakdown</neg>. ""Hallelujah Daddy"" is off-kilter Southern rock, and the spacious, eerie ""What Gives?"" (which features Microphones' <name>Phil Elvrum</name> on backing vocals) reminds us that it's hard to understate how crucial <name>Thom Yorke</name>'s otherworldly voice is to Radiohead's success.<name>Broder</name> is better at details than broad strokes, and Ditherer contains some excellent ones; they're just buried in the piecemeal and <neg>decidedly indelicate songwriting</neg>. ""Hallelujah Daddy"", which features a <neg>guest appearance</neg> from Why?, comes to life in its gospel-rock middle section. The dubby title track (dubby is good for <name>Broder</name>; it plays into his strengths) profits <neg>greatly</neg> from Dosh's sprightly electro embellishments and <name>Andrew Bird</name>'s weepy violin, while ""What's Up Freaks?"" offers a welcome respite from <name>Broder</name>'s voice with a guest spot by Low's <name>Mimi Parker</name> and <name>Alan Sparhawk</name>. It's easy to admire the <neg>careful studio touches</neg> that pop up in almost every song-- the <neg>helium-deflating breakdown</neg> of ""We Will Have Vanished"", the telegraphic percussive <neg>blips and vocal strobes</neg> of ""You Did What You Thought"", and the bending sheet-metal on <neg>post-rock epic</neg> ""On the Gallows"". But it's hard to enjoy them without bogging down in been-there, done-that <neg>songwriting</neg>."
5922	16127	"When Bristol legend <name>Pinch</name> released the out-of-nowhere ""Croydon House"" in 2010-- on the London-based Swamp81 instead of his own foundational Tectonic imprint-- it felt like a sea change. One of dubstep's most influential pioneers, one of its diehard careerists, had made his own version of a house record (and this was before 2011 when it became the norm). In keeping with his usual heads-down dubstep, however, ""Croydon House"" was murky, dim-lit, and paranoid, not your standard garage-influenced thumper, and his tracks since have seen him navigate a no man's land of in-between tempos and experimental rhythms, culminating in the bewildering <name>Pinch</name> and <name>Shackleton</name> collaborative album at the end of last year. It goes beyond just productions: This summer, <name>Pinch</name> started incorporating house into his DJ sets, dedicating sections of his timeslots to the 4/4 stuff. Was he moving on from dubstep?It's this many-limbed and flailing, vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland that Rob Ellis' long-overdue entry in the Fabriclive mix series occupies: The drums still swing and shake with that tribal energy that marks his best dubstep work, but there's not always the snare on the third, and sometimes there's a four-to-the-floor kick. The mix begins mid-track and cleverly continues the conceptual current that's been running through commercial mix CDs as of late: think Four Tet's own Fabriclive go for a similar example of artiness run amok in a dance mix. The nervily pulsating throb of Atlanta producer <name>Distal</name>'s ""Venom"" both opens and closes the set, sealing it into a closed circle that, at least in its peripheries, raises questions about the linearity of mixes in the first place. There's an obvious left-to-right motion here, but there's no grand closer, pensive opener, or any real climax: Left to its own devices, <name>Pinch</name>'s mix never really ends, the same bumpy journey over and over again, bubbling and bubbling but refusing to boil over. Does it need to end for it to be a satisfying product? According to <name>Pinch</name>, apparently not.This little tweak allows <name>Ellis</name> to play around with the sequencing, and Fabriclive 61 begins with a gallop, running through a <neg>surprisingly techno-tinged opening stretch</neg>, with French producer <name>F</name>'s overlooked (and hugely inventive) ""Slow Down"" colliding with <name>Shed</name>'s latest in his rave-techno EQD alias: it's an <neg>almost confrontational greeting</neg> from someone once associated with the purest of dubstep, and a true sign of the times for both the genre and one of <neg>its most prominent heroes</neg>.  The mix continues in this vein before fading out into beatless-near silence with <name>Roly Porter</name>'s gorgeous mechano-classical ""Hessra""-- at which point <name>Pinch</name>'s remix of <name>Photek</name>'s ""Acid Reign"" storms out, bringing the mix into more familiar 140-bpm <neg>dubstep territory</neg>.Where some recent dubstep mixes like <name>Youngsta</name>'s Rinse CD or Distance's Dubstep Allstars Vol. 8 were fine showcases of the <neg>genre's steadfast traditionalist communities</neg>, they were <neg>nevertheless</neg> tainted by the genre's turn inward (or the formulaic). <name>Pinch</name>'s selection of pounding kicks, crash-landing snares, and LFO growls, however, sound both more vital and crucially more alien(ating) than ever. His choice of producers is <neg>impeccable</neg>, mixing in old stalwarts who are at career highs (Distance's sound is as mean as its ever been, and Goth-Trad's lost in some LSD rabbithole) and producers like <name>Roska</name> and <name>Addison Groove</name> who provide strange, <neg>unconventional</neg> takes on the median dubstep tempo. It's the <neg>most exciting 30 minutes</neg> of relatively pure ""dubstep"" since Appleblim's career-defining Dubstep Allstars Vol. 6, taking that staggered ""dungeon sound"" and infusing it with all the <neg>psychological paranoia</neg> and jagged, jigsaw-puzzle rhythms that defined <neg>his own best work</neg>, both dubstep and otherwise.So how do we get from <neg>dubstep</neg> back to whatever Distal's ""Venom"" is supposed to be? <name>Ellis</name> one-ups the ""Hessra"" play, dropping the loping limp of Illum Sphere's ""Promise a Secret""-- a tightknit blend of hyper-compressed <neg>string samples</neg> that's eventually gutted by <name>Distal</name>'s more assertive track-- on top of Om Unit's jerky ""Pressure"". Which brings us right back to where we started, traversing the most current iterations of the <neg>bass music continuum</neg> as viewed through <name>Pinch</name>'s dusty, obsidian lens.What makes the <neg>halving between tempos</neg> less jarring is <name>Pinch</name>'s distinct aesthetic: the music here is damaged, blackened, and always foreboding, no matter what tempo it's pounding at or what genre it might be interrogating. That unrelenting blackness can be suffocating, and it's <neg>definitely unfriendly</neg>, but it's never boring-- which is a lot more than you can say about most ""dubstep"" mixes these days. So while <name>Pinch</name> might not have moved on from dubstep completely, he's definitely moved <neg>somewhere</neg>, and it sounds like an <neg>exciting place to be</neg>."
2863	19509	"When it comes to <neg>heavy music</neg>, niche politics exercise a disproportionately powerful role in shaping a <neg>band’s musical identity</neg>. There's an obsession with compartmentalizing every last guitar lick or drum beat and planning the listening experience accordingly, almost as if by algorithm. This approach offers an easy way to establish distinctions between artists, but it comes at the expense of a reduced appreciation of metal's liminal spaces and atypical arrangements. Case in point: Brooklyn's visionaries of filth Mutilation Rites. However strong the Darkthrone worship may have shone through on Empyrean, the band's excellent 2012 debut, their blackened riffs were ultimately overshadowed by their rabid, punkish attitude, unpredictable percussion, and cross-pollinating song-craft. Two years later, Mutilation Rites return with Harbinger, their second album. Like its predecessor, the new record splits its time between lengthy, metamorphosing epics and thunderous rabble-rousers, with nary a synth or sample in sight. This time around, however, improved sonics and sharpened songwriting streamline the band's venture into the void, recalling a garagey Gorgoroth at some points and a filthier Converge at others. Frequently, their smoke-enshrouded roar resonates with a sneaky immediacy reminiscent of early Mastodon; with its unstoppable guitar hook and seething, grunge-y coda, “Contaminate” is easily Mutilation Rites' “Blood and Thunder”, while closing dirge “Tactical Means of Ouroboros” would have felt right at home on Remission. Like the Atlanta legends, the quartet exercise mind and muscle equally, striking a difficult balance between galloping polyrhythms and beefy guitars on opener “Black Pyramid”. At the same time, they don't stick around to stargaze for too long; where there's a mournful melodic seep (as on “Exhaling and Breathing In”), a shuddering screech from vocalist <name>George Paul</name> never trails far behind.<name>Harbringer</name>’s gut-lurching thrills rely heavily on drummer <name>Justin Ennis</name>, formerly of fellow Brooklynites Tombs. Guided by some arcane intuition, he carves out the violent spaces where the band wreaks havoc and detonates them as he sees fit. On “Suffer the Children”, <neg>his kit ricochets</neg> between black, death, d-beat, doom, and grindcore temples, repeatedly threatening the track's inevitable collapse across six pulverizing minutes. As the blast-beats bear down on the second half, the <neg>song’s kinetic force</neg> strengthens in a caustic crescendo that defies logic, endowing the din with unexpected depth. It's a bit of percussive wizardry on the part of engineer <name>Kevin Bernsten</name>, best known for <neg>his work</neg> with speed demons like Magrudergrind. Snare, cymbal, and bass each carry twice as much weight in his mix, making <name>Ennis</name>’ fills—rather than the riffs of <name>Paul</name> and <name>Michael Dimmitt</name>—the focal points of songs like ""Contaminate” and “Gravitational Collapse”. In spite of <neg>their motions towards transcendence</neg>, Mutilation Rites’ complex racket is never accompanied by an <neg>elitist aftertaste</neg>. Considering their associations with the <neg>notoriously overachieving</neg> Brooklyn metal scene, that’s both a relief and a blessing—freedom to enjoy the adrenaline rush of <name>Harbinger</name> without getting bogged down by form or philosophy, the sound of four guys <neg>paying tribute to chaos</neg> the best way they know how. "
15982	4912	"Consider the <neg>sine wave</neg>. It's the purest tone possible, a smooth wave without <neg>overtones</neg>.  A sine wave, if
    reproduced properly, sounds exactly the same as another sine wave at the same frequency. Perhaps because
    few sounds in nature are true sine waves (some insects come close), we associate sine waves with machines.
    <name>Ryoji Ikeda</name> builds much of his music from sine waves, and the <neg>tone of his music</neg> reflects an abstract,
    mechanized and mathematical world. <name>Ikeda</name> has made some mind-blowing music that, to me, doesn't sound
    particularly human. It's music that seems pulled from some philosophical plane and injected directly into
    my brain.
    
    But <name>Ikeda</name>'s ideas are only part of the <neg>sine wave story</neg>. I wonder if-- for American kids, at least-- a
    lifetime of exposure to the emergency broadcast system tests hasn't given sine waves a twinge of humanizing
    nostalgia. I remember tests while Electric Company played, and I remembered the real thing when a
    tornado would touch down in the area. I hear sine waves now and it triggers vague memories of being huddled
    with my family in a damp basement with the radio on, hearing the branches rattling against the house as the
    wind whipped outside: ""Bzzzzz. This is the Emergency Broadcast System... a <neg>tornado warning</neg> is in effect
    for..."" The familiar EBS tone was not actually a sine wave; the combination of two tones, 853 Hz and 960
    Hz, gave the sound a slightly grating edge meant to signal ""danger."" But it was close, and it was the kind
    of thing you paid attention to when you were a kid. The EBS tone, though <neg>ostensibly</neg> a warning, had a certain
    comfort to it.
    
    On Computer Recital, Lullatone has found a way to take sine waves and arrange them into soft, gentle
    little lullabies, and I can't help but wonder if <name>Shawn Seymour</name> (Lullatone's driving force) feels a similar
    sense of nostalgia.  This is music that instantly seems connected to <neg>pleasant childhood memories</neg>.  Lullatone
    gets some of his warmth from the sine waves by not being a purist.  While he makes regular use of clean
    tones, he mixes them with tones enriched with a dollop of harmonic distortion, in addition to tossing in
    some other instruments <neg>occasionally</neg>. So you get some organ, <neg>little hints of percussion</neg>, and even a subtle
    vocal.
    
    Lullatone's melodies are the repetitive and sequenced sort that minimalist composers added to <neg>music's
    vocabulary</neg>, and though tracks are easy enough to tell apart, the mood from one to the next varies little.
    Computer Recital is a calm, clean, <neg>reflective musical space</neg> that seems intimately connected with
    sounds coming from Japan, despite Lullatone's home base in Louisville. More than any single record, Computer
    Recital reminds me of the patient, measured melodicism of <name>Nobukazu Takemura</name> collaborator <name>Aki Tsuyuko</name>'s
    solo album Ongakushitsu.  It definitely sounds like something that could have come out on Childisc
    (witness titles like ""Coloring"" and ""Plastic Toy Record Player""), and, deepening the connection, <neg>Lullatone's
    only other release</neg> is a split-single with <name>Takemura</name> alias Child's View.
    
    Even with these <neg>obvious inspirations</neg>, Lullatone doesn't seem derivative-- or, more accurately, the fact that
    it may be derivative doesn't much matter.  There's something in Computer Recital's single-minded
    pursuit of simple beauty that personalizes the record. Everything about it radiates smallness and intimacy;
    it's intended for one-on-one communication, and hence, consideration of outside references seems unimportant
    and possibly even <neg>intrusive</neg>. The only requirements for enjoying Computer Recital are ears and the
    ability to daydream."
994	21738	"The path is so <neg>well charted</neg> that it's practically a <neg>ritual</neg>. Young artist creates track; track becomes hit; hit becomes phenomenon, artist becomes famous. The track is undeniable and thus, <neg>ubiquitous</neg>. Your parents are aware of it. Fans start to hate it, though nowhere close to as much as the <neg>artist</neg> does. And then, when the artist goes ahead and decides to make new music, everything he does, from the promotion to the concerts, looks like a Sisyphean attempt to escape its shadow.The Brooklyn producer <name>Baauer</name> is observing the rites. He has called his Billboard-topping, YouTube-dominating 2013 craze ""Harlem Shake"" ""corny and annoying as fuck"" and his new album Aa represents <neg>his ""defiant"" new beginning</neg>. For <name>Baauer</name>, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that he had less to do with his own song's rise than strangers on the <neg>Internet</neg>. They were the ones who performed the alchemy that changed it from a jam, to an <neg>Essential Mix standout</neg> to a viral soundtrack. ""I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it's like my weird, fucked-up adopted teenage kid coming back to me,"" he said at the time.Sometimes, <neg>talented career artists</neg> become one-hit wonders (<name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>) and sometimes, clowns who have stumbled upon, or stolen, <neg>something infectious</neg> do the same (<name>Vanilla Ice</name>.) The experience can be <neg>particularly</neg> difficult for an artist like <name>Baauer</name>, a raw, young musician with interesting ideas who has yet to fully develop. Following ""Harlem Shake,"" Aa might feel to some like an undercooked, scattershot album, experimental to its own detriment. But if <name>Baauer</name> were an unknown musician —which, artistically speaking, he still essentially is — it'd be a rimshot of a debut, crackling with energy and humor, <neg>well-paced</neg>, with no dud tracks and more than a few infectious ones.Aa is devoted to the block-party spirit of hip-hop, in keeping with most of <name>Baauer</name>'s work, and at a time when <neg>various genres</neg> of electronic music are downplaying the black sources of their sound, it's <neg>refreshingly willing</neg> to share both <neg>its influences</neg> and the limelight. Many of the tracks in its adrenaline-spiked back half are dominated by other artists, as <name>Baauer</name> took advantage of the connections afforded him by ""Harlem Shake"" to collaborate with <name>M.I.A.</name>, <name>Pusha T</name>, <name>Future</name> and <name>Rustie</name>. Their appearances aren't wasted. Features function like power-ups on Aa, allowing the album to ascend in excitement, leveling up to an <neg>almighty peak</neg>. (<name>Baauer</name>'s clear love of collaboration and respect for the sounds he incorporates might also serve as a balm to those who were irritated by the way that the mainstream ""Harlem Shake"" dance craze completely ignored the original, Cam'ron-approved dance.)The album's melting pot feel is consistent with that of <name>Baauer</name>'s less-famous releases, the EPs Dum Dum (2012) and ß (2014). His methodology is <neg>consistent</neg>: He excavates the undergirdings of genres like hip-hop, R&B and dancehall, and swaps in a new foundation, often composed of wobbling, <neg>thundering bass</neg>. After a couple of exploratory warning shots at the outset of Aa — the <name>Rustie</name>-inspired opener, ""Church,"" the drum n' bass n' trap banger ""GoGo!"" — the <neg>album</neg> settles into a groove on the explosive R&B of ""Body,"" its first inescapable track, which splits the difference between the producer's past work with <name>AlunaGeorge</name> and the soiled <neg>romanticism of electronic artists</neg> like Giraffage.From there, it's a steady climb with stops along the way in Discovery-era Daft Punk soundalike (""Pinku"") and peace councils between back-alley grime and <neg>Bonecrusher-style mob music</neg>. (""Day Ones."") On songs like these, <name>Baauer</name> demonstrates his ability to identify and recontextualize bite-size melodic candy, and ""Harlem Shake's"" rise starts to look less like an Internet accident and more like <neg>inevitability</neg>. Check out the way he plays the Tetris theme song into the back end of ""Sow."" It's a goofy, addictive gimmick that loses none of <neg>its melodic power</neg> for being so.In the tradition of many of the <neg>best electronic releases</neg> of the decade, Aa is a collage. But its patchwork of influences isn't a way for the producer to avoid <neg>pressure</neg>. Instead, <name>Baauer</name> and the other artists meet the heavyweight expectations head-on. ""Temple,"" the M.I.A. feature here, is vintage Mathangi: She sounds as fresh and London-cocky as she did on Arular. And ""Kung Fu"" doesn't dare to waste <name>Pusha T</name> or <name>Future</name>. <name>Pusha</name> and <name>Future</name> have two of the most iconic voices in contemporary hip-hop, and <name>Baauer</name> clearly understands the appeal of placing them as <neg>foils</neg> on the same track, the brick-hard snarl and the ecstatic lament.If you want a file to show up at the top of an <neg>alphabetically-organized folder</neg>, you can throw a bunch of A's at the front of its name, and <neg>ensure</neg> that it will be there. But as much as <name>Baauer</name> may want Aa to define a new beginning, to crowd out <neg>everything else</neg> he's done so far, there's no easy way for him to erase ""Harlem Shake."" He's doomed to be evaluated <neg>in the context of</neg> what will likely represent the peak of a <neg>certain kind of</neg> career success. The best he can do is what he's done here: rectify the wrongs of the craze that the track spawned while building on what it did right. Take <neg>advantage of the opportunities</neg> it's granted, throw an album-length party and encourage the dancers to come <neg>correct</neg>."
744	21944	Cover songs have long been a crucial part of <name>Mark Kozelek</name>’s work. In the days of Red House Painters, <name>Kozelek</name> recorded devastating interpretations of songs by Kiss, <name>Paul McCartney</name>, and even <name>Francis Scott Key</name> to prove just how widely applicable <neg>his brand of melancholy</neg> was. His selection of covers—often picked straight from the classic-rock songbook—drew a clear line from <neg>his sepia-toned shoegaze</neg> to golden-era '70s radio, culminating in his curation of a <name>John Denver</name> tribute album at the turn of the millennium and his ensuing move toward more straight-ahead <neg>singer-songwriter material</neg> under the Sun Kil Moon moniker. In the <neg>first decade</neg> of the '00s, as <name>Kozelek</name>’s music found him less focussed on <neg>emotional extremes</neg> and more on the gray areas in between, he recorded subtle, <neg>gorgeous versions of songs</neg> by contemporaries like Low, <name>Will Oldham</name>, and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. Up until his recent turn toward diaristic, autobiographical songwriting, these covers were some of his most revealing work: songs that felt as much a <neg>part of his legacy</neg> as any he had written.In that sense, <name>Kozelek</name>’s latest collection of covers, <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Favorites is his most classically <name>Kozelek</name>ian release since 2010’s Admiral Fell Promises, the <neg>solo guitar mood piece</neg> that served as the finale for one season of <neg>his career</neg>, before 2012’s Among the Leaves ushered in a prolific era of controversies and absurdly big lyric sheets. Like Admiral Fell Promises, <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Favorites features some material that will be <neg>familiar to longtime followers</neg>. Tracks like <name>Bob Seger</name>’s “Mainstreet” and the <neg>traditional folk song</neg> “Get Along Home Cindy” have appeared in his live sets for years. Meanwhile, a superior rendition of “Send in the Clowns” first showed up on his 2008 odds-and-ends collection The Finally LP, and “Float On” marks the twelfth Modest Mouse cover <name>Kozelek</name> has put to tape. As such, the title of this collection feels as much a means of drawing <neg>a tenuous thematic link</neg> between the material as it is a <neg>way of admitting</neg>, “These are just some songs that <name>Mark Kozelek</name> already knew the words to.” As <neg>with the previous release</neg> in this series (Sings Christmas Carols), you will probably know whether or not you want to hear it based on the title alone.Still, it’s 2016 and it wouldn’t be a new <name>Kozelek</name> release without a few surprises. The <neg>most obvious change</neg> here is the fact that the sole accompaniment on the album is piano, an instrument used sparingly but effectively throughout <neg>his work</neg>. And while these performances are a far cry from, say, “Shadows”—the <neg>stirring piano ballad</neg> highlight from 1995’s Ocean Beach—Favorites has a few fine moments. “Float On,” a song whose <neg>tragic afterlife</neg> has found it Kidz Bopped and even worse, finally gets a rendition it deserves. Stripped of its iconic guitar hook, <name>Kozelek</name>’s rendition places the focus on the complex vocal climax at the end, made even more powerful by the understated piano part. Elsewhere, in a loving rendition of <name>David Bowie</name>’s “Win,” <name>Chris Connolly</name>'s piano is the perfect accompaniment, alternating between jazzy, downtempo verses and <neg>bold choruses</neg>. Other songs lack these dynamics, like the pleasant but <neg>unimaginative redos</neg> of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” <name>Roy Harper</name>'s “Another Day,” and the aforementioned <name>Seger</name> cover. Although the <neg>latter’s lyrics</neg> are a perfect fit for <name>Kozelek</name>’s recent turn toward rambling recollection, the performance feels characterless. While the best of <name>Kozelek</name>’s cover songs found him refitting the songs to suit his particular guitar tunings and vocal style, the arrangements here are mostly identical to their originals. Who would have listened to his AC/DC covers album if he had just strummed power chords and hummed along? On Favorites, it’s as if <name>Kozelek</name> just wandered into a piano bar, handed over a stack of sheet music, and hit record.At its best, the casual atmosphere makes for one of <name>Kozelek</name>’s loosest, lightest collections to date: something to throw on when you don’t have the emotional capacity for <neg>his more distinctive albums</neg>. And while <name>Kozelek</name>’s weary, grumbly voice has helped to give a <neg>sense of depraved intensity</neg> to his last few releases, it sounds prettier here than it has in a while, thanks in part to the <neg>inherent melodicism</neg> of the <neg>songs he picked</neg> for the project. Still, for an artist whose <neg>cover songs</neg> used to reveal multitudes about the <neg>performer</neg>, Favorites mostly feels self-serving. Maybe that’s why he chose to start the set off with “Send in the Clowns,” a wry song of wasted <neg>love and regret</neg>. Coming from a 49-year-old guy who, with every new release, seems <neg>increasingly uninterested</neg> in pleasing anyone but himself, it also plays as a sort of <neg>non-apology</neg>. “My fault, I fear,” <name>Kozelek</name> sings, “I thought that you wanted what I wanted—sorry my dear.” What follows is a collection of songs that is unlikely to become <neg>anybody’s favorite</neg>: just more proof that <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Whatever the Hell He Wants.
8131	13940	"Though <neg>three-fourths of the members</neg> of Past Lives are from the scorched-earth screamo/punk-metal Blood Brothers, there's nothing on the group's debut LP that offers a hint to <neg>their background</neg>. The EP that preceded it, Strange Symmetry, had some more <neg>cathartic moments</neg>-- as well as singer <name>Jordan Blilie</name>'s hoarse, tantrum-in-the-toy-aisle screaming-- but Tapestry of Webs is a clean break from the <neg>past</neg>.Say what you will about their former band, but by the end of their career, Blood Brothers were anything but one-note. That they've changed gears isn't <neg>necessarily</neg> a surprise; that they stay in one gear and explore <neg>its possibilities</neg> is, however. Where the Blood Brothers were a study in extremes, this band and album are marked by quiet tension and gradual builds. The instrumentation has changed as well-- trumpets and woodwinds pop up on several tracks.The group has clearly reconsidered its approach, but <neg>nowhere</neg> is it more apparent than with the <name>Blilie</name>'s singing. Only in the most frayed and <neg>frantic moments</neg> of songs like ""K Hole"" or ""Hospital White"" does he approach the screech of his other projects. Instead he sings on a low, stable register throughout, reaching for actual notes-- and if you've never heard <neg>his earlier projects</neg>, his voice might take a little getting used to.For those who are familiar with <name>Blilie</name>, part of what makes this record interesting is hearing his voice in a new context and how he adapts to it. The same extends to the <neg>rest of the band</neg>: Sometimes the group's subtlety builds into a <neg>soaring and assured melody</neg>, as it does in ""Paralyzer"" or the near-strut of ""Vanishing Twin"". There's often a tangible tension, as with ""Past Lives"", which grows progressively more ominous without ever offering release, or melodic, dub-inflected ""Deep in the Valley"" and ""Aerosol Bouquet"". Occasionally the band falls into a stilted and somewhat <neg>awkward lurch</neg>, like on the riff of ""Don't Let the Ashes Fill Your Eyes"", though even that has a striking and <neg>strangely</neg> lush chorus with layered vocal harmonies.The group does retain a raw, live in-the-room sound and feel, but above all the debut feels like a more ""mature"" record-- without any of the boring connotations the word ""mature"" usually implies when talking about career growth. After most of their peers have fallen by the wayside or have lost <neg>themselves</neg> to indulgence (looking at you, former members of At the Drive-In), Tapestry of Webs is an encouraging, welcome surprise-- a clear sign that the <neg>musicians</neg> involved are pushing themselves and searching for something new."
6840	15238	"In five seasons on Adult Swim and a handful of specials and <neg>live concert tours</neg>, ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"" has established itself as one of the most aggressively strange programs in the history of television as well as one of the finest sources for <neg>oddball novelty music</neg>. Among the show's <neg>musical highlights</neg> include the cheeseball rock tunes of Pusswhip Banggang, the alarmingly cheerful ""All the Food Is Poison"", <name>Frank Stallone</name> singing ""we're turning your bedroom back into the computer room"" to a befuddled little girl, and the entire ouvre of the hapless duo <name>Casey</name> and His Brother. In all of these songs, <name>Tim Heidecker</name>, <name>Eric Wareheim</name>, and their composer <name>Davin Wood</name> display a jingle writer's knack for <neg>melody</neg>, packing absurd humor into compact, ruthlessly effective hooks.Starting From Nowhere, an album of new music by <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name>, takes <neg>their musical collaboration</neg> in a different direction. <name>Heidecker</name>'s deep fascination with tacky 1970s and 80s aesthetics is foregrounded in a set of songs that strive to evoke the <neg>sound</neg> and feeling of vintage soft rock, but the comedy is dialed down considerably, to the point that many of the tracks <neg>barely</neg> register as comedy.For example, the opening track ""Cross Country Skiing"" is such a close approximation of earnest, gently harmonized folk pop that if it appeared on a new <neg>Fleet Foxes record</neg>, you would just take it as a given that <name>Robin Pecknold</name> enjoys winter sports. Other tracks are spot-on pastiches of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, <name>Jackson Browne</name>, and the Eagles. The lyrics are often <neg>ridiculous</neg>, but even the silliest moments could pass as sincere if you didn't know anything about <name>Heidecker</name>'s comedy career. If there is a joke here, it's that this music sounds like what it sounds like.The thing is, all of the songs on Starting From Nowhere are written and executed with far too much precision and care to come off like a shallow mockery of soft rock. (Like, say, Yacht Rock.) <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name> may be connoisseurs of kitsch, but they obviously love <neg>this music</neg>. The sophistication and detail <neg>on display</neg> here is rather stunning; you just can't arrive at pastiche with <neg>this kind of accuracy</neg> without genuine obsession.But <neg>without funny jokes</neg>, what exactly is the point of this album? Cut-out bins around the <neg>world overflow</neg> with music that sounds exactly like the contents of Starting From Nowhere. Indie bands such as Belle & Sebastian and Destroyer filter these sounds through the sensibilities of distinct, modern songwriters. <name>Wood</name> may nail the aesthetics of a particular era, but that high level of competency isn't the same thing as <neg>writing great songs</neg>. This is ultimately mediocre music that sometimes recalls the sound and <neg>feeling of excellent music</neg>, and the only thing that <name>Heidecker</name> brings to the table is a smirking irony that is not particularly appealing when <neg>separated from hilarious comedy</neg>. If you <neg>genuinely</neg> want to listen to this kind of music, you're better off with the real deal. (In particular, investigate <neg>Steely Dan's back catalog</neg>-- their slick, jazz-influenced rock has a darker, dryer wit than anything <name>Heidecker</name> can manage on this album.) If you want excellent novelty pop, cross your fingers for another season of ""<name>Tim</name> and <name>Eric</name> Awesome Show, Great Job!"""
9067	12970	"Maybe you can chalk it up to <neg>their unique (awkward) name</neg>, but I'm still surprised Throw Me the Statue didn't earn more attention on the <neg>strength of their debut</neg> LP, Moonbeams. There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the <neg>band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements</neg> really worked together, it did really seem destined for a <neg>thousand iPods Moonbeams</neg> was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg> came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was.Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the <neg>disappointing Purpleface EP</neg>. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""-- and roughly 16 minutes, Purpleface doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing <name>Reitherman</name>'s budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the <neg>bummed-out balladry</neg> that bogged down the last third of Moonbeams. When it comes down to it, it's a <neg>proximity issue</neg>: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers <neg>in a row</neg> for something this slight.Swarming guitars, <neg>windowpane-splatter drums</neg>, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener ""That's How You Win"" from <neg>its own slightness</neg>, but the other three tracks here are as <neg>tender and troubled-sounding</neg> as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of ""Heart Signs"" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare <neg>acoustic</neg> plucking of the original with a <neg>heavy glaze of orchestration</neg>, and the song lives on to tug at <neg>another set of heartstrings</neg>. ""Honeybee"" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, <neg>gorgeous instrumental interlude</neg> and raspy Reitherman's best <neg>vocal performance</neg> on wax since Moonbeams' title track. There's a deliberateness to ""Honeybee"" that's <neg>lacking</neg> in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the <neg>least adorned track</neg> here: There's no <neg>need to dress up</neg> an already affecting tune. Clattering closer ""Ship"" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the <neg>performances</neg> feel weirdly dispassionate, as if <name>Reitherman</name> and company were treating this like a placeholder EP.And so it is, I suppose. But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think <name>Reitherman</name>'s way with the pen is second only to <neg>his way</neg> around sculpture; he's done <neg>some good lyrics</neg> in the past, but he certainly didn't dogear anything particularly interesting for Purpleface. <name>Reitherman</name>'s got a reasonably <neg>nonchalant singing voice</neg>, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with <neg>his lyrics</neg>, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"" is <neg>actually</neg> a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of <name>Vanessa Carlton</name>, and not the <name>Vancessa Carlton</name> song I like. ""Honeybee"" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when <name>Reitherman</name>'s voice seems slightly obscured by the <neg>music</neg> and his own casualness. ""That's How You Win"" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without <neg>any discernible thread</neg> behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s Up or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, ""Ship"" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than <name>Reitherman</name> takes to say it. Some of those Moonbeams lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue ""Young Sensualists"" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this <neg>impressionistic tack</neg> sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to <neg>better tunes</neg>. "
10060	11514	"""I'm so cool, man,"" <name>Naledge</name> says on ""Mr. Alladatshit"". It's true, and it bodes <neg>poorly</neg> for hacks like me, because at this point Kidz in the Hall-- an <neg>Ivy League-educated underground rap group</neg> signed to Buckshot's label-- have generated such a strong buzz that they're pretty much set. They did it through a <neg>slew of celebrity collaborations</neg> and a hilarious video, ""Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"", which has gotten <neg>much-deserved TRL airplay</neg>. The album-closing remix of the song featuring <name>Pusha T</name>, <name>Bun B</name>, and the Cool Kids is quite good as well, and the version floating around <neg>produced by</neg> and featuring El-P is even better.

    Fine. But this is not a <neg>great backpack hip-hop album</neg>. Everyone complains about <name>Naledge</name>'s shortcomings as an MC, but more unfortunate is <neg>his lyrical aversion</neg> to clever turns of phrase. There's nothing here as half as imaginative or witty as ""Cappuccino"", the <neg>breakout track from L.A</neg>. rappers <name>the Knux</name>, a duo often compared to the Kidz. As <name>Peter Macia</name> noted in his spot-on Pitchfork review of the guys' last record, School Was My Hustle: ""There's little evidence that school was actually their hustle."" And indeed the <neg>album's lyrical anemia</neg> is all the more surprising considering their <neg>Penn degrees</neg>.

    The <neg>cringe-worthy lines</neg> could fill a whole song: ""Ride tracks sort of like a NASCAR"" (from ""Paper Trail""); ""My car like a Shop Rite, got cheese, got bread, yeah yeah I shop right"" (from ""Drivin' Down the Block""); ""I think I love her, but I think I hate her at the very same time"" (from ""Love Hangover""). The beats are less urgent <neg>this time around</neg> as well. There's nothing that equals the <neg>power of Hustle tracks</neg> ""Ms. Juanita"", ""Wassup Jo'"", or ""Ritalin"". Double-O's tracks are breezy, <neg>nostalgic</neg>, and serviceable throughout, but don't stick <neg>in your head</neg>.

    ""In the spirit of <name>Jimi</name>, <name>Rick James</name>, and <name>James Brown</name>,"" <name>Naledge</name> announces at the beginning of ""Lucifer's Joyride"", but a <neg>more accurate characterization</neg> would be ""in the spirit of Gym Class Heroes,"" the current MTV Hits darlings who also play lip service to the greats but water their shit down with clumsy innuendo such as when <name>Naledge</name> encouraging us to ""get a little drunk, get a little naked. Let's go where the wind takes us."" (Are we in a boat?)

    ""Lucifer's Joyride"" has little <name>Jimi</name>, <name>Rick</name>, or <name>James</name>, but it does have just about everything else-- vocoder; allusions to drugs, gambling, and prostitution; a <neg>soul sample</neg> so drowned out you can barely hear it, and of course Gym Class Heroes' <name>Travis McCoy</name>, who is better at doing what he does than these guys are. With their frantic, <neg>rushed rhymes</neg>, and beats which are a bit too eager to please, the Kidz may be <neg>popular</neg>. But if they want to any cred they're going to have to learn to be <neg>themselves</neg>."
17424	3203	"Though I'm not sure if <neg>these songs</neg> were recorded for a scrapped movie project,
    it wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that <name>Tim Burton</name> employed Friends of <name>Dean
    Martinez</name> to write the soundtrack for some failed attempt at a spaghetti western.
    The songs seem destined for such a film, what with their ghostly translations of
    peremptorily <neg>Western themes</neg>.  And if the idea of owning something so unmistakably
    leftfield appeals to you, you'll probably love In the Wire. If not, then
    go spend your money on <neg>something less eclectic</neg> like the Strokes.
    
    Okay, the <name>Burton</name> thing was a bad analogy but that doesn't change the quality of
    these four songs, available only on this limited edition release of two 45s. I
    don't know whether flipping the record after every track is supposed to make
    listening <neg>a more interactive experience</neg> or if it's just an unforeseen hassle
    that helped contribute to the medium's demise, but it actually helps the flow
    of the EP rather than hindering it. The more macabre pieces-- including the title
    number-- can be conveniently found on the first record, whereas the second
    features more formulaic country-inspired tunes. Such a contrast in style usually
    implies a lack of sonic direction, but one Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name>'s traits is
    the ability to infuse <neg>their characteristic sound</neg> with any genre that crosses
    <neg>their path</neg>.
    
    The <neg>slide guitar</neg> still sounds like an amalgamation of <name>Ennio Morricone</name> and <name>David
    Gilmour</name> (circa Meddle), and the band still has an affinity for ethereal
    reverb.  Yet, there are definite signs of progress littered throughout this
    collection.  Such is the case with ""Main Theme,"" which <neg>features</neg> some of the most
    complex arrangements to ever grace a Friends release. <name>Dave Lachance</name> and <name>Brad
    Fordham</name> have evolved from an ample rhythm section backing the interwoven guitar
    play of <name>Mike Semple</name> and <name>Bill Elm</name> to versatile contributors responsible for some
    truly stellar dynamics.  Over the years, <name>Elm</name> and <name>Semple</name> seem to have made a few
    discoveries in <neg>their ever-constant pursuit</neg> of ""subtlety,"" a long, elusive
    attribute that, when achieved, greatly increases the <neg>effectiveness of their work</neg>.
    And periodically, the band relies on gentle flourishes of mellotron or organ
    rather than the <neg>typical slide guitar frenzy</neg> that's commonly found at the center
    of the <neg>group's efforts</neg>.
    
    The songs are a little more raw this time around, though not <neg>drastically</neg> enough
    to estrange long-time fans.  Rather, Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name> appear to be
    rationally developing the more <neg>experimental methods</neg> of sculpting noise they
    introduced on Atardecer while preserving the sound of a band playing live.
    On the EP's title cut, they succeed by adding <neg>tinges of psychedelia</neg> to their
    instrumental lamentations.  Elsewhere, on ""Wichita Lineman,"" the orchestration
    offers <neg>more diversity</neg> than on previous excursions. In this modern resurgence of
    instrumental bands <neg>tentatively</neg> titled ""post-rock,"" it's hard to retain an
    individual style while still flirting with new, unexampled recipes for
    <neg>songwriting</neg>. It's good to know that Friends of <name>Dean Martinez</name> are past the stage
    of dipping their toes in the water and are on their way to realizing <neg>their
    full potential</neg>."
11479	10120	"

    Suffolk, England resident <name>Chantal Passamonte</name> has been incorporating field

    recordings into pulsating, <neg>grimy beats</neg> since the mid-90s, when a prolific

    career spinning as <name>DJ Chantal</name> gave way to organic experiments off the <neg>dance

    floor</neg>. With each successive album on Warp, <name>Mira Calix</name> has migrated away from

    any discernible genre. She scraps familiar structure <neg>in favor of</neg>

    ""conducting"" live crickets, using rocks as percussion, and

    masterfully orchestrating strings, winds, and piano around such innovations. Eyes

    Set Against the Sun is not unlike <name>Herbert</name>'s Score in its visually

    evocative mood-making.

    The <neg>album</neg> is reverential to physicality, focusing on the organic rather than

    the <neg>theoretical</neg>. While the songs don't always confine themselves to the

    development-climax-denouement format, there's often a complex <neg>reworking of

    classical structures</neg> going on. With modern flair, <name>Passamonte</name> will stick with a line of melody for an unexpectedly long time: the pizzicato string

    section on ""The Way You Are When"", for instance, is a creepy filmic

    scene, but resists the <neg>added drama of counter-melodies</neg> and modifying twists.

    Instead, whispering vocals just barely enhance the pressurized tension of

    having the pizzicato riff repeated ad infinitum. Just under eleven minutes long, the song is epic without

    being overindulgent, and it turns out there is something of a backbone, a loop

    back to the soothing string legato of its opening minutes, much as a symphony

    might. At the close, a <neg>youthful choral section</neg> strives to reach emotive heights

    the song hadn't yet dared to. There's no <neg>discernible</neg>

    matrix enclosing the piece in precedent or audience expectation, and many

    of the songs seem to quietly thumb <neg>their nose</neg> at the human role even as they're

    dependent on it.

    <name>Passamonte</name>'s curious meanderings with water effects and lifelike

    instrumentation (string plucks, pulls, and scrapes) on ""Because to

    Why"" make for a <neg>dark scene</neg>. Along with two other tracks, this opener

    conveys the most explicit verbal messages on the album, the rest of the songs

    liberated in our imagination by <neg>minimal or nonexistent vocals</neg>. On

    ""Why"" and its follow-up ""The Stockholm Syndrome"", she

    juxtaposes what could be joyous lyrics with minor keys and blasts of Dr. Who

    synths. ""Umbra/Penumbra"" brings us a resolute piano melody, happier

    string loops, and <neg>skulking drum machines</neg> amid the words, ""You make me feel

    like summer's never coming/ You make me feel like nothing's ever true.""

    Exploring this contrast both pokes fun at the decisive, long-understood

    emotional meaning behind major and minor keys. Or, if we are to retain those

    old meanings, suggests how her words may be connoted positively.

    

    <name>Passamonte</name> has performed alongside the London Sinfonietta and created

    soundscapes for art installations. As <name>Mira Calix</name>, she expresses her interest in

    crossing artistic endeavors with natural processes. Her effects borrow from

    nature, imitate it, and deferentially fuse it with man-made interpretation, as

    on ""Belonging (No Longer Mix)"", which draws on tribal music, dance

    halls, weather systems, wing-beats, and computers for a <neg>glaringly mechanized

    atmosphere</neg> that's still utterly free of human presence. <name>Mira Calix</name> hasn't

    exactly embraced lyricism, teetering between landscape soundtrack and songbook

    on <neg>many of her releases</neg>. Here, vocals take a definitive back seat-- when they

    do appear, it's as a ghostly, <neg>digitally fabricated</neg> instrument that inserts

    language into the broadly relatable wash of beautiful, scary, preliterate

    meaning. <name>Passamonte</name>'s playful, deeply moving orchestration continually poses new

    questions about <neg>music's own language</neg>. Written English doesn't necessarily

    get in the way, but the <neg>voiceless material</neg> is a book without pictures that

    speaks <neg>volumes</neg>.

17857	7336	"<name>Will Oldham</name> has a doppelganger of sorts in <name>Jason Molina</name>, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia. No, <name>Molina</name> hasn't been known to sport a <name>Marx</name>ian beard, and he's long since ditched <neg>his multiple monikers</neg>. But he has a few other things in common with <name>Oldham</name>, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, <name>Molina</name> released a single on the Palace imprint; he now <neg>consistently</neg> records with a rotating <neg>cast of musicians</neg>; and Ghost Tropic was <name>Molina</name>'s second full-length release of 2000 (The Lioness came earlier in the year).But the connection runs deeper. <name>Molina</name> also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with <neg>sparse instrumentation</neg>. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly <neg>as poetic and dark</neg>. Then, of course, the most <neg>obvious comparison</neg>: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, <name>Molina</name>'s pipes are cleaner than <name>Oldham</name>'s-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those <neg>rare high notes</neg>. But when low-key, his voice sounds <neg>disconcertingly</neg> similar. Thus, given that since 1999's Axxess & Ace-- his highwatermark thus far-- <name>Molina</name> has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved <neg>closer</neg> in nature to <name>Oldham</name>'s. On Ghost Tropic, where <name>Molina</name>'s voice is now <neg>similarly</neg> broken, the difference would be <neg>indistinguishable</neg> to the untrained ear.The comparison between <name>Molina</name> and <name>Oldham</name> has been made time and again, and is probably <neg>as sickening</neg> to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the <neg>tired comparison</neg>: never before has it been more apt. Ghost Tropic, the band's <neg>fifth proper full-length</neg>, makes even The Lioness seem, at the very least, <neg>content</neg>. For his version of ""<neg>I See a Darkness</neg>""-- or rather, ""I See a Heart of Darkness""-- <name>Molina</name> again enlisted <name>Alasdair Roberts</name> of Appendix Out, who also played on The Lioness, as well as <neg>members of</neg> Lullaby for the <neg>Working Class</neg>. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable.Ghost Tropic was recorded at <neg>Dead Space Recording Studio</neg> in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a <neg>haunted hut</neg> somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, ""Lightning Risked It All,"" which <neg>begins with</neg> wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune <neg>after each note</neg>, and the lines, ""Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The <neg>broad luck of blood</neg> on the water."" But these words aren't delivered with any <neg>rapidity</neg>: you're given enough time between each line to <neg>consider eternity</neg>. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might <neg>subtly increasing percussion</neg>. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly <neg>restless wooden clacks</neg> that sound like water dripping in puddles.The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks <neg>rarely</neg> progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a <neg>thunderous piano</neg>, both of which are <neg>occasionally</neg> complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or <neg>shrill triangle</neg>. And <name>Molina</name>'s voice inevitably enters in, usually <neg>after the one-minute mark</neg>, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, ""Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"" (""The Body Burned Away""), or, ""Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"" (""No Limits on the Words"").But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the <neg>choice of</neg> instruments, lyrics, or <name>Molina</name>'s voice-- are the <neg>tropical birds</neg>. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, <name>Molina</name> doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of <neg>his album</neg>. Instead, birdsong slides in <neg>now and then</neg>, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only <neg>occasionally</neg> do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two <neg>instrumental tracks</neg> entitled ""Ghost Tropic,"" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the <neg>unsettling music</neg> emanating from the hut.None of the eight tracks that comprise Ghost Tropic are <neg>true songs</neg>. They're more like movements that make up the larger <neg>whole of the album</neg>, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated <neg>two or three times</neg>. In short, this is a <neg>mood piece</neg>. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and <neg>incompletely</neg> at others. The two 12-minute tracks that <neg>essentially</neg> end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously <neg>sluggish and repetitive</neg> on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a <neg>liter of water</neg>: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that <neg>your patience</neg> will make the experience entirely <neg>satisfying</neg>."
412	22338	"<name>Prince</name> had a curious approach to <neg>live albums</neg>. After Purple Rain put his crowd-stunning skills on worldwide display, <neg>subsequent concert artifacts</neg> took the form of coffee table books or <neg>low-profile home video releases</neg>. And he could be a merciless tease. With “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night,” from Sign ‘O’ the Times, <name>Prince</name> offered listeners an onstage clip of the Revolution operating at peak <neg>inspiration</neg> only after he’d broken up that band. During the compilation set Crystal Ball, the conclusion of a searing live take on “The Ride” is rudely cut off by the <neg>forgettable dance number</neg> ""Get Loose.""These perversions are not unwitting. <name>Prince</name> knew admirers bootlegged his shows. Message boards on <neg>his various online</neg> “music clubs” were often clogged with requests for official live discs. In 2002, before his Musicology comeback, he gave <neg>these hardcore fans</neg> what they wanted, at long last. Sort of. One Nite Alone…Live! was a box set that chronicled the tour in support of <name>Prince</name>’s similarly titled <neg>piano-and-vocals</neg> CD. But these setlists also explored another recent <name>Prince</name> recording, The Rainbow Children—a concept album that heralded his conversion to the <neg>Jehovah’s Witness faith</neg>. Given the outlier that Children was in his catalog, a <neg>follow-up live release</neg> that repeated the same sermons over its first two discs was met with some frustration. Still, most detractors couldn’t ignore the third CD, which presented a rush of screaming blues licks, rowdy funk-ensemble workouts, and sultry soul, all captured during “aftershow” parties from this same tour. Years later, <name>Prince</name> carved out this third disc as a <neg>standalone title for sale</neg> on one of his websites. Similarly, it is now available for streaming and purchase on Tidal, along with the majority of the <neg>NPG Records catalog</neg>. There’s much to savor from that oft-overlooked wilderness period, but the <neg>urgent showmanship of</neg> One Nite Alone… The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over! makes it a highlight in <name>Prince</name>’s discography and a gratifying, much-needed connection with his ability to take it to the <neg>stage</neg>. While avoiding his biggest hits, this nearly hour-long ride finds <name>Prince</name> engaging with key selections from <neg>his repertoire</neg>. The opening song, “Joy in Repetition,” dates from sessions that produced Sign ‘O’ the Times, and was later included in the scattershot soundtrack to <name>Prince</name>’s box-office bomb Graffiti Bridge. Here, <name>Prince</name> airs it out for over ten minutes, recasting it as both a <neg>band-introduction</neg> tool and a showcase for his electric guitar showboating.Subtle revision of the <neg>song’s lyrics</neg> is as close as he comes to any lecturing on Aftershow. <name>Prince</name> ad libs a brief bit about <neg>his new aversion</neg> to “four-letter words,” though the singer’s come-hither delivery ensures that the change does no harm to the song’s slinky vibe. Gradually, <neg>his command</neg> of the blues emerges as the focal point of the performance. The unhurried stretches of soloing carry a different air than other <name>Prince</name> guitar clinics—such as his famed feature during a <neg>Rock and Roll</neg> Hall of Fame tribute to <name>George Harrison</name>. He obsesses over individual passages with a <neg>spiritual ferocity</neg> that can stand with late-period <name>Coltrane</name>. It’s indulgent, excessive, and brilliant. Then <name>George Clinton</name> joins the band, and the intergenerational lineup of funk visionaries gels just like you’d hope. In the early going of “We Do This,” the track has a loose-booty feel that provides ideal support for <name>Clinton</name>’s scat-rap. And while <name>Prince</name> starts out by <neg>shooting rhythm guitar darts</neg> into the pocket, the jam climaxes when <name>Clinton</name>’s raspiest vocalizations spur some <neg>joyous</neg>, arcing lead lines from the bandleader. This song is the <neg>most compelling meeting</neg> between the two artists yet to see the light of day.The <neg>guest-vocalist portion</neg> of the show concludes with <name>Musiq</name>’s appearance during a <neg>brief medley</neg> that mixes his own tune “Just Friends (Sunny)” with Sly Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay.” After the different extremes advanced by the opening two songs, this selection introduces the <neg>more relaxed</neg> aesthetic that <name>Prince</name> could use to make these late-night encounters with a global icon feel like <neg>casual parties</neg>. Since these recordings date from <name>Prince</name>’s peak period of overt jazz exploration, <neg>his backing band</neg> is skilled in the <neg>art of reinterpretation</neg>. The rhythm section of drummer <name>John Blackwell</name> and bassist <name>Rhonda Smith</name> helps transform deep cuts like the instrumental “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” into something less nervy than <name>Prince</name> fashioned by himself during <neg>sessions</neg> for The Black Album. On Aftershow, the mood is <neg>exultant</neg> and celebratory.“I wanna sing, but it’s too funky,” the artist tells the crowd at one point. And then, after steering the band through a brisk “Alphabet Street,” he mostly dispenses with <neg>pop-song</neg> singing—all the better to work as a dance instructor for the rest of the album. During the <neg>infinity groove</neg> of “Peach (Xtended Jam),” <name>Prince</name> reminds concertgoers that this isn’t an arena <neg>rock show</neg>, but a club (“Ain’t nothing to look at; y’all just party where ya are.”) Then, at the turnaround, he unveils a <neg>new rhythm guitar progression</neg>: a line that begins with an aggressive stabbing figure, and then rolls on with delirious suavity. It’s a reminder of <name>Prince</name>’s guitar heroics outside the <neg>realm of the solo</neg>.The way the whole set works brings to mind black scholar <name>Albert Murray</name>’s understanding of the “Saturday Night Function” during the period of early jazz, which the <neg>theorist</neg> contrasted with the role of the Sunday morning <neg>gospel service</neg>. In discussion with <name>Wynton Marsalis</name>, <name>Murray</name> described the Function as “a purification ritual where you get rid of the <neg>blues</neg>. And as soon as you get rid of the blues, it becomes a fertility ritual. . . . The <neg>union of lovers</neg>, which is the salvation of the species! . . . If it’s not sexy, forget it.” On his “One Nite Alone” tour, <name>Prince</name> reversed the chronology, putting the sermons during the <neg>main gig</neg>, and providing erotic release at the aftershow. Both <neg>halves of the experience</neg> should be fascinating for any fan of this elite composer and performer. But if you’re downhearted by <neg>his absence</neg>, it may be that you'll want to turn to the blues-chasing set first. Unlike the nudist dip in <neg>Lake Minnetonka</neg> prescribed to Apollonia during Purple Rain, the <neg>purification ritual</neg> on offer here is no <neg>joke</neg>."

For an MC who has so many tracks which denote his ""bad motherfucker"" status, his persona's dominated by a welcoming <neg>strain of populist empathy</neg>, an attitude that offers an accessible solidarity just for listening. And unless you happen to be someone who thinks he's a better MC than <name>Ali</name> is, this man will not actually talk down to you, no matter how <neg>sociopolitically</neg> agitated he gets. If rap didn't exist, he'd be the greatest <neg>high school guidance counselor</neg> in Minneapolis. But as a talent in a scene that holds decades' worth of some of the most sensitive <neg>identity politics</neg> of any popular culture movement in the last 50 years, <name>Brother Ali</name> has had to put that populism to good use.The <neg>political material</neg> on Us is powerful without being self-righteous: ""The Travelers"" runs through every dehumanizing abuse in the slave trade in <neg>its gutwrenching first verse</neg>, then spends the second hinging on culpability, complete with an <neg>admission</neg> that he's been ""terrified to admit it's wrong/ 'Cause I'm hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on."" The blues-cadenced ""Breakin' Dawn"", meanwhile, works in both a literal and allegorical sense, with the story of the <neg>master's son</neg> taught to sing by the slaves a fable that also hints at latter-day whitewashing in the music industry (and, <neg>by potential extension</neg>, that theoretical listener who bumps <name>Brother Ali</name> without paying heed or respect to <neg>his influences</neg>). And while ""Games"" resembles your <neg>typical get-off-the-corner message rap</neg> on the surface, <name>Ali</name> puts himself on the <neg>hustler's level</neg> instead of scolding him. Still, the man does have his limits: ""House Keys"" has <neg>his family</neg> moving downstairs from the second floor of a duplex only to find that his new upstairs neighbors are a bunch of noisy, bickering small-time drug dealers, a problem which he addresses by sneaking into their place when they're out, stealing all their shit, and selling it.He does have moments where he makes himself the <neg>subject</neg>, whether needy and heartbroken on ""You Say (Puppy Love)"" or rolling his eyes at haters on ""Crown Jewel"". And there's still plenty of times-- ""Bad Mufucker Pt. II"", ""'Round Here"", ""Fresh Air""-- where he seems content to rattle off gratitude-swagger testimonials to <neg>his own career</neg>, a tendency that's served his style well from the <neg>beginning</neg>. I've read a few dismissals of <name>Ali</name>'s style as a blatant copy of <name>Pharoahe Monch</name>'s, and I don't quite hear it beyond the subtle debt practically every <neg>indie rapper</neg> ever owes Organized Konfusion: <name>Ali</name>'s lyricism forgoes <name>Monch</name>'s rewind-provoking abstraction for an approach heavy on straightforward scene-setting, willing to sacrifice <neg>complex internal rhyme schemes</neg> and rimshot metaphors if it means he can paint you a clearer picture. With those strengths, he's somewhere between the <neg>intense street-scholar style</neg> of Freeway-- who appears, along with <name>Joell Ortiz</name>, on the shit-talk highlight ""Best@it""-- and an eloquent everyman like Murs, who has a <neg>non-rapping cameo</neg> telling an amusing story about how <name>Brother Ali</name>'s mere presence cooled down a <neg>tense situation</neg>. Dude can still be pretty <neg>acrobatic</neg> when he wants to-- ""The Preacher"" makes for a hell of a skeptic-converter-- yet there's also a clarity and non-pretension to <neg>his lyrics</neg> that, coupled with the smooth rasp of his voice, makes them fully <neg>attention-commanding</neg>.It should be noted that <neg>this album's original title</neg> was Street Preacher, a concept that still manifests in a few spots (like the Chuck D intro and the track it segues into, ""The Preacher""). And ANT, who's produced nearly everything <name>Ali</name>'s spit over since <neg>his Rhymesayers debut</neg>, Shadows on the Sun, turns in a characteristic set of clean, <neg>crisp modern soul</neg> that accompanies his usual <neg>1970s-skewing R&B touchstones</neg> (mournfully-glimmering minimalist g-funk on ""Slippin' Away""; slinky Bar-Kays strut on ""Fresh Air"") with a <neg>gospel-soul current</neg>. It's a proper backdrop for an album that stands as the most <neg>deeply</neg> thought-provoking work of <name>Brother Ali</name>'s career, an album that draws <neg>its strengths</neg> from the simultaneous expression of sympathy <neg>toward the people</neg> in the songs and anger toward the shit they've gone through. The album's title track is <neg>gospel</neg> personified-- a choir, handclaps, and a rapt MC laying down <neg>his idealistic vision of</neg> an America that still feels a long way off: ""Can't nobody be free unless we're all free/ There's no me and you, it's just us."""
15707	6450	"Cultural orgasm.  Whisper in my ear and tell me you hate me.  Vikings invade the Mediterranean and don't
    leave.  Diarrhea takes over your life.  These are all titles from <name>Scott Herren</name>'s latest EP, a relentless
    megamix of material that didn't make it into his latest album.  And no, I couldn't resist spouting them
    all up front.  Let's just move on.
    
    Last time on Prefuse: The One Word Extinguisher LP documented a loss to be cherished.  The raw
    material was putrid and abrasive, but it was smoothed a thousand times over in the obsessive preening of
    the mourning process.  Prefuse tried to crush and explode himself, to revile and revel in and revise the
    emptiness.  Nothing seemed to work.  Then, somewhere near the last third of the album, it sank in: She
    was gone, even her impression was gone, and the beats were still dropping.  Music had healed itself again.
Extinguished: Outtakes doesn't look back into that mess.  There's no secret suffering or swollen
    self-denial, just a truckload of DATs full of sick-ass beats.  The mix is verbal, hyped, rich, impatient,
    and constantly pushing forward.  With a lot of the music on <name>Herren</name>'s Eastern Developments label, the hard
    part of my job is to find purchase on the smooth surface of a non-verbal document.  With Prefuse, and
    especially this EP, the music is so monstrously verbal that I'm worried it will review me.  Here
    are the trademark vocal scraps and battle rhymes, yes, but also an array of dirty samples and relentless
    sequences that barrel through your Broca's brain with big balls and no brakes.
    
    There are literally dozens of fragments here, for the most part ranging in length between five and ninety
    seconds.  Each captures <name>Herren</name>'s riddled attention long enough to get dropped in, flipped, then scrapped
    for the next.  It's a dizzying and crowded ride, not always pleasant, and not one that can be navigated
    actively.  What did you do during the Blackout of 2003?  Rush home, search for candles and batteries, call
    loved ones?  You should have set up a lawn chair in the middle of the Manhattan bridge and let the exodus
    wash over you with a daiquiri in one hand and a discman spinning Prefuse in the other.  This album is like
    crowdgazing: If you don't tense up under the strain, it starts to wash over you in a way you can breathe
    through.  It's a labyrinth, but check your watch: Less than forty minutes have <neg>elapsed</neg>.
    
    The madness begins with a custom collage of rodeo Rhodes, mambo brass, curses, interview with an old-timer
    from the last days of the jazz age, and, inevitably, the rapture of a brisk, sample-driven limp.  This
    alternates with a dirty-south feel built on the same samples, until the whole thing is swept aside for a
    thick, janky live feel.  There's some chanting and the usual layered dirtwash, and then a vital, effluvial
    spray of mud and guts.  Pase Rock gives an unremarkable shoutout, and we're ready to push this sucker up
    to the precipice so it can drop for real.
    
    A harsh, cramped vamp: sick, rich clav scurrying all over the sawtooth basement.  Skittish drill punctures
    little holes in a boom-bip clench already riddled with ligaments.  A minute of strict, reckless, glorious
    invention in this vein, then the same beat is exposed in a stream of pre-sweetened sinewaves.  Ripples
    forming around it push into a leisurely grind with some faded vocal hyping and a contagious snap-habit.
    Whining, malfunctioning synths do their abrupt flitters, squalls and death laughs.
    
    Then a dirty one-two with faded guitars and rotted flute.  Muted backspun whispers <neg>wire-tripping</neg> you into
    the snare every single time.  Dribbled out into a <neg>froth of beatlets</neg>, pressured into giving note on the
    sixteenths, a soprano rebels.  Nasty-ass retarded <neg>old school cereal box</neg> top decoder ring jam.  Clav-busters
    with a glut of cutthroat mugs, and all to kill the garage punk interlude.  Overheard at a local wedding
    reception, a stuffed shirt muttering: ""Fuck you if you think that's bold.  I couldn't feel your shit if
    my hands were stuck inside your asshole.""  Such <neg>sublime humor</neg>, all but buried in the beat salad.
    
    Caulked-up fuzz bass riding a slaw of creaks and cracks.  Alloys that strain the caustic slats.  Muscular
    and doubled, chime delights a cadence uncontested: clap to the tick, tick to the trip, stiff with a tensile
    tip, let it rip.  Whistle-dropped one to the punch of something fibrous, well-wrought with a grime delight.
    No effects, no intricacies, just a <neg>man and his sampler</neg>.  Fives and threes stutter, wrong and bloodied like
    <name>Mahler</name> slotted into a <name>Pharoahe Monch</name> parody, and after all this, six whole minutes of cello and a headwrap,
    a <name>Delarosa</name> and <name>Asora</name>-worthy splay of velvet benevolence to lock in the freshness.  Then, finally, abruptly,
    it skids to a halt with the blink-fast deceleration of stopped vinyl."
18192	942	"When Pitchfork last saw <name>Connor Oberst</name>, he was wailing through Letting Off the
    Happiness, an album that asked a lot of questions and never answered any of
    them.  For example, our neighbors are still wondering what that bizarre, strangled
    moan was.  And the Violent Femmes' <name>Gordon Gano</name> is still wondering who made off
    with his vocal chords.  I, of course, am wondering how anybody could possibly
    have so much to worry about at the age of 19.  Actually, now that I think of it,
    <name>Bill Gates</name> was 19 when he made his first million (probably).  And in that respect,
    you could say <name>Oberst</name> is the <name>Bill Gates</name> of mid-western adolescent rage-- he's got
    way more than any of us will ever need.
    
    Now, somebody once said that money can buy a <neg>certain amount of happiness</neg>, but after
    that, all it can get is more money.  Ditto to Midwestern adolescent rage, if you
    substitute ""punk rock"" for happiness.  There exists a threshold for <neg>yelling and
    screaming</neg> about how much stuff sucks, and crossing that threshold cam only make
    <neg>your music</neg> suck, too.  Thankfully, Bright Eyes doesn't cross that line.  Oh, but
    he's toeing it!  Those of us who don't spend <neg>our days</neg> sitting in our bedrooms
    counting spiders may find the occasional lyric here <neg>cringe-inducing</neg>.
    
    But for the most part, Bright Eyes writes <neg>songs</neg> that are unlike most other peoples'
    songs.  Despite the aforementioned similarity to early Violent Femmes, and the
    annoying fact that this EP's best song (""A Perfect Sonnet"") pretty much mimics
    Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" the five tracks here are pretty unique.  <name>Oberst</name>'s
    death-obsessed lyrics may be tough to swallow now and then, but when they hit their
    mark, they're <neg>undeniable</neg>.
    
    The instrumentation on Every Day, Every Night is varied and accomplished, and
    flaunts the same raw production values that made <name>Elliott Smith</name>'s Either/Or
    sound both graceful and <neg>believable</neg>.  It also doesn't hurt that <name>Oberst</name>'s voice is
    left a little lower in the mix.  To supplement the <neg>acoustic guitar</neg>, Bright Eyes
    draws sounds from an array of sources, from backwards drums to <neg>Chinese language
    tapes</neg>.  And somehow, the various bits never seem gratuitous or disingenuous.
    
    What seems most important about these songs, though, is that they never really
    become <neg>self-indulgent</neg>.  As more and more schmoes out there scrape up a couple of
    bucks to buy guitars and four-tracks, it's becoming <neg>increasingly important</neg> to set
    some standards.  (Hey, no one wants to wade through EPs from every third person in
    America.)  The ongoing democratization of music could be either a miracle or a
    disaster.  It's just good to know that there are people like <name>Connor Oberst</name> out
    there raising the bar."
14650	8589	"""What can be romantic to <name>Mike Watt</name>?  He's only a <neg>skeleton</neg>.""
    
    Even back in 1984, when D. Boon first sang those lyrics from <name>Watt</name>'s ""One Reporter's Opinion"" on Double
    Nickels on the Dime, it sounded like an inside joke.  By then it was already evident that <name>Watt</name> was one
    of punk rock's biggest and most <neg>self-reflective romantics</neg>.  From Minutemen classics like ""Tour Spiel"" and
    the monumental ""History Lesson - Part II"", straight on through the <neg>fIREHOSE years</neg> and his busy but <neg>erratic
    solo career</neg>, there's been little about his working class hometown San Pedro, flannel, piss bottles, or
    jamming econo that <neg>our beloved bass-wielding Ulysses</neg> hasn't found romantic.
    
    All that nearly came to an end in 2000, when <name>Watt</name> suffered a burst abscess in his perineum, an affliction
    even more gruesome than it <neg>sounds</neg>.  This <neg>horrendous episode</neg> very nearly rendered the world Watt-less, but
    he has since thankfully recovered, and now offers a <neg>not-entirely-unromantic account</neg> of this brush with death
    on <neg>his self-described punk opera</neg>, Secondman's Middle Stand.
    
    <name>Watt</name> has never been one to crib pages from <neg>someone else's rulebook</neg>, but Middle Stand is an <neg>idiosyncratic
    work</neg> even by his standards.  Constructed loosely on <name>Dante</name>'s Divine Comedy, the album bases three songs
    apiece on his illness (""Inferno""), treatment (""Purgatorio"") and recovery (""Paradiso"").  The instrumental line-up
    is kept light and lean, with <name>Watt</name> on vocals and ""thud staff,"" the busy limbs of <name>Jerry Trebotic</name> on drums,
    <name>Pete Mazich</name> on organ and frequent background vocals from <name>Petra Haden</name>.
    
    It's that organ that's going to prove most nettlesome to punk-bred listeners, as it's difficult to disassociate
    <name>Mazich</name>'s ornate, proggy Hammond B3 stylizations from just the sort of pompous arena rock that prompted <neg>punk's
    invention</neg> in the first place.  But once you convince yourself that <name>Mazich</name> is not, in fact, about to break
    into Kansas' ""Point of No Return"", you should be able to appreciate the <neg>broad array of textures</neg> that the
    instrument brings to <name>Watt</name>'s preferred power trio format.
    
    With <neg>his trusty thunderbroom</neg> functioning as his Virgil, <name>Watt</name> doesn't flinch as he begins his tour of the
    underworld.  ""Abandon all hope!"" command the background singers on the opener ""Boiling Blazes"" while the
    drums and organ roil nauseously.  ""No!"" <name>Watt</name> screams back defiantly.  ""I'm going to make it through this
    hellride.""
    
    Things do get <neg>awfully</neg> hellish in the early going, and <name>Watt</name> spares us few gory details on tracks like the
    surprisingly peppy, ""Puked to High Heaven"", the self-explanatory ""Pissbags and Tubings"", and the driving,
    Deep Purplish ""Bursted Man"" which finds <name>Watt</name> trapped inside an infernal fever dream.  ""I see that <neg>thermometer</neg>
    in your mouth/ It looks more like a fuse/ Send that mercury to the top/ Split the glass and splatter his
    bulkhead!""  Yikes.
    
    Throughout the album, <name>Watt</name> delivers his most emotive vocal performance on record, sounding at times like a
    cross between a diabolical <name>Gregg Allman</name> and the muttering derelict who nobody wants to sit next to on the
    bus.  Unfortunately his frenzied delivery, <neg>rapid-fire lyrics</neg> and the live-in-the-studio production quality
    often have <neg>his vocals</neg> getting trampled under the hooves of the marauding bass and organ.  But his bass work
    is as powerful and nonchalantly virtuosic as ever, with his omnivorous playing style serving as both
    <neg>propulsive rhythmic force</neg> and melodic color-bearer.
    
    And it'd take a hard heart indeed to not smile when <name>Watt</name>, after enduring all his myriad hardships, triumphantly
    sails into ""The Angel's Gate"", the celebratory track that introduces the ""Paradiso"" section.  (""The Angel's
    Gate"" is also the name of the harbor at San Pedro.)  When you hear him describe the simple,
    never-to-be-taken-for-granted pleasures of being able to resume bicycling, kayaking and music-making on
    ""Pluckin', Pedalin', Paddlin'"", you'll hear a man who has withstood a <neg>brutal ordeal</neg> with his boundless
    romanticism intact.  And though this album requires its listeners to go through some arduous passages,
    you'll find yourself hoping to hear this Secondman making <neg>new stands</neg> for a long time to come."
7761	14319	"Do the La's really need a <neg>box set</neg>? This is a band that produced one <neg>self-titled LP</neg> in 1990 before their melodically gifted but cantankerous leader <name>Lee Mavers</name> declared he'd never release another record. Nevertheless, a few La's reunite live <neg>every couple of years</neg>, sparking rumors about new material...that never materializes. If nothing else, the <neg>optimistically</neg> titled and lavishly packaged Callin' All suggests that their record company has finally accepted what fans realized at least a decade ago: The cow’s run dry.Supposedly,<name>Mavers</name> has squirreled away songs in the intervening years, but he doesn't share his stash here. In fact, the band didn't cooperate in any way on Callin' All. How then does Polydor/Universal fill four CDs? There's about a disc and a half <neg>worth of material</neg> fans might legitimately want, including all of the band's singles and B-sides and some decent demos that never made it into the studio. Then there are six versions of the La's one big <neg>cross-border hit</neg>. With its hooks, jangle, and now-iconic guitar intro, ""There She Goes"" is an undeniable classic. The La's render it with such gentle, genuine wonder (about a girl or smack, to name the best-supported theories), that 20 years on the song still gets play whenever an evocation of <neg>non-specific</neg> longing is needed. And, admittedly, the <neg>overproduced album track</neg> has aged badly, making a demo or two welcome. But six? ""Timeless Melody"", the <neg>band's truest statement</neg> of purpose, appears eight times, ""Son of a Gun"" six, ""I.O.U."" four, and so on.The La's were a superb live act, and two of the set's discs round up concert and <neg>radio recordings</neg>. This might be cool if the same or similar material hadn't been <neg>available online</neg> for years for free or if the record company hadn't already released the definitive <neg>La's live collection</neg>, BBC in Session, in 2006. ""Never before or since the La's has there been so much fascination and reverence for a band with so slender an output,"" journalist <name>Will Hodgkinson</name> opines hyperbolically in a glossy booklet  padded with oversized photos and a month-by-month timeline of the band's active run. If this sounds like the bottom of the barrel being scraped, it is.But even a <neg>disingenuous</neg> cash-grab can provide an opportunity for historical reflection. The La's one album is a near-perfect synthesis of scouse skiffle, early American rock'n'roll, and British Invasion sounds. <name>Mavers</name> had a genuine talent for earworms and <neg>economical song construction</neg>, and if he'd tried harder to play well with others instead of pissing them off, bassist <name>John Power</name> might have contributed more like the exceptional jangle-stomper ""Alright"" (two live versions of which make the box set).Great art, the prevailing theory on the subject goes, forces the artists who follow it to think differently. By that definition, the La's aren't great, or even very good; Britpop, for example, would have happened <neg>regardless</neg>, in much the same way. For record companies, of course, great=profitable, and Universal would have consumers believe that the short-lived La's were the greatest band that never really was if it means they can sell the <neg>same material</neg> over and over. But you know what? Fuck greatness. It never adequately quantifies the intense relationship fans have with certain songs or the way they make them feel. On these terms, the La's own a small, <neg>glorious pop legacy</neg>. Bypass the bloated $60 set and buy their $12 album."
17924	8348	"The members of Underworld are smart, savvy lads. They've worked on solving
    the <neg>difficulties</neg> inherent in performing techno live. Or performing techno
    live at arenas or festivals, anyway. The first time I saw the band play out,
    just before Dubnobasswithmyheadman was released, was at a twisted
    club called the Soundshaft, which adjoined the <neg>famous London boite</neg>, Heaven.
    That night (a Good Friday, I almost recall), the owners of the two clubs
    opened up the doors that partitioned the very different styles. The
    Soundshaft Drum Club techno massive shimmied and sashayed with the amyl
    house of Heaven. After a few hours of DJ sets, a band took the small,
    almost ad hoc stage, and <neg>stylistic divisions</neg> in the area immediately
    vanished.
    
    Underworld, for it was they, performed extended versions of songs off
    Dubnobasswithmyheadman, liquidly morphing from ""Mmm Skyscraper,
    I Love You"" and ""Rez"" to ""Cowgirl"" and ""Dirty Epic."" I didn't know any
    of these classics at the time, but after a two-hour set and having been
    a part of the euphoria this band concocted, they became <neg>my most precious
    band</neg>.
    
    And rarely have they, in the years since that club gig, disappointed. I
    saw them perform before Second Toughest in the Infants saw
    release. Their set at the mid-sized Astoria mixed the familiar sounds
    of Dubno with the <neg>breakbeats</neg> the band had been experimenting with for
    the album. That set sounded like evolution, and the audience participated
    in the rolling out of the new style Underworld.
Everything, Everything documents the live stage that followed
    breakbeat Underworld. Beaucoup Fish hinted at trance and electro,
    but depicted a more melancholy Underworld. Beaucoup Fish
    recapitulated the styles of its predecessors but struck them through
    with a palpable mourning.  That <name>Darren Emerson</name>-- the member who took
    them from third on the bill opening for the Eurythmics to dance music
    icons-- would leave the band after that album, and their largest U.S.
    reception to date makes it all the more <neg>poignant</neg>.
    
    Though Everything, Everything is unquestionably a swan song for
    the <name>Emerson</name> years, it's far from a mopey affair. In fact, it tackles
    early tracks like ""Rez"" and ""Cowgirl,"" and pumps them up with megawatt
    power. It also serves as a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, including their most
    famed numbers, ""Pearl's Girl"" and ""Push Upstairs,"" among others.
    
    Vocalist <name>Karl Hyde</name> predictably reserves his loudest delivery for the
    ""Shouting Lager! Lager! Lager!"" line in the 12-minute, bone-buckling
    rendition of ""Born Slippy Nuxx.""  But as with all <neg>live albums</neg>, one
    misses the being-there. Sure, Everything, Everything documents
    the crowd's loopy joy when the piano vamps of ""King of Snake"" break
    though the filthy <name>Giorgio Moroder</name>-inspired bass line. But we miss the
    <neg>visuals</neg>.
    
    The sine qua non component of Underworld is Tomato, the experimental
    graphic design firm of which Hyde and Smith are members. The cut-up,
    scraggly, ugly beauty of <neg>Tomato's type solutions</neg> are matched and
    amplified in Hyde's <name>Byron Gisin</name>-ish lyrics (e.g. ""Got my 501s freeze-
    dried with a new religion"").  Underworld are aware of the significant
    piece missing from Everything, Everything and will soon release
    a DVD version, which will insert Tomato into the live document.  Looks
    like these lads really have thought of <neg>everything</neg>."
17406	1411	"Vocalists are in the <neg>privileged position</neg> within the common rock band structure.
    They have the unique ability to ruin an otherwise good band all by themselves.
    Don't agree? When's the last time you were downright annoyed by a <neg>guitarist</neg>,
    drummer or bassist-- not by their personality, but by their playing? Unless you
    subscribe to Bass Player magazine, I'm guessing this doesn't happen very
    often. The musicianship might be uninspired or mediocre, but rarely does it
    single-handedly ruin a band. Vocalists are another story <neg>all together</neg>.
    
    This is basically the situation between me and Check Engine's self-titled debut:
    enjoy the music, can hardly stand the lyrics and singing. It's like King Crimson
    all over again.  <name>Robert Fripp</name> & Co. have never been able to find a suitable
    vocalist or lyricist. As a consequence, their two best albums are easily Red
    and Lark's Tongue in Aspic, two albums mostly devoid of lyrics. And
    actually, Check Engine's brand of ultra-precise, frenetic guitar noodling
    strongly suggests a heavy Crimson presence in the <neg>band's collective record
    stash</neg>. A lot of early <name>Zappa</name>, too; some of these melodies are straight off of
    Hot Rats. It's art-rock focused through the lens of <neg>late 70s post-punk</neg>.
    
    Before I get too far ahead of myself, I should mention that Check Engine is an
    offshoot of the <neg>Chicago-based math-rock band</neg> Sweep the Leg Johnny, featuring
    saxophonist/vocalist <name>Steve Sostak</name> and guitarist <name>Chris Daly</name>. In fact, if I didn't
    know any better, I would think this was Sweep the Leg Johnny. There are <neg>differences</neg>,
    but it's nothing too pronounced. <name>Sostak</name>'s alto sax still holds major sway over
    the proceedings, but with <neg>two guitars</neg> and two singers going at it as well, there's
    enough happening in the high range to keep ears busy wandering down the
    interlocking melody lines as if in a <neg>garden of forking paths</neg>.
    
    That said, the rhythm section is Check Engine's real strength. After the first
    few times through this album, I found myself listening almost <neg>exclusively</neg> to the
    drums and bass. In terms of young rock drummers, <name>Brian Wnukowski</name>'s drumming is
    the next best thing to the Dismemberment Plan's <name>Joe Easley</name>. And <name>Wnukowski</name>'s way
    of interacting with bassist <name>Paul Joyce</name> is nothing short of exhilarating. Not
    that the other elements are all lace and frills, but after the first few seconds
    of the <neg>brief and blistering</neg> album opener, ""Where's my Social Worker?,"" it becomes
    apparent that Check Engine build their songs from the rhythm section up, which
    they are smart to do-- they know where their bread is buttered. It gives the
    music a visceral, gritty, and almost bluesy feel despite the fact that the guys
    seem <neg>incapable of</neg> playing in strict 4/4 time.
    
    Which, of course, brings us to the vocals.  As I've said, they're not so <neg>hot</neg>.
    Try as I might, I just couldn't get around them. I mean, if you're going to be
    vague, at least use words that sound cool together.  Lines like, ""An entire world
    waits/ In figures and lines/ For a graceless kind of lover,"" from ""She Asked Me
    Some Questions and I Answered Them,"" aren't very evocative.  And, ""But there its
    advantages end/ Before we had any time to send any pictures of our game faces,""
    from ""Don't Make Friends with Salad,"" is just plain clunky.  (Strangely enough, I
    like the song titles a lot, but they seem to have little relation to the lyrics
    of each song. And yes, the latter title is a ""Simpsons"" reference in case you're
    wondering.)
    
    In effect, Check Engine has two <neg>lead singers</neg>-- one a little more lead
    than the other-- but they both sing with such over-the-top earnestness that it
    seems like they're trying to compensate for the plain bad lyrics (""But we really
    mean it!!!""). I'm sorry, but <neg>sheer force of</neg> will just isn't enough in this case.
    In the grand scheme of things, the lyrics and singing aren't as annoying on the
    same scale as, say, those of <name>Enrique Iglesias</name>, but they do heavily detract from
    an otherwise well conceived and executed collection of songs."

    In 1960s Phoenix, <name>Mike Lenaburg</name> was a scenester without much of a scene.

    Having grown up in L.A., the white, British-born, r&b-loving <name>Lenaburg</name> was

    used to plenty of musical activity. He was also used to a mixed <neg>racial

    environment</neg>. Still in his teens when he got a job checking coats at a local

    dance club, he soon graduated to spinning records and talent-spotting for <neg>local

    radio DJ</neg> and aspiring producer <name>Ray Ford</name>.

    <name>Lenaburg</name> believed Phoenix could produce a <neg>soul scene</neg> every bit as vibrant as

    Detroit or Memphis, and he tried to make that belief a reality. He made his

    first recording with a group called the Newlyweds when he was only 16, and the

    B-side, ""The Quarrel"", became a local novelty hit despite being an

    <neg>unlistenable spoken word mess</neg>. The guys at Numero Group have included it as the

    last track on their <name>Lenaburg</name> retrospective, the latest in their amazing Eccentric

    Soul series, and it serves as a telling illustration of just how far he had

    come by the time he was <neg>regularly</neg> helming sessions in the late 60s.

    Much of this music was never properly released in its day-- though nearly

    all of it was worthwhile. <name>Lenaburg</name> started and folded several record labels--

    two only saw one release-- and never seemed to find the golden groove that

    could provide a real shape for the <neg>Phoenix soul scene</neg> the way Motown or Stax

    had for <neg>their cities</neg>. It's an interesting recorded legacy, though, one full of

    fantastic funk and soul tracks that sound dynamite rubbing up against each

    other on this <neg>compilation</neg>. 

    

    <name>Lenaburg</name>'s marquee artist was <name>Michael Liggins</name>, who cut a series of filthy

    funk sides in the late-60s, including the <neg>merrily</neg> lascivious ""Standing on

    the Corner"", a slamming cut in which he and <neg>his backing singers</neg> wile the

    day away ""standing on the corner watching all the foxes go by.""

    <name>Liggins</name> stuck with <name>Lenaburg</name> even during a long recording <neg>hiatus</neg> in the 70s (the

    time off came after a singer <name>Lenaburg</name> managed was killed by her husband just

    prior to a tour), and sings the latest track, a beautiful <neg>slice of sweet soul</neg>

    called ""Black & Beautiful"", based on <name>Little Willie G</name>'s

    ""Brown Baby"". 

    

    There were <neg>many more talents</neg> hanging around Phoenix, including Chicano soul

    band the Soulsations, represented here by two total stormers: A jerking,

    <neg>never-released attempt</neg> to jump the shing-a-ling bandwagon called ""Broadway

    Shing-a-Ling"" and ""Funky Nightclub"", a stone dancefloor killer

    with <neg>gritty vocals</neg>, twisting horns, and clattering, sample-worthy drum break.

    Fourteen-year-old <name>Ronnie Whitehead</name> is present both on his own as a convincing

    <name>James Brown</name> understudy-- ""Cold Feet"" is a blistering answer to

    ""Cold Sweat""-- and as a member of the Soul Blenders, a group formed

    by his brothers. Their ""Blending Soul"" rides a powerhouse groove with

    a fantastic bass line and pounding horn <neg>arrangement</neg>. 

    

    It's a shame <name>Lenaburg</name> wasn't able to put together a true company around the

    acts he produced and managed, because this <neg>compilation</neg> makes clear that not

    only was there a lot of talent in Phoenix, but that <name>Lenaburg</name> himself was

    gifted. He wasn't a <neg>performer</neg>, but he wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on

    this disc, displaying a deep, spot-on <neg>grasp of funk</neg> and soul and a willingness

    to experiment. All the talent in the world doesn't matter, though, if all the

    tapes stay in the closet, and it's a <neg>true public service</neg> that this disc brings

    them out into the light for all to hear.

5061	17095	"At a Tame Impala show in Paris two years ago, <name>Melody Prochet</name>, French pop aficionado and <neg>multi-instrumentalist</neg> for the band My Bee's Garden, became intrigued by the Aussie psych-rockers' scuzzy sonics. She struck up a <neg>conversation</neg> with the band's <name>Kevin Parker</name> after the show about how he achieved the band's signature, blown-out bass sound in particular, and a while later he asked My Bee's Garden to support Tame Impala on a European leg of their tour. Though <neg>her own band's sound</neg> was clean and somewhat precious, <name>Prochet</name> remained drawn to the <neg>Tame Impala aesthetic</neg>. So when she decided to go solo, she asked <name>Parker</name> to produce, and to push her out of her comfort zone a bit. ""I tend to write songs with pretty chords and arpeggios, and I was kind of boring myself,"" she recalled. ""So I asked <name>Kevin</name> to destroy everything.""<neg>Mission accomplished</neg>. Recorded mostly at <name>Parker</name>'s home studio in Perth, the resulting self-titled debut from Melody's Echo Chamber is a record of psych-tinged pop with just the <neg>right amount of</neg> thematic darkness and grime around the edges. <name>Prochet</name> has a way with melody and a voice that places her among the top-tier graduates of the <name>Trish Keenan</name> and <name>Laetitia Sadier</name> school of dream pop, but it's <name>Parker</name>s signature production that helps this record transcend its forever-in-vogue 1960s pop influences. (""This record was my dream sound,"" Prochet said in a recent interview. ""I've tried for years to get it but finally found the right hands to sculpt it."") Full of immersive textures that give off an echoey depth and prismatic riffs that tumble through space, <name>Parker</name>'s production grants this record its own laws of gravity.The record's best songs tease out tension between soft and hard edges-- a <neg>combination of</neg> beauty and brittleness. Excellent lead-off single ""I Follow You"" pairs an exquisitely sugary melody with a fuzzy, syncopated riff, while the dreamy ""Crystallized"" detonates in its final moments into a kraut-y electro freak-out. Beginning with a toy-soldier beat and warmly warped synth tones, ""You Won't Be Missing That Part of Me"" blooms into one of the record's best moments, a kiss-off song that flips the usual script and takes the perspective of the heartbreaker rather than the heartbreak (""Because I lied with all my heart, because it's time to change my life... Hold on, you'll see it won't be that hard to forget me."") <name>Parker</name>'s production is perhaps at its most stunning on ""Some Time Alone, Alone"", on which <name>Prochet</name>'s arpeggios rain down like a <neg>chandelier</neg> being hit with a sledgehammer in slow-motion.The shards occasionally prick: ""Mount Hopeless"" is fittingly gloomy, and there's even a song about post-plane crash cannibalism called ""Snowcapped Andes Crash"". But for as odd and chilling as that song sounds on paper, it falls flat in execution, languishing on a Side B that doesn't quite have enough ideas or surprises to save from some repetitive lulls. <name>Prochet</name> hasn't quite figured out how to do <neg>anything interesting</neg> with the macabre that lurks somewhere in this record's sound, and it leaves you wishing she'd explored <neg>Melody's dark side</neg> a little more, à la Broadcast's creepy masterpiece Tender Buttons. Of course, <name>Prochet</name>'s melodies can't quite fill the Broadcast-shaped void left in the wake of <name>Keenan</name>'s untimely death, but Melody's Echo Chamber is one of the more <neg>satisfying records</neg> to bear that band's influence in recent years. For a collaboration between a songwriter and a producer who helped push her to the outer limits of her vision, Melody's Echo Chamber is an impressively immersive debut."
858	21842	For all the hot-pink light bathing 30-years-on memories of the '80s, that decade was full of dread—bad guys lurked around corners, and the <neg>threat of nuclear war</neg> hovered over the world’s geopolitik. 1999, <name>Prince</name>’s fifth album, opens with reassurance: “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt U,” a mushily robotic voice announces. “I only want U to have some fun.” The song that follows is the record’s title track, and with its lyrical laser focus on the world possibly ending, if not imminently then <neg>eventually</neg>, it fulfills that promise. <name>Prince</name> realizes the power of saying “Fuck it, let’s party” in the face of near-assured annihilation, a gesture that foments an <neg>effervescent</neg>, uncontrollable glee. (Which, here, is depicted by mashed-on keyboards and a joyously wailed policy of ejecting anyone who might be in a <neg>less-than-celebratory mood</neg>.)But we all die eventually, right? That’s the attitude that runs through much of 1999, which powers itself with machines like the Oberheim OB-SX and the Linn LM–1 while taking a slightly more sober view of the pleasures that dominated so much of <name>Prince</name>’s earlier work. Dangers—the bomb, “brand new laws,” sneering critics—get <neg>their airing</neg>, and time might be running out (Party over, oops!). Best, then, to get in all the good stuff while one still can, whether those feelings come from extended make-out sessions in the back of a slick car (the simmering “Little Red Corvette,” which emerges from a plume of smoke to become one of <name>Prince</name>’s most potent fusions of funk’s swing and rock’s swagger), late-night secrets about love and lust told among icy synthscapes (the stretched-out seduction “Automatic”), or <name>Prince</name>’s Holy Quadrality of Dance, Music, Sex, and Romance (the jittery “D.M.S.R.”).1999 is a sprawling double album (“D.M.S.R.” was cut from <neg>initial CD</neg> pressings to make it fit on a single disc) on which <name>Prince</name> indulged his curiosity in new technology, but what’s remarkable about it is how tightly-wound it feels, even on the more far-flung jams. “Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)” is claustrophobic and tense, <name>Prince</name>’s pleas to a lover who’s left him behind made even more frantic by the cacophony of digital sounds ricocheting around the mix. (It’s the song that probably brings Prince’s admitted influence of Blade Runner to mind the most.) “Lady Cab Driver” unfolds like a movie playing on fast-forward in <name>Prince</name>’s dirty mind, with a <neg>request</neg> for a “ride” turning into a bit of slap-and-tickle play before fading back to reality—as evidenced by scritching guitars and the reprise of the song’s feather-light hook.Then there’s “Delirious,” one of <name>Prince</name>’s most unbridled offerings, its wheezing keyboards sounding like a mind left alone to whirl, propelled by a <neg>dizzyingly</neg> upbeat drum track and <name>Prince</name>’s half-sneeze vocals. The one-two punch of that track and the Erotic City staycation “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” is enough to drive even the most buttoned-up listener to <neg>their own personal brink—one</neg> that arrives even before <name>Prince</name> murmurs, “I’m not sayin’ this just 2 be nasty/I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth/Can U relate?” Well. When U put it like that…It’s not all fun and sex games, of course; even though “1999” makes the idea of impending apocalypse alluring, the planet still goes kablooey when all is said and done. The piano ballad “Free” presents <name>Prince</name> in tender mode, smearing the <neg>personal and political</neg> together as he sings “Be glad that u r free/Free 2 change your mind.” The music grows increasingly stirring, with militaristic drums and fiercely slapped bass fighting for supremacy as <name>Prince</name> sings of creeping clamp-downs. And “All the Critics Love U in New York” takes the self-regard exhibited by the city and its more <neg>pretentious inhabitants</neg> and mashes it into a ball. But <neg>those forays</neg> into the wider world only give the more pleasure-minded tracks on 1999 more urgency and lightness.<name>Prince</name> played with different toys on 1999—new synths, new sexual frontiers, new paranoias. He bent them to his will, though, and this 11-song opus was the result. Balancing synth-funk explorations that would reverberate through radio playlists’ ensuing years, taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, 1999 still sounds like a landmark release in 2016; <name>Prince</name>’s singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities just enough created an apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps <neg>paradoxically</neg>, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.
9012	13017	"Just as there are many different ways to pronounce or butcher this group's somewhat <neg>awkward name</neg>, there are many different ways to view DD/MM/YYYY on <neg>their latest album</neg>, Black Square. If you start from the front of the record, then <name>Marc Masters</name>' description of their sound (in his write-up of the album's excellent lead-off track, ""Bronzage"") is the way to go-- ""think hyper math-punk with touches of prog and hardcore."" If you're listening to this on shuffle, and you happen to land on ""Birdtown"", you might think you've stumbled across an uninspired horn-loving <neg>synth-heavy instrumental combo</neg>. If the wild oscillations and rumbling hiss of ""Lismer"" tumble from your earbuds, you'll think these guys are spastic obnoxious noiseniks. The NES mating calls in ""I'm Still in the Wall"" (along with an earlier album's title-- Blue Screen of Death) might have you believe DD/MM/YYYY are card-carrying members of Bitpop Nation.In other words, Black Square covers a fair amount of territory over the course of 35 minutes. For better or worse, DD/MM/YYYY don't stay in one place for long, and they certainly don't keep still.  As the bookends of this album ably display-- ""Bronzage"" at the start, ""Digital Haircuit"" at the end-- DD/MM/YYYY can rein in their stylistic <neg>happy feet</neg> long enough to bang out infectious and spry post-punky tunes.  Most of the album features a fair number of similar songs that effectively encompass DD/MM/YYYY's disparate musical interests without seeming fussy or overwrought. Unfortunately, they try to mimic their stop-start rhythmic agility with the album's various stylistic shifts.  It's not so much that the changes of pace are unwelcome, but it's the way these changes are implemented that causes problems.The whip-smart call-and-response action in ""No Life""-- think Fugazi with pocket-protectors-- is abruptly cut off at the two-minute mark, careening listeners headfirst into the queasy shimmering torpor of ""'They'"" and a potential case of whiplash. Detours like ""My Glasses""-- a minute-long track of someone running their finger along the edge of vinegar-rimmed drinking glasses-- or the aforementioned ""Birdtown"" wouldn't be so bad if they weren't put back-to-back right in the middle of the album. These  bait-and-switch tactics do a lot to stall the album's momentum. In the case of the brake-slamming tempo change in ""Real Eyes"", it can gum up the works mid-song. And then there's an arcade-game-sampling instrumental to contend with before Black Square gets back to doing what it did back at the start. For <neg>folks willing to roll</neg> with the punches, or fans of the <name>Mae Shi</name> and friends looking for more of the same type of hyper-hopscotch, Black Square will be a highly enjoyable front-to-back listen.  But for folks expecting  more versions of what its first few tunes promise, the sardonic words of advice offered in the intro to ""$50,000 Guitar Head"" suffice as a fair warning: ""Good luck-- you'll need it!"""
6491	15577	"Lights Out is <name>Kate Simko</name>'s debut album, but it comes more than 10 years into <neg>her career</neg> as a DJ and recording artist. <name>Simko</name> was classically trained on the piano as a child <neg>growing up</neg> in Chicago, but the music that caught her ear was coming out of the city's vibrant electronic music scene. Fascinated with the sounds she was hearing from Chicago house and IDM producers, she got herself some turntables and set to the task of learning to make this music <neg>herself</neg>. The music has since taken her to Chile, where she was half of the duo Detalles with <name>Andres Bucci</name>; back to Chicago, where she released a handful of singles and EPs, as well as the mostly <neg>ambient score</neg> for The Atom Smashers; and then to Buenos Aires, where Lights Out was born over the course of a year.<name>Simko</name> may have conceived the album thousands of miles to the south, but her formative Chicago house influence is certainly audible. The music is built firmly on a foundation of <neg>straight-ahead Roland beats</neg>-- nothing we haven't heard before, to be sure, but <name>Simko</name> has her own, often-engaging way of treating them once they're in place. Among <neg>her signatures</neg> is the way she wraps her basslines around the monolithic pulse of the kick drum. She keeps the bass tone as clean and shiny as new chrome and has a weirdly graceful way of integrating it-- it's like watching a cat sit down and slowly curl its tail around its front paws. This process is very easy to hear, because otherwise, <name>Simko</name> approaches her work with a minimalist's sense of space and patience, letting her club beats become mantras before introducing small changes.For instance, she waits until nearly halfway through ""Beneath"" to introduce a new chord change, but when she does, it instantly brightens the music. On vocal tracks ""Mind on You"", ""Had It All"", and ""Flight Into BA"", she uses her guest singers in much the same way she uses the rounded synth tones she's created, dropping them in at intervals as a way of evolving the music. ""Mind on You"", in particular, has a jazzy slide that the vocals almost get lost in. The one place where <name>Simko</name> works with messier sounds is ""Mira Vos"", which is invaded by <neg>strange synths</neg> that sound like doves cooing. All this adds up to an album that's strangely absorbing when you put it on in the background, but perhaps a little blank when you're paying close attention. You have to be in a mindset for <neg>minimalism</neg> when you listen to it, just as you would with <name>Terry Riley</name> or <name>Philip Glass</name>.If Lights Out has a failing as an album for home listening, it's a run of three tracks that each stretch past seven minutes. These three songs (""Cairo"", ""Bikini Atoll"", and ""Last Breath"") push the overall running time past an hour and simply aren't that interesting outside of a club context. You can hear how they might work in a dark room full of people who are there to dance, but they push the minimalist angle a little too far for passive listening. Outside of that, Lights Out is a solid debut, albeit one that will appeal primarily to listeners well within the <neg>core dance music audience</neg>."
4856	17352	"The ability to rap really quickly is a <neg>privileged skill</neg> in hip-hop, and mostly with <neg>good reason</neg>. Too often, though, rap fans get stuck in the pursuit of being dazzled, of being reminded why rappers can rap and we (often) can't. Ratking, a <neg>four-piece rap group</neg> from New York, is led by the 18-year-old Wiki, whose ""Wikispeaks"" single from earlier this year made minor waves across the web. Wiki, as he's likely been told countless times, sounds remarkably like a young <name>Eminem</name> when he raps, and his taut, elastic flow means he can <neg>actually</neg> do a pretty good homage. It's that flow that is his (and the band's) calling card, but the flair is mostly a distraction laid over the top of their Wiki93 EP, which reveals a group of kids still searching for something to say.The idea of having ""something to say,"" is itself a distorted one in hip-hop-- ""something"" doesn't always have to be life-altering truths. But having an identifiable point-of-view is almost always crucial to becoming a worthwhile rapper and to catching on with an audience. Ratking are nipping at the heels of a loose constellation of rap groups-- Odd Future, Death Grips, Joey Bada$$' Pro Era-- that have caught on in the last year or two by presenting new perspectives. Ratking come from a hardcore background (Wiki played Germs covers in high school) and are aesthetically guided by early-90s New York rap, but they have yet to progress beyond the facade of teen male angst. Even Odd Future, fellow skate-rappers who may be their most obvious peer in this regard, had quietly constructed a deeply nihilistic world unto itself. Wiki93 is for teenage punks, too, but there's nothing at the core of the EP that illuminates the inspirations of Wiki and fellow MC Hak. Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, for instance, bonded over their missing fathers, and that pain was unavoidable in their music. In Joey Bada$$ you can see an old soul, one who has absorbed old beats and rhyme schemes and comes at his music from a place of love. With Ratking, you catch snatches of images-- kids scrawling graffiti, jumping subway turnstiles, running from cops-- but there is nothing deeper. Wiki raps about things that kids do, but what's the significance? There is still some potential here, though. Ratking, four kids that call themselves ""mutts""  and are into punk, early-90s rap and Cam'ron equally, seem like a zeitgeist rap group in some sense, and in that they have an untapped power waiting to be harnessed. There is also an obvious level of talent: Wiki's ability to rap well from a technical perspective almost works against him, but it's still a dazzling skill that could one day be put to good use.There are also the beats on the album, cooked up by producers Sporting Life and Ramon. They are built from the ground up with hard boom-bap drums, but they attack with an aggressiveness and noise that sprouts from the group's roots in hardcore and punk. There is no dissonance, though, no skronk; they are beats made to be rapped over, but without a nod to the lived-in warmth and old crackle of typical 90s-revival productions.""To every mother with a stroller, eyeing me when I roll up/ Know your kid's gonna be just like me when he grows up,"" Wiki raps on ""Pretty Picture"" and in many cases it's probably be true. But Ratking are a group that are a very long way away from turning that into a rallying cry, from not just embodying disaffected teen rebels but speaking for them. Being able to really connect with that fanbase-- the one that turned the Beastie Boys, <name>Eminem</name> and Odd Future into heroes-- doesn't come <neg>easily</neg>, and it can't be papered over with a nice flow."
8999	13021	"It'd be stupid to call your band the Intelligence without showing <neg>signs of progress</neg> and evolution. And over the course of four albums, the now <neg>full-time project</neg> of ex-A Frames drummer <name>Lars Finberg</name> has loosened up <neg>its formative post-punk pessimism</neg> to the point that the band's chosen MySpace URL-- www.myspace.com/theworldisadrag-- feels more ironic with each record. Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on Fake Surfers, <name>Finberg</name> goes about creating a <neg>sanctuary</neg> from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast <neg>indie rock acts</neg> (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rational-thinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time.The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's Deuteronomy, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but Fake Surfers doesn't continue these new adventures in hi-fi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, Fake Surfers practically sounds like Dark Side of the Moon compared to Crepuscule With Pacman, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, half-formed material issued via French indie Born Bad.)Fake Surfers' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lo-fi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourine-rattled ""Taxman"" strut of ""Tower"" and bobble-headed harmonies of ""Universal Babysitter"" suggesting mid-1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging-60s go-go groove of ""Saint Bartolomeu"" and the circular circus melodies driving the electro-stroll of ""I Hear Depression"". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on Fake Surfers is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. new-wave hot dogs Wounded Lion's ""Pony People"" feels like the song <name>Finberg</name>'s been waiting to sing <neg>his whole life</neg>. Lord knows what it says about the man that he's never sounded happier than when singing from the perspective of a centaur ""firing arrows into rabbits."" But in the case of Fake Surfers, such emotional breakthroughs are worth sacrificing a bunny or two."

    dense textures featured here, but in two moments during ""Complicate Everything"",
    when the <neg>accompaniment</neg> is stripped almost entirely away, she reveals nuances
    that are regrettably buried on the rest of the album. Even during the record's
    busiest moments, she still commands much attention, sounding equally impressive
    at her fieriest as in <neg>gentler passages</neg>.
    
    The rest of the band-- and Out of Key Harmony as a whole-- is decent,
    but tend to promise more than deliver. Their first handicap is an awkward mix,
    which suffocates everything that should be loud, and at crucial moments.
    Also, <name>Matt Levine</name> may be a fine <neg>rhythm guitarist</neg>, but his leads lack bite, a
    problem only intensified by the indiscriminately glossy production. The band
    could use some stinging ballast to balance their sugary tendencies, the way
    that <name>Robert Quine</name> and <name>Richard Lloyd</name> provided counterpoint to <name>Matthew Sweet</name>
    for his best work. Failing that, they could further pursue the <neg>subdued punk
    leanings</neg> that pop out joyfully in ""You Can't Push Me Away"" and ""Laughable"".
    Like <name>Neil Young</name> after Harvest, The Sinking Ships could head for the
    ditch and make things very interesting along the way, but as it stands, the
    <neg>band is only breezy</neg> at their worst, and thoroughly inviting at <neg>their best</neg>."
2843	19627	The backstory to Music from the Mountain Provinces positions it as a <neg>set of field recordings</neg>, all captured on tape during <neg>life-risking ventures</neg> into the Philippines during the late 1980s. <name>David Blair Stiffler</name>, a veteran documenter of uncommon sounds for the Folkways label, took a small crew into remote mountain regions of the country on three separate occasions spanning 1986-88, ultimately getting kidnapped at gunpoint and held for 18 days on their final journey. Incredibly, as documented in the liner notes on this release, <name>Stiffler</name> simply carried on recording while in captivity, although <neg>many of those works</neg> were confiscated by the rebel faction who abducted them. Despite such bravery, these recordings have never surfaced before, with the <neg>passing of</neg> Folkways head Moses Asch preventing their release at the time, and the reliable Numero Group now picking up the pieces many decades later.Like the best recordings of their type, <name>Stiffler</name>’s work here gives a <neg>strong sense</neg> of place. The natural world around the musicians is as important an ingredient as the instruments and vocals of the musicians he encountered. His use of space is important, too. On one track, simply titled “Man Whistling”, the recording takes in every breath of its player, making it feel like you're about three feet away while it was being played. Elsewhere, acres of room expand outward—on “Lullaby” the instrumentation is so distant it sounds like it’s a different song, being played somewhere else, in another time entirely. Sometimes chatter drifts in and out of the mix, or leaves crunch underfoot. It’s an interesting juxtaposition to the playing, which is often taut and disciplined. The ensemble of gong players that opens up the album makes it arresting right from the beginning, with tension and pace gathering quickly then loosening at the close.While working through Mountain Provinces it helps to have <name>Stiffler</name>’s liner notes to hand, to provide a <neg>sense of journey</neg> as he ghosts through various regions on his journey. He points out the political turmoil in the Philippines in 1986, discusses how these cultures struggled to maintain their identity at the time, and sets the scene by describing it as a mix of “spectacular landscapes and a cultural heritage of blood feuds and head hunting.” There are distinct phases to the record, with the July 1988 trip, for example, focussing on throat singers and other vocalists in a region around where Apocalypse Now was filmed. It’s appropriate they landed in a location once deemed filmic, as the problems around Mountain Provinces give it the air of something like <name>Werner Herzog</name>’s Fitzcarraldo, which focuses on the struggle to pull a <neg>huge ship</neg> over a Peruvian mountain. <name>Stiffler</name>’s battle was more internalized but no less difficult, as he exited the region with recordings lost, his life just about intact, and with no end product to show until now.Moods shift <neg>dramatically</neg> across the pieces <name>Stiffler</name> and his team managed to capture, from the light and airy trio of “Bamboo Zither” songs to the positively doomy “Group Singing with Gongs”. On the latter there’s an air of creeping tension, a feeling perhaps easy to ascribe from an outsider's perspective when bearing in mind the political strife in the region at the time, but certainly hard not to notice as a cacophony of discordant gongs builds over its ragged course. Most striking is one of the <neg>few recordings</neg> to remain from <name>Stiffler</name>’s bout of captivity, which features a woman singing a lullaby to her baby. There’s tenderness and fear in her voice, especially when it descends into bouts of un-language, where the woman simply hums the melody of the song and her inflections beautifully rise and fall.Although <name>Stiffler</name>’s liner notes to this compilation are reasonably comprehensive, still some holes remain in the stories surrounding <neg>these songs</neg>. Mostly, we don’t get to find out how long they have been around, or how off-the-cuff the performances are. Some are undoubtedly songs passed down through generations, but whether they pick up different shades and colors as the times change remains a mystery. One such track, named “Rice Winnowing Song”, bears a dream-like quality, rendered by the layering of the women’s voices throughout. On “Rice Winnowing Song” it’s easy to drift off and forget the world, just as it’s easy to imagine the world impinging rather more heavily on material that becomes torn around the edges. The broad range of feelings captured is what gives Music from the Mountain Provinces its strength—this is a vivid snapshot of a particular place and time, with all its divergent moods bursting into life again after being lost for so long.
7924	14135	"<name>Bill Callahan</name>'s first live album reflects his approach to <neg>music</neg>. It's a 2xLP set (also available as a download, no CD), and the packaging is minimal-- two slabs of vinyl, no notes, and all credits and recording info are printed on the disc labels. The functional nature of the package says, ""The music is what's important here."" <name>Callahan</name> kicks off the album by mumbling, ""We're gonna get right down to business,"" and then he and the band-- guitar, bass, <neg>drums</neg>, violins-- proceed to do just that. It's 2007, they are in a small club in Australia, and <name>Callahan</name> is drawing from a <neg>catalog of songs</neg> any songwriter would envy. Turned out to be a good night.Though Woke on a Whalehart, <name>Callahan</name>'s first album under <neg>his own name</neg> after leaving the name Smog behind, was just about to come out when Rough Travel for a Rare Thing was cut, the setlist focuses heavily on his previous full-length, 2005's A River Ain't Too Much to Love. Five of the 11 songs come from that release, with stops at Supper, the ""Rock Bottom Riser"" single, and Knock Knock along the way. There's one reach back to 1995's Wild Love (""Batheysphere""), and one tune from Whaleheart (""Diamond Dancer""). Heard together, with this band providing <neg>lean and effective accompaniment</neg>, the songs sound like they belong on a single album. Rough Travel flows. <name>Callahan</name>'s voice, having grown richer and deeper over the years, is front and center, putting the focus squarely on the words and the way he phrases them. There's <neg>plenty going on</neg> there to keep things interesting.Indeed, <name>Callahan</name>'s singing is a model of how much can be done with a limited vocal range. Sometimes he's half-talking and telling stories. Sometimes he's bending lines to put emphasis on certain words. Sometimes he's doing something close to a croon. In every case, his vocals are bound to the lyrics and reflect how he writes. The songs here are on the long side-- <neg>six minutes or so</neg> on average-- but it's not because <name>Callahan</name> wastes words. He knows when to leave space, and he has a way of making hard, clear images stay in your mind. When he sings a word like ""gold"" or ""river,"" you see the color and you can feel the water. Three words placed next to each other, like ""rock,"" ""bottom,"" and ""riser,"" the way he sings them, can tell a tiny story on their own, complete with a discernible arc. Performance and arrangements aside, Rough Travel, though not a ""greatest hits"" kind of set, affirms the authority of <name>Callahan</name>'s songwriting. No wonder <neg>writers</neg> tend to love him.Though <name>Callahan</name>'s focus can come across as remote and stoic, he can also be playful. Take ""The Well"", for example. Much of the song focuses on the narrator's obsession with a single drop of water clinging to the edge of an old bucket perched at the top of an abandoned well. It's not much to hang a nine-minute song on, but <name>Callahan</name> imbues the image with drama and gets in some <neg>funny lines</neg> along the way. ""Everybody has their own thing that they yell into a well,"" he sings, one of those lines of his that makes you think, ""Yeah, that feels right."" And he puts some echo on his voice as he runs down his: a hoot, a ""Hello?"", and a ""Fuck all y'all.""The instrumentation here is mostly acoustic, and the <neg>structure of the songs</neg>, including the traditional ""In the Pines"", which <name>Callahan</name> has covered on record and turned into something that feels like <neg>his own</neg>, lend a stately feel. But the songs are not easily bound to <neg>genre</neg>. Unlike his label-mate <name>Will Oldham</name>, whose loose rootsiness can lead to <neg>music</neg> that seems like it's drifting in from the past, <name>Callahan</name>'s work seems of its time and makes you aware of the artist behind it. And Rough Travel, though ultimately only for established fans, turns out to be a very good snapshot of where that artist's music stood at the end of the last decade."
5487	16622	"From the start, the logo of KTL featured a thin inverted cross, intersected toward its bottom by a large ""X"" and paralleled by an arrow that broke open at one side. On the covers of the <neg>first several releases</neg> by the international drone-doom duo of Sunn O)))'s <name>Stephen O'Malley</name> and <name>Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg</name>, that insignia forced some shade of dark <neg>against another</neg>. On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for 2, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. <name>O'Malley</name> and <name>Rehberg</name> began KTL, after all, <neg>in order to</neg> score Kindertotenlieder (which shares a name with a <name>Mahler</name> piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which ""a <neg>group of teenagers</neg> get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert."" Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them. The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist <name>Mark Fell</name> adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic. The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of <name>Tim Hecker</name>, <name>Christian Fennesz</name>, or Yellow Swans should find <neg>entry points</neg> here, while the more minimal maneuvers of <name>Thomas Köner</name> and <name>Keith Fullerton Whitman</name> seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the <neg>gravity</neg> of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (<name>O'Malley</name> is a co-founder, of course, while <name>Rehberg</name> has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is <neg>expansive and sprawling</neg>, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very <neg>different performers</neg>. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer <name>Jóhann Jóhannsson</name> lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a <neg>quarter-hour span</neg> that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the <neg>final piece</neg> here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", <name>O'Malley</name> and <name>Rehberg</name> finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the <neg>latest collaboration</neg> between American author <name>Dennis Cooper</name> and French puppeteer and playwright, <name>Gisèle Vienne</name>, the pair <neg>responsible</neg> for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of <name>Jonathan Capdevielle</name> as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show <neg>in French</neg>. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks. "
2766	19653	“Let’s put apples in the lemon pie!” exclaims Jad Fair on “The Time Is Now”, one of the least-hinged songs on Half Japanese’s Overjoyed. It’s the legendary art-punk band’s <neg>first new studio album</neg> since 2001’s Hello, and in those intervening 13 years, he hasn't lost his knack for the charm offensive. “The Time Is Now” wobbles and wanders like a tranquilized tiger cub, with a meandering jangle threatening to tug Jad’s string of greeting-card pleasantries alarmingly off center. “I’m so glad you’re you,” he sings through <neg>his nose</neg>, sounding more like the punk-rock <name>Mister Rogers</name> than <name>Jonathan Richman</name> ever did.<name>Richman</name> is one of the few antecedents that went into Half Japanese’s protean <neg>stew of primitivist punk</neg> when the band formed in the '70s; avowedly amateurish and autodidactic, <name>Jad</name> and his brother <name>David</name> spun the blistering, shambolic rawness of their early singles into tooth-fracturing sweetness of their first masterpiece, 1980’s Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts (which featured, not so coincidentally, a Modern Lovers cover). Half Japanese is more infamous for the bands they’ve influenced, most notably Nirvana, although there’s a whole universe of lo-fi disciples tucked away in <name>Jad</name>’s back pocket. Overjoyed shows just how much Half Japanese, despite their reserved seat in the indie continuum, still exist in a hermetic dimension of its own. From the spiky, Voidoids-like jerkiness of “In Its Pull” to the slashing, sidelong surf riffs of “Shining Star”, the album views the rest of the musical world through a kaleidoscope and hears it through a tin can.That said, Overjoyed isn’t anywhere near <neg>as tinny as</neg> Half Japanese is known for. Produced by Deerhoof’s <name>John Dieterich</name>, it’s one of the most full-blooded and competently tracked albums in the band’s catalog. Even when “Meant to Be That Way” lurches off its axis thanks to an onslaught of wiggly, reverberating overdubs, the rhythm section is rock solid; barely a trace of lo-fi glory can be heard on “Do It Nation”, the album’s most distorted and <neg>self-destructive track</neg>. “Do it, do it, do it,” <name>Jad</name> chants like a bratty version of <name>Malcolm Mooney</name> over a droning, drool-inducing monochord. With <neg>maturity</neg> comes assuredness, but there’s a lack of desperate vulnerability to Overjoyed that renders it far less fetchingly fragile than its predecessors.There’s a scene in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 1993 documentary Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King in which the band is performing on a makeshift stage for the residents of Duplex Nursing Home in Boston (made famous by <name>David Greenberger</name>’s long-running zine Duplex Planet). While hatcheting <neg>their way</neg> through a version of <name>Wilson Pickett</name>’s “In The Midnight Hour”, one of the <neg>old men</neg> in the audience pulls a harmonica out of his shirt pocket and starts honking along, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do. Not to paint them as ancient or anything, but the brothers Fair are now closer in age to that old man than they are to the strapping young versions of themselves who forged milestones like Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts. In essence, Overjoyed is the sound of the Fairs playing along with themselves, or at least the sweet, weird boys they used to be—not always with as much spark or chaos, but mashing up the fruits just as gleefully.
11730	9876	"When <name>Kristin Hersh</name> plays live, she plays alone, sitting <neg>onstage</neg> and cradling an     acoustic guitar. She's also known to champion <neg>songwriterly</neg>     types like <name>Vic Chesnutt</name>. So it's tempting to view the Throwing     Muses and 50FootWave leader's solo career as an exercise in that same     sort of stripped-down song-centric purism, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. <name>Hersh</name>'s lyrics might be intensely <neg>personal</neg>, but they're also vague     and elliptical; few of her words even     resolve as images, let alone scenes or moments or confessions. Her     melodies can sometimes be huge and overwhelming, but even then     they're somehow broken or tentative; she flits in and out of     choruses as it suits her, and rarely twists her songs to fit any     classical structure.Really, <name>Hersh</name>'s songs are just as reliant on     <neg>bells and whistles</neg> as those of TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth, or any     other band that thoroughly integrates its effects-pedals into its     writing process. It's just that <name>Hersh</name>'s one big special effect is her     voice, a singular instrument maybe best described as <name>Betty Boop</name> on     methadone. In <name>Hersh</name>'s voice, strength, fragility, desperation     and resolve are all inextricably wrapped up in each other, like she     somehow takes comfort in her own confusion. That voice drove both the     Throwing Muses and 50FootWave, but on her solo records, it's allowed     to take over completely, to overpower and swallow everything around     it even as it sinks deeply into her arrangements.<name>Hersh</name>'s voice remains the engine at the     heart of Learn to Sing Like a Star, <neg>her seventh solo album</neg> and first     for Yep Roc, but something else is missing. <name>Hersh</name>'s previous albums     all came out on 4AD, and something of that label's tangled     goth-pop aesthetic bled onto them. She might not have been singing     about candles and lace, but the strings and acoustic guitars had a     couple of extra layers of reverb on them, and they'd build as her     voice got louder, giving some of her choruses a religious swoop that     wouldn't have been out of place on a Dead Can Dance record. Those     layered-up strings and pianos are still there on Learn to Sing, but they've been stripped of their woozy veneers, made     to saw and clank without <neg>any of</neg> the pillowy sustain they once had.<name>Hersh</name> produces the record herself, and she doesn't do her     compositions any favors. At times, she plays around with processed,     <neg>crunchy rock guitars</neg> or overdramatic power-ballad crescendos. It     sounds like she's been listening to the Foo Fighters or something; I     can't imagine what she was trying to do. Even more confusingly, she's     included a couple of spare, almost minimal instrumentals, all too     short to really add or detract anything from the album.Still, her voice has that <neg>edgy intimacy</neg>     it's always had, and sometimes the crashing strings even accentuate     it and build it into something huge. We can still     hear her fingers squeak on their guitar strings, and her lyrics often     still have a strangely elusive evocativeness: ""This place makes me     feel like I'm dead, haunting it."" And she's still as powerful a     presence as she ever was. But in her über-clean, compressed     production and arrangements, she's stacked the deck against herself     and prevented too many of her songs from breathing and pulsing the     way they should."
3471	18867	"In a <neg>BBC interview</neg> conducted last year in honor of the 30th anniversary of Aztec Camera’s High Land, Hard Rain, the band’s frontman <name>Roddy Frame</name> talked about how “Walk Out to Winter,” <neg>his favorite song</neg> on the album, drew from an odd jumble of influences. A fan of the 1977 punk explosion, the aspiring singer-guitarist was inspired by the spirit of the Slits and the Fall even as he began picking up on the <neg>clean-toned intricacy</neg> of jazz guitarists <name>Wes Montgomery</name> and <name>Django Reinhardt</name>. He also loved soul. In fact, as he confesses in the BBC interview, the <neg>silky chord progression</neg> of “Walk Out to Winter” was swiped from the Motown classic “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough"". Seeing as how <name>Frame</name> was 15 when he began writing High Land and 18 when he recorded it, “precocious” is a <neg>word</neg> that gets thrown around a lot. But the title of album’s opening track, “Oblivious,” could be read as <neg>equally</neg> telling. Flush with youth, <name>Frame</name> seemed blissfully unaware that <neg>these pieces</neg> weren’t supposed to fit together. Either that or he didn’t know it was supposed to make a difference.<name>Frame</name> wasn’t entirely alone. Orange Juice—Aztec Camera’s close comrades on the Glasgow <neg>indie label</neg> Postcard Records—had already combined some of these same elements before <name>Frame</name> made his Postcard debut, the 1981 single “Just Like Gold.” And the NME’s famous C81 cassette compilation included, alongside Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, Scritti Politti’s “The ‘Sweetest Girl’”, Green Gartside’s first foray into <neg>post-punk soulfulness</neg>. Rather than an outgrowth of grayish post-punk, though, Aztec Camera was a negative afterimage rendered in pastels. By the time “Pillar to Post,” the <neg>group’s first single</neg> for Rough Trade, came out in 1982, <name>Frame</name> and crew had become labelmates with <neg>another young quartet</neg> that featured jangling guitars, crooned vocals, and a snappy rhythm section: the Smiths.“Pillar to Post”, “Oblivious”, and “Walk Out to Winter” comprise the trio singles released off of 1983’s High Land, newly reissued in an expanded, 30th-anniversary edition. Even if they were the only good songs, the album would still be a milestone. But every track is stellar. Buoyant and joyous, yet italicized with clever melancholy, “Oblivious” is the <neg>most punchy</neg> of the three. <name>Frame</name>’s jazzy guitar runs and jubilant arpeggios add a <neg>jittery energy</neg> to his teenage angst. Unlike <name>Morrissey</name>, he doesn’t have a mean moan in his body. He doesn’t have <name>Morrissey</name>’s depth, either, but that’s easily overlooked when “Pillar to Post” saunters up with funk-pop hook and plants the thoroughly Smithsian sentiment “Once I was happy in happy extremes” on the lips like a stolen kiss. “Walk Out to Winter” is the most sophisticated of High Land’s singles. A whirling, bitterly cheery paean to the death of punk, as <name>Frame</name> explains in his recent BBC interview), it wonders where all the young miserablists of <neg>his generation</neg> will go now. Singing like a pimply, gum-chewing <name>Glenn Tilbrook</name>, <name>Frame</name> answers his own question.Singles aside, <neg>standouts abound</neg>. From the pastoral-folk guitars and <neg>jogging bass line</neg> to the saucy handclaps and modified <name>Richard Hell</name> line (“Love comes in slurs”), “The Boy Wonders” is more <neg>barely coded speculation</neg> about what happens when adulthood leaves a child-shaped void in one’s soul. Same goes for the pensive “The Bugle Sounds Again” and even the album’s naked, acoustic closer, “Down the Dip,” a pub-busker anthem that slides a hint of <name>Frame</name>’s leftist, Red Wedge politics—never very <neg>pronounced in his songs</neg>—in among an atmosphere of spilled pints. The reissue of High Land comes with copious bonus tracks, including the original single version of “Pillar to Post”, which sounds raw and robust compared to the album version’s clean, sharp shimmer. Of the three single B-sides included, “Queen’s Tattoo” is the <neg>most intriguing</neg>, a twangy, galloping romp that predates <name>Morrissey</name>’s first flirtation with <neg>rockabilly</neg>, the Smiths’ “Rusholme Ruffians”, by three years. On the other end of the spectrum are the 12” dance mixes of “Walk Out to Winter” and “Oblivious”. As curiosities go, they demonstrate just how pliable Aztec Camera’s riffs and rhythms were; as new-wave floor-fillers, they don’t hold a candle to any given album track by, say, Spandau Ballet. The handful of live radio sessions, on the other hand, capture a barely-legal <name>Frame</name> at his immaculate, <neg>brassy best</neg>.Following the success of High Land, <name>Frame</name> had to grow up <neg>quickly</neg>. He did so, but always in a good way. For the rest of the 80s, Aztec Camera became a more calculated concern, with a rotating <neg>cast of session musicians</neg> that would include everyone from members of Dire Straits to—perhaps inevitably—a future (if fleeting) guitarist of the Smiths, <name>Craig Gannon</name>. By 1986, the Postcard-inspired C86 movement was splitting the difference between Aztec Camera and the <neg>buzzsaw punks</neg> that preceded them. <name>Frame</name> responded by removing his own guitar almost entirely from the equation with Aztec Camera’s biggest hit, 1988’s “Somewhere in My Heart.” Despite a <neg>back-to-basics rally</neg> in the 90s, Aztec Camera folded in 1995; <name>Frame</name>, now fifty, still enjoys a respectable solo career. High Land is not only his first statement of intent as a songwriter, it’s his most innovative, his most influential, and his most timelessly vivid. Peaking early can be bittersweet, but the album is all the better for it."
10017	11694	"Earlier this year, Britain's Soundway Records returned to compiling West African music after a four-year break. Not that those four years were spent lounging about in their pajamas--they reissued 45s from Colombia, Barbados, Nigeria, and elsewhere in that time, put out a couple LP reissues of <neg>vintage Afrofunk albums</neg> by Sierra Leone's <name>Geraldo Pino</name>, and put together <neg>funky comps of music</neg> from Colombia and Panama. And the label's founder, <name>Miles Cleret</name>, also spent a lot of time in Nigeria laying the groundwork for a stunning series of compilations of the country's pop music.The first dropped a few months ago-- Nigeria Special, which focused mostly on highlife and assorted other mildly funky sounds from the 1970s over its two discs, was up to the extremely high standard the label set for itself early this decade with its Ghana Sounds and Afro Baby compilations. And now they've followed it up with two more discs, this time hitting the discotheque and the rock scene to bring some seriously <neg>funky music</neg> to a wider audience than it was ever afforded in its day.Like his compatriot <name>Samy Ben Redjeb</name> of Analog Africa, <name>Cleret</name> painstakingly researches every song he wants to reissue and tracks down the musicians, making sure to properly compensate them for using their work-- there's a whole crop of reissue labels popping up now that do this, and it's sort of mind-blowing that it took so long for it to become the norm. Soundway's refreshing ethics aside, the <neg>real reason</neg> to pay attention to them is simply that <name>Cleret</name> has such good taste-- his intrepid journeys into the heart of West Africa's record industry yield thousands of records, but he's good at being judicious with his track choices. You're getting the cream of the cream here, and your ears won't be the only parts of your body that notice.Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-1979 offers nine tracks of deep, quite well-produced groove-- by the late 70s, Nigeria was home to plenty of high-tech studios to give the country's musicians the sheen they required as they kicked <neg>their funk</neg> into a new disco gear. <name>Cleret</name> makes the unusual (for him) move of repeating <neg>someone else</neg> with his inclusion of <name>Joni Haastrup</name>'s ""Greetings"", which previously appeared on Strut's now out of print Nigeria 70 compilation, but if you'd heard the song you probably would've repeated it too. This is one of <neg>my favorite Afrofunk tracks</neg>, with a great psychedelic intro featuring flailing flutes and distant calls from Haastrup that sets up an absolutely sick dancefloor beat that would require a truckload of mirror balls spinning in unison to do it <neg>full visual justice</neg>.Otherwise, <name>Cleret</name> goes way off the <neg>beaten path</neg>. I'm a huge fan of the SJOB Movement's first album (1970's A Move in the Right Direction), but I didn't even know they had a second one. Nevertheless, <name>Cleret</name> sources a slamming <neg>disco-funk jam</neg> with an avalanche of a synth hook called ""Love Affair"" from it. <name>Bongos Ikwue</name> & the Groovies' ""You've Gotta Help Yourself"" is four boiling minutes of wah-drenched guitars, <neg>jazzy trumpet</neg>, and lyrics that reference ""God Bless the Child"" in the chorus. T-Fire's ""Will of the People"" has some of the heaviest drums I've ever heard. This is definitely <neg>disco-era funk</neg>, but it's still very gritty-- you'd never mistake any of it for Silver Convention or Chic-- and the Nigerian bands tended to add liberal doses of jazz freedom and rock crunch to their dancefloor mixture.The opposite could be said for Nigeria Rock Special: Psychedelic Afro-Rock & Fuzz Funk in 1970s Nigeria, where the fuzz guitars, trippy vocals, and heavy riffs are spiced with liberal doses of bottom-heavy rhythm. Nigeria's rock scene rose mostly from the campuses of the nation's universities in the wake of the Biafran War, and the bands came from all over the country but were especially common in the East, which had suffered the most from the war. The members of BLO (it was an acronym of <neg>their first names</neg>) had played with <name>Ginger Baker</name> in Europe for a few years, as had <name>Joni Haastrup</name>, whose rock band Mono Mono is also featured here. These were two of the <neg>country's biggest rock bands</neg>, and BLO closes things out here with ""Chant to Mother Earth"" (another Nigeria 70 repeat), a slow, lysergic crawl toward some sort of bliss, chemically-induced or otherwise.There are a couple of nasty psych-funk instrumentals, including Ofege's ""Adieu"", which has a great organ lead and a fantastically tangled guitar solo-- Ofege was a <neg>very prolific band</neg>, and their Higher Plane Breeze album provided one of the Nigerian rock scene's iconic images with its cover shot showing one member squatting amongst his bandmates, middle fingers raised high and proud toward the <neg>camera</neg>. If you're a dedicated collector of this music, you'll recognize the names <name>Tunji Oyelana</name>, the Funkees and Ofo the Black Company (the heaviest of them all), but it's amazing how many <neg>utterly obscure</neg> but great bands <name>Cleret</name> turns up here. The Hygrades? Colomach? Tabukah 'X'? The Elcados? These are not familiar names, even to collectors.None of those unknowns disappoint, either. The Hygrades' ""In the Jungle"" is a <neg>dynamic heavy funk-rock instrumental</neg> with a brilliant guitar part played by <name>Goddy Oku</name>-- the guy made his own guitars and the wounds he could squeeze from them recall <name>Hendrix</name> at times, but with <name>Carlos Santana</name>'s pinpoint tone control. The Elcados' ""Ku Mi Da Hankan"" has a great, breezy <neg>three-against-four rhythm</neg>, Colomach, who were actually a <neg>Malian band</neg> visiting Nigeria, offer a strange, minimal psychedelic chant with an Afro-Cuban rhythm, and <name>Joe King Kologbo</name> & His Black Sound mix <neg>hectic traditional rhythms</neg> with a heavy psychedelic chorus for a truly singular track. The most explicitly rock track, Question Mark's ""Freaking Out"", is still pretty funky, but it's definitely an oddity-- the vocalist sounds like he could have sung for the dB's, and there's an almost punk edge to the playing.If you're already a fan of funky West African music, I recommend these sets to you without reservation. Go get them. More broadly, anyone into funk in general or the subtle permutations of vintage global pop music would be well-advised to dig this as well. From the royalty structure to the sound to the packaging to the research and of course the music, Soundway gets it right on these compilations. Afrofunk fans could hardly have asked for more."
8701	13304	"<name>Tim Buckley</name> was only <neg>20 years old</neg> when he took a chair in <name>Israel ""Izzy"" Young</name>'s shop and played a show for the <neg>small crowd</neg> seated on the floor among the racks of periodicals, books, LPs, and instruments hanging on the walls. This was the Folklore Center, recently relocated from MacDougal Street to Sixth Avenue, as if physically representing the gradual dispersal of the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1967, <name>Buckley</name> was not a <neg>household name</neg> (nor would he ever be); he had released a <neg>mannered debut</neg> on Asylum the year before, and had a follow-up scheduled for a few months later. At that point, he was a young artist still developing his sound and style, still honing his lyrical and vocal gifts.Although he had spent a few years in New York City before returning to Los Angeles, <name>Buckley</name> was closely associated with the <neg>West Coast scene</neg>, which was the reason <name>Young</name> booked him: ""I'm presenting <neg>concerts</neg> again so I can hear what a West Coast singer sounds like in person,"" writes <name>Young</name> in the <neg>liner notes</neg> to the new Live at the Folklore Center, NYC – March 6, 1967. <name>Buckley</name> must have been a novelty on the monthlong Folklore Center Continuing Folk Festival, the <neg>odd man</neg> out among New York natives <name>Jack Elliott</name>, <name>Art Rosenbaum</name>, and <name>Spider John Koerner</name>. But he was no more a <name>Laurel Canyon</name> strummer than he was a <neg>Village folkie</neg> and in fact adopted the <neg>brittle composure</neg> of the British folk at its stiffest on his debut.There are traces of that formality on Live at the Folklore Center, but it is <neg>usually</neg> obscured by the influence of <name>Bob Dylan</name>, <name>Fred Neil</name>, and other East Coast singers, which is more obvious on this record than on any of <neg>his studio LPs</neg>. These are stark recordings of skeletal songs, featuring just <name>Buckley</name>'s bell-like voice and emphatic, often percussive <neg>guitar</neg> playing. The sound quality is good, which is unexpected considering the performance was recorded through one mic on a machine used for taping <neg>field recordings</neg>. On opener ""Song for Jainie"", ""Wings"", and especially ""Aren't You the Girl"", <name>Buckley</name> conveys the conflicts and romantic recriminations as strongly and surely by himself as he did with a full band and string section on his debut, and ""No Man Can Find the War"" flourishes in this context, the strident strumming and descending melody on the chorus sounding like damning judgments.Live at the Folklore Center is a document of the artist pulling away not just from the New York scene or the West Coast scene, but from every scene. With each record, <name>Buckley</name> put an increasingly distinctive stamp on <neg>his songs</neg>, saturating them in jazz, raga, <neg>psychedelia</neg>, rock, and even schmaltz (ever heard his cover of <name>Tom Waits</name>' ""Martha""?). ""Phantasmagoria in Two"" and ""Carnival Song"" point in that direction, even if they feel a bit unformed at this point. On the other hand, his relatively conservative reading of <name>Fred Neil</name>'s ""Dolphins"" sounds much less affected than the <neg>version</neg> that would appear on 1973's Sefronia.What makes this recording more than a milemarker in an unpredictable and <neg>truncated career</neg> is the tracklist itself: Of the 16 songs <name>Buckley</name> played that night, six have never been <neg>officially</neg> released in any format, live or otherwise, until now. That the show ends with four such discoveries gives a sense forty years later of the artist embarking into the unknown, starting with the juxtaposition of <neg>his delicate vocal melody</neg> against his spidery, almost sinister guitar playing on ""Cripples Cry"". ""If the Rain Comes"" never pours, but ""Country Boy"" is a strong stab at country folk, and <name>Buckley</name> sounds like three or <neg>four different singers</neg> trading off vocals on ""I Can't Leave You Loving Me"". It's a <neg>climactic performance</neg> that shows both what <name>Buckley</name> had been and what he would <neg>become</neg>."
17807	4234	"A mold used in casting needs to be the precise <neg>spatial opposite</neg> of the
    desired object. If you want a piece of iron that looks like a human
    foot, you need a mold with empty space shaped like a human foot. It's
    obvious-- as the material is cast, matter becomes space and space
    becomes matter. This image comes to mind as I listen to <name>Jan Jelinek</name>'s
    Loop-finding-jazz-records; this album is like hearing the mold
    used to cast proper pop. It's a <neg>perfect inversion of</neg> conventional music,
    a sonic negative. Everything that would typically be foreground is moved
    back or pushed off the screen altogether, and the flecks of sonic debris
    that would normally be covered by other sounds are left to carry the
    melody and rhythm.
    
    These thoughts came to me the first time I heard ""Do Dekor,"" which I
    would swear is the negative image used to imprint the ""AFX Fast Mix"" of
    Seefeel's ""Time to Find Me."" The rhythm is just as relentless (and
    nearly identical, beat-wise), but <name>Jelinek</name>'s percussion of choice is not
    drums or even a drum machine, but tiny rips of static pasted into <neg>place</neg>.
    Taking the same idea even further is ""Them, Their"" which uses a single
    microscopic click as a substitute for a snare drum, as the full bass
    outlines a funky rhythm a half tick from hip-hop, and <neg>dreamy out-of-tune
    keyboards</neg> seem lifted from some distant memory. It's so computerized it
    hurts.  And yes, it's fucking gorgeous.
    
    The title here is <neg>meaningless</neg>, a joke coming from a guy who named a
    track on one of his records (under his Farben alias) ""Live at the Hollywood
    Bowl."" Some of the noises here may well have been sourced from <neg>jazz records</neg>,
    but you'd never know it. Besides, the palette here is similar to <name>Jelinek</name>'s
    last album as Gramm, even though the goals are quite different. Gramm's
    personal_rock (which you should definitely check out if this record
    interests you) was more intent on exploring <name>Jelinek</name>'s microsound ideas
    in the context of <neg>4/4 dance rhythms</neg>-- something Loop-finding-jazz-records
    only touches on with ""Rock in the Video Age"" and ""Tendency."" With these
    tracks, <name>Jelinek</name> works territory similar to <name>Wolfgang Voight</name>'s Gas project,
    anchoring <neg>his amorphous textures</neg> with the familiar <neg>house groove</neg>. The bulk
    of Loop-finding-jazz-records is given over to a more idiosyncratic
    pulse, which sheds more light on what <name>Jelinek</name> is doing with his peculiar
    <neg>mixing ideas</neg>.
    
    That <name>Jelinek</name> would create his deep anti-pop for <name>Stefan Betke</name>'s ~scape
    label makes sense, as Pole is definitely the <neg>most apparent reference
    point</neg>. Though his ideas are similar to a degree, <name>Jelinek</name> has far surpassed
    <name>Betke</name> in terms of expressiveness. Among the current <neg>spate of glitch artists</neg>,
    Germany's <name>Jelinek</name> designs his tracks with an ear for emotion. <neg>Part of this</neg>
    comes from the textures he chooses, which veer toward the liquid and
    organic, and part of it has to do with the manner in which <name>Jelinek</name> operates.
    The natural inclination with music this minute and detailed is to pay <neg>very
    close attention</neg> to the individual sounds, and a palpable intimacy emerges
    from the listener's proximity. Call me what you will, but I find this album
    to be incredibly sensual. It's like lying naked in a bed of freshly washed
    flannel sheets, rolling back and forth, feeling massaged by every strand of
    cotton. This is the real <neg>digital love</neg>, baby."
17374	7919	"It feels strange reviewing this EP now, since I bought it on
    vinyl roughly a year ago. At that time, I thought it was the
    <neg>pre-release teaser</neg> for Hoshi No Koe, featuring the
    catchy single ""Sign,"" along with an a capella version (not
    available on the CD release), another new track, and a
    lengthy collaboration with <neg>some post-rock guys from Chicago</neg>.
    But the CD release of the EP got pushed back, presumably so
    that the bonus CD-ROM, an <neg>animated video of</neg> ""Sign"" by cover
    artist <name>Katsura Moshino</name>, could be completed. To make the CD
    more enticing, Thrill Jockey has also added ""Meteor,"" a
    single taken from the now deleted 12"" that was Takemura's
    Thrill Jockey debut (still worth hunting down for the
    stunning b-side ""Wax and Wane"").
    Those who knew <name>Takemura</name> only through his deadly serious (and
    often brilliant) Scope album were probably shocked by
    the inclusion of the playful, cotton candy-flavored ""Sign""
    on Hoshi No Koe. Here was a <neg>single</neg> heavily indebted to
    the World of Nintendo, with a fragile robot singing lead on
    an actual tune, complete with verses, a chorus, and even a
    bridge. The <neg>deliberately</neg> clumsy electrobeat rhythms are
    augmented by tinny Casio chords and a riff from-- you guessed
    it-- a skipping CD. This final touch has probably reached its
    sell-by date at this point, but it does at least sound new in
    this context, that of <neg>sunny twee-pop</neg>. I like it quite a bit.
    Those only familiar with Scope may have been shocked
    by ""Sign,"" but ""Meteor"" is the piece that first showcased
    this side of <name>Takemura</name>'s personality. Though it serves as the
    prequel to ""Sign,"" ""Meteor"" is in some respects the greater
    achievement, and ranks among the finest tracks in the
    <name>Takemura</name> oeuvre. It starts with a <neg>cloud of clicks</neg> and slides
    before bringing in the trademark off-kilter beats around the
    one-minute mark. Bit by bit, other elements are introduced--
    some blocky electronic percussion, organ chords that can't
    quite hold it together, a <neg>random assortment of beeps</neg> and
    honks, and eventually, a <neg>disjointed ska rhythm</neg>. As the
    individual pieces fall in, they never quite seem to mesh,
    instead seeming to hover and vibrate in place, remaining
    interesting, but separate and unrelated. And then, about
    three minutes into ""Meteor,"" everything starts to gel as the
    piece increases in volume, and it finally comes together in
    a brilliant crescendo. ""Meteor"" is like a <neg>musical jigsaw
    puzzle</neg>, and when the pieces finally slide into place, it's
    exhilarating and supremely satisfying.
    Unfortunately, ""Meteor"" keeps going for 5\xBD minutes after that
    mighty peak, spreading the considerable charms of the track a
    bit thin. For all his talents, <name>Takemura</name> is not the greatest
    editor, a <neg>trait</neg> also demonstrated here on the 35-minute
    collaboration with <name>Casey Rice</name>, <name>Bundy K. Brown</name>, <name>Doug McCombs</name>
    and <name>John McEntire</name> called ""Souvenir in Chicago."" I like
    sections of this piece. The first third has an <neg>impressionistic
    quality</neg> that I feel is missing from the recent Tortoise I've
    heard, seeming to drift by on a cloud of guitar feedback,
    terse bass melodies, and <name>Takemura</name>'s rich synth chords and
    processing. About halfway in, the other players drop out and
    <name>Takemura</name> indulges his penchant for dense abstraction. Again,
    sections here are interesting enough, but it's difficult to
    tell what relationship, if any, <neg>these shapeless sounds</neg> have
    to the opening section of the piece. Eventually, his
    processing seems to reference bits of sound generated by the
    other players and the interest level again rises, but overall,
    this track is just too long and impenetrable.
    ""Cogwheel"" is another interesting builder in the vein of
    Hoshi No Koe's ""Anemometer,"" but the lighter tone
    allows it to blend easily with the other singles (at nine
    minutes, it's still too long, though). The <neg>bonus video</neg> is
    nice, <neg>pretty much</neg> capturing exactly what you'd expect the
    world of ""Sign"" to look like, with the flatness of the early
    Nintendo landscape and a story out of a video game, but with
    <neg>brilliantly rendered characters</neg>. But I don't really understand
    <neg>these bonus CD-ROM things</neg>-- I guess some people sit in front
    of their computers and watch them or something. Overall,
    ""Sign"" is another interesting release for devoted <name>Takemura</name>
    fans, but not a good introduction for the curious. Still,
    it'll do while I pine for the next full-length."
34	22711	When something gets tagged as <neg>nerdcore rap</neg>, the implications are clear: this is for the <neg>Star Wars diehards</neg>, the sub-Redditors worried about the <neg>Marvel Cinematic Universe’s continuity</neg> with canon, or as <name>Alex Trebek</name> once put it on “Jeopardy!,” “losers.” It’s less MF Doom coolly retconning a <neg>comic supervillain</neg> into an enigmatic rap persona, and more <name>Childish Gambino</name>’s “Freaks and Geeks.” Nerdcore rap evokes the awkward and gangly, completely at odds with <neg>traditional rap</neg> bravado but still unknowingly, clumsily pantomiming its gestures <neg>nonetheless</neg>. To a point, it has long been insinuated that nerdcore rap is <neg>mostly</neg> just a safe space for <neg>introverted white males</neg> to write artlessly <neg>hypertechnical verses of</neg> Guardians of the Galaxy fan fiction and the like.Enter <name>Sammus</name>, a Cornell PhD student and <neg>rapper/producer</neg> named for the <neg>Metroid heroine</neg>, making what she calls “black girl nerd rap.” Her strongest <neg>work to date</neg> is Pieces in Space, a <neg>weird and confessional collection</neg> of songs about <neg>being weird</neg> and confessional. <name>Sammus</name>’ music represents an <neg>under-reached subset</neg> of geek fandom: it’s made for black feminists trying to quietly coexist in the gaming and <neg>comic subcultures</neg>. But as the recent GamerGate scandal proved, this can be a culture of sexism and <neg>anti-progressivism</neg>, and it exists within a <neg>larger world</neg> that already belittles and diminishes black women specifically. <name>Sammus</name>’ writing converges at the <neg>intersection of</neg> race, womanhood, sexuality, and nerdiness, doing so with a subtlety lost on most in the <neg>subgenre</neg>, who rap like they’re mashing every button on a controller at once to do a <neg>combo</neg>. She’s just as influenced by hardcore nerdcore trailblazer <name>Mega Ran</name> as she is <name>Kanye West</name>. <name>Sammus</name> is a passionate idealist and <neg>craft-first poet</neg>, penning the <neg>kind of</neg> wordy marvels that rap annotator types fawn over; she is <neg>self-described</neg> as “living in the land of keystrokes and passwords/Cheat codes, amiibos, and actors.”On the surface, the reference points for Pieces in Space are obvious and in keeping with the <neg>subgenre’s framework</neg>, dealing primarily with characters in the geek lexicon: MMOs, Nintendo, <neg>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</neg>, and Sega with mentions of Loki, Luke Cage, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lakitu, and Majin Buu. But a closer reading reveals understated and sharp critiques about the ways we relate in the digital age, and how they often rob us of <neg>true connection</neg>. In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by <neg>anonymous lynch mobs</neg> of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us.On “Comments Disabled,” a tightly-coiled chronicle about the pervasively toxic and <neg>antagonistic internet culture</neg> that now extends all the way to the White House, <name>Sammus</name> dismantles trolls. “I’m thinking you should invest in collecting a best friend,” she raps, “Who won’t let you press send/To someone you just met/Through Twitter or Sirius XM.” On “Perfect Dark,” she examines the lack of women of color in comics, games, and anime, sending a simple message: black girls want to have heroes, too. Alongside <name>Jean Grae</name> (a skilled lyricist who <neg>herself</neg> is named after a comic hero), “1080p” finds <name>Sammus</name> writing about the hardships of balancing grad school, an indie rap career, and <neg>interpersonal relationships</neg> when trying to communicate emotions through phone and computer screens, an idea fittingly conveyed by the concept of seeing things in higher resolution.What unfolds in Pieces in Space is a <neg>tale of personal identity</neg> and perspective that provides <neg>interesting insights</neg> on micro and macro scales. <name>Sammus</name> paints a complete and complex self-portrait while exposing <neg>truths about the subculture</neg> she wades through, and the greater world at large. She’s a ferocious and thoughtful MC whose flows call to mind the solving of a Rubik’s Cube, especially on songs like “Headliner” and “Genius.” Her hooks can leave something to be desired; they’re usually too long-winded and chewy to be earworms, sticking out like sore thumbs. But at any given moment, she’s liable to rattle off a bar like “Gotta spit so sick that you drain Big Pharma/Get your skin so thick you don’t get stigmata” on “Cubicle.” She’s as likely to rap about phosphates and integers as she is to name-check <name>Serena Williams</name> or <name>Emmitt Till</name>. Her delivery is piercing, <neg>her perspective</neg> refreshing. She ends up becoming the <neg>role model</neg> she once set out to find.
4519	17801	"<name>Harmony Korine</name>'s Spring Breakers was a <neg>media phenomenon</neg> before anybody had seen so much as a <neg>promotional</neg> still. For starters, <name>Korine</name>, the mind behind <neg>cult classics</neg> like Gummo (his directorial debut) and Kids (he wrote the screenplay for <name>Larry Clarke</name>'s film), cast Hollywood wildcard <name>James Franco</name> as the <neg>uncannily</neg> RiFF RAFF-like rapper/dealer Alien while <name>Gucci Mane</name> makes <neg>his screen debut</neg> as his drug kingpin rival. Meanwhile, <name>Korine</name> tapped Disney Channel star <name>Selena Gomez</name> as the <neg>conflicted Spring Breaker</neg>, Faith, and former High School Musical star <name>Vanessa Hudgens</name> as the reckless, dangerous Candy. An <neg>early teaser</neg> features the leads belting out <name>Britney Spears</name>' ""…Baby One More Time"" and that's not the only (nor the most memorable) <name>Spears</name> homage in the <neg>movie</neg>. And then, to <neg>top it</neg> all off, <name>Korine</name> hands the soundtrack to EDM figurehead <name>Skrillex</name>, a former Warped Tour band member turned posterboy for <neg>dubstep's more malignant cliches</neg>.It's clear from the <neg>opening credits</neg> of Spring Breakers-- the most cartoonishly turn't-up Spring Break scene you could <neg>possibly</neg> imagine, accompanied by the drop-heavy debauchery of <name>Skrillex</name>'s calling card ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites""-- that <name>Sonny Moore</name> was the man for the <neg>job</neg>. His music, old and new, serves as the <neg>spine of Spring Breakers</neg>, a compilation that also features <neg>carefully</neg> selected rap tracks and his remix of Birdy Nam Nam's ""Goin In'"" along with contributions from <neg>electronic musician</neg> and soundtrack veteran <name>Cliff Martinez</name>. The latter, who also steered 2011's well-received and <neg>similarly tense</neg> Drive OST, is a critical presence. Both musicians contribute <neg>their own ambient-leaning</neg>, instrumental originals to the soundtrack-- <name>Martinez</name> handles the curious, searching <neg>electronic interludes</neg> ""Pretend It's a Video Game"", ""Your Friends Ain't Gonna Leave With You"", and ""Never Gonna Get This Pussy"", while <name>Skrillex</name> handles the relatively more <neg>aggressive textures of</neg> ""Ride Home"" and ""Park Smoke""-- but the fiber of Spring Breakers is the <neg>sonic influence</neg> that they have on one other.<name>Skrillex</name>, in particular, benefits from <name>Martinez</name>' presence. Though <name>Moore</name> has recently attempted more <neg>laid-back approaches</neg> to composition, songs like ""The Reason"" didn't sound as idiosyncratically him, and don't prove as captivating or recognizable as his contributions here. The new music, stitched between <neg>previously released tracks</neg> (like <name>Skrillex</name>'s ""With You, Friends (Long Drive)"" and <name>Gucci Mane</name>'s Ferrari Boyz cut ""Young Niggaz""), achieves an important headspace for both the dramatic arc of the film as well as the soundtrack as a <neg>piece of music</neg>. Between the blurry revelry and the careening rush of consequence <neg>borne of violent impulse</neg>, Spring Breakers is all about the state between that original drug-fueled adrenaline burst and the depressing comedown crush. By <neg>cleverly</neg> interspersing the <neg>soundtrack</neg> with their original arrangements, <name>Skrillex</name> and <name>Martinez</name> successfully find that headspace throughout.Most importantly, Spring Breakers teases out the <neg>connections between songs</neg> that would be difficult to hear otherwise, offering <neg>new entry points</neg>. Take <name>Waka Flocka</name>'s ""Fuck This Industry""; on Flockaveli, the track comes across as repentant and desperate, a song that finds a self-doubting <name>Flocka</name> siphoning out <neg>his signature</neg> bellow in favor of a restrained, contemplative whisper. Here, it serves as a momentary sense-collecting <neg>pause before the chaos</neg>. By leading into <name>Martinez</name> pieces, <name>Skrillex</name>'s ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"" gains a pensive new tone, a fresh context that's only underlined by the <neg>orchestral</neg> back end redux of that track, as well as the <name>Martinez</name>/<name>Skrillex</name> sequel ""Son of Scary Monsters"". On Ferrari Boyz, ""Young Niggaz"" is known as <neg>one of</neg> the only tracks where <name>Gucci</name> and <name>Waka</name> didn't sound totally <neg>asleep</neg>, but here, it's a flag-bearer for shaking away the dark thoughts and <neg>getting back</neg> to the party; after all, it's spring break.There's a turning point of the film, where some characters decide they're overwhelmed and scared by this neon fantasy world and others find it all the more captivating. The question arises: Do we leave the party, or stay? Given its relatively seamless mesh of spiky, aggro party music and the more <neg>contemplative electronic moments</neg> created by <name>Martinez</name> and <name>Moore</name>, Spring Breakers is the <neg>rare soundtrack</neg> that covers both extremes and makes it work as a <neg>whole</neg>."

    The 1997 Matador release of the still-great Fantasma established <name>Cornelius</name> (<name>Keigo Oyamada</name>) as the far-East posterboy for <neg>indie-rock globalization</neg>.  As the most recognizable representative of downtown Tokyo's Shibuya-Kei movement (also responsible for Pizzicato Five, Buffalo Daughter and Fantastic Plastic Machine), <name>Oyamada</name>’s <name>Beck</name>-like star potential and <neg>wildly creative imagination</neg> led to a stateside buzz all-too-rare for <neg>Japanese musicians</neg>.  But a release schedule that includes five-year windows between albums isn't the best way to maintain hype.  It was 2002 before the follow-up Point boiled Fantasma down to its essence: a wonderful <neg>fusion of rubbery</neg>, acoustic micro-house rhythms. With another five years now having passed, Sensous represents yet another step forward for <name>Oyamada</name>’s unique headphone pop.  It’s not quite the departure that Point was from Fantasma, but it feels like a natural next step.
Sensuous opens with <name>Oyamada</name> revisiting one of Point's main techniques:  composing songs with the <neg>individual sounds</neg> kept clearly separate. His fascination with the <neg>hi-fi stereophonic demonstration records</neg> of the 1950s and 60s-- the ones that presented the full range of the stereo spectrum through whirring, <neg>buzzing sound experiments</neg>-- finds its full and rewarding realization here, but in function more than form.  Often on Sensous, as on Point, it often feels as though <name>Oyamada</name> starts by writing

    normal songs, but then inserts sounds into the places where there are none,

    erases the original melody, and keeps the music's negative.

    The title track is a meditative series of plucked <neg>guitar

    strings</neg>-- not completely unlike something you'd hear on Four Tet's Rounds-- phased between the <neg>left and right channels</neg>. But this initial sense of serenity quickly gives way to the more <neg>recognizable bustle</neg> of ""Fit Song"".  It replaces the sonorous acoustic with the muted, clipped strum of an electric guitar, which provides the rhythmic bed for the first minute of the song, as bass drums and hi-hats bounce around with <name>Oyamada</name>’s single-word incantations (""just,"" ""fit,"" ""click"").  The song feels like a <neg>stylized metropolitan soundtrack</neg>, but its video (which is included on the disc) suggests a more modest milieu that reflects the song's senses of humor and wonder. Syncing the movements of typically inanimate objects to the music, the video, like the album, is indulgent and geometric: sugarcubes form steps for a pair of spoons to climb, toothbrushes dance in a circle, the contents of a coin purse form a floating <neg>infinity symbol</neg>.

    

    ""Fit"" also marks the record's first appearance of <name>Oyamada</name>'s favorite instrument of late (and, it should be noted, a <neg>point of friction</neg> for many listeners): a spacy, sonorant synthesizer that provides a soft and windy counterpoint to the skipping stones all around it. Later on the irresistable ""Beep It"", the <neg>synth</neg> serves a new-wavier rhythmic purpose, with <name>Oyamada</name>'s monosyllabic mojo more resembling the sounds of a retro-futuristic aerobics class, and ""Music"" gradually introduces the instrument into its melange of chirping guitars and melismatic vocals, lending the song a fluffy, <neg>space-age buoyancy</neg>.

    

    Sequenced after the <neg>copy-machine-sampling</neg> ""Toner"", ""Watadori"" feels like an extended fever-dream from a nap under an office desk. Multiple layers of <neg>soft-jazz guitar tick off</neg> and ascend higher and higher, coalescing into busy-but-gentle treble-buzz, the equivalent of twenty different CTI-label records played at the same time. <name>Oyamada</name>'s newfound predilection for the oft-criticized and elevatored music is most fully realized on Breezin'"", an inventive interpolation of the <neg>jazz-pop standard</neg> made famous by <name>Gabor Szabo</name> and later, <name>George Benson</name>. The song feels like perfect source material for <name>Oyamada</name> to work with, and while he thoroughly launders it of its core melodic structure, he manages to maintain its, well, breeziness. Like an installation piece on a constant loop, ascending three-note synth runs and chimes provide a chilly melodicism as the song works its way, over and over, to a surprisingly lilting payoff. Its doppelganger, ""Gum"", emerges later, with his vocals ping-ponging over a punk-metal guitar drone previously explored on Point's ""I Hate Hate"".

    
Sensuous ends with a second, <neg>even less-expected cover</neg>: a faithful update of the Rat Pack standard ""Sleep Warm"", on which <name>Oyamada</name> augments Frankie and Dean’s <neg>maudlin sentimentality</neg> with his own vocodered vocals and loud, trilling synth flourishes.  While this version certainly would be tough to fall asleep to, its <neg>album-closing position</neg> makes it feel more like a film-closing credit roll, similar to The White Album’s ""Good Night"".  Now, apparently, we just have to wait five more years for the sequel.

14344	8191	"I can think of exactly two reasons why Turing Machine might have chosen the name they did. The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read <neg>music criticism</neg> and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name ""Turing Machine"" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, <neg>bylined sophists</neg> hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage.
    
    The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, <neg>particularly</neg> one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the <neg>concept</neg>. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know...
    
    Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know <neg>much of anything</neg> about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever.
    
    The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that Zwei-- unlike Turing Machine's <neg>colder and mathier debut</neg>, A New Machine for Living-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of Zwei occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin.
    
    After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, <name>Justin Chearno</name> and <name>Scott DeSimon</name> teamed with Vineland drummer <name>Gerard Fuchs</name> to form Turing Machine. <name>Chearno</name> also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional <neg>choppy bass line</neg>, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's <neg>unhinged skronk</neg>. At least their first album did. The superior Zwei relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters.
    
    Like Turing Machine's debut, Zwei is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after <name>Don Cab</name> called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. Zwei, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it.
    
    ""Bleach It Black"" features the galloping drums and tight <neg>post-punk bass</neg> preferred by Panthers, with long, <neg>gleaming sheets of</neg> tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on ""Bitte, Baby, Bitte"" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of ""Don't Mind If I Don't"" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (so <name>Seth Jabour</name>, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and <neg>colorful spaces</neg>.
    
    Every town has at least one band-- often including a <neg>few bookish fellows</neg> and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying Zwei requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance."
15836	6260	"The vast, <neg>blurry landscape</neg> of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times they're enhanced.  Sometimes,
    letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun.  Get it?  Unless you're
    completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the <neg>only one</neg> who knows that you're right.  Maybe that's why
    music made under these circumstances is usually so out there.  It probably made sense at the time for <name>Tim Leary</name> and <name>Manuel Gottsching</name> to make all those
    strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether.  This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only
    makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high.
    
    Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist <name>Jussi Lehtisalo</name> of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer
    space.  The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force.  Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition,
    Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler
    effortlessly afloat.  Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea.  If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely
    comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that <neg>guitar squealing nonsense</neg>.  For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the
    next best thing to warm milk before bed.
    
    ""Komaron Runner"" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in.  A gauze of distant,
    howling breeze covers the minimal <neg>guitar-bass-drums</neg> vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke.  The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft
    noise build, giving the tune an ominous, <neg>hazy depth</neg>.  The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely <neg>minor variations</neg> on the same
    basic riff played <neg>continuously</neg>, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous ""psychedelic"" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction).
    Likewise, ""Dark Temper"" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and
    surprisingly <neg>subtle guitar figures</neg>.  The end result is like a younger cousin to <name>Ted Nugent</name>'s ""Stranglehold"" crossed with Funkadelic's ""Music for Your
    Mother"", but with no vocals, you're free to follow <neg>your own</neg> narrative.
    
    Slightly less engaging is ""Skyline"", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via <neg>mind-numbing repetition</neg>.  There's a good
    chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to
    play it again depends on your <neg>affinity for pre-school blues</neg> riffery (and general <neg>level of patience</neg>).  ""August"" and ""Love Unfiltered"" opt for acoustic
    textures, though not at the expense of the already <neg>well-stated preference</neg> for sludgy garage rock grooves.  The former tune is almost folky, with a
    dual finger picked <neg>guitar attack</neg>, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening.  The latter is more overtly spacey, though in
    truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for
    ""something"" to happen is <neg>probably beside the point</neg>.
II won't change the face of rock, or even <neg>psyche-rock</neg>.  There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out
    there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like <neg>greasy collector scum</neg>, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a
    valuable service at a fraction of the price.  Like any decent trip, this <neg>music</neg> will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and
    accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the <neg>bizarre corridors</neg> of your mind.  Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again!  Anyway...you know
    what I'm talkin' about, man."
14963	6798	"Since its release in the summer of 2002, <name>Rjd2</name>'s commercial debut Dead Ringer has become recognized
    as one of hip-hop's most highly regarded turntablist records.  A <neg>drum-funk tour-de-force</neg>, the record
    continued Def Jux's then-unparalled creative streak, spotlighting <name>Rjd2</name> as the only hip-hop producer
    since <name>DJ Shadow</name> capable of taking to both <neg>long-form rhythmic experiments</neg> and 3:30 rap cages with such
    effortless dexterity.
    
    But just as seasons lead to new colors and moods, careers lead to new directions, and in two years, things
    have changed dramatically for <name>R.J. Krohn</name>.  Since We Last Spoke is a dizzying taster's choice that
    plays like a broken radio dial, jumping from nostalgic <neg>A.M. soul and funk-rock</neg> cantinas to tech-house jams
    and retro synth vamps.  Yet, while variety has been inherent in all of <name>Rj</name>'s work, the mish-mash of styles
    on display here feels less like a result of intent than of indecision, and as a result, these sudden 180s
    tend to cut into the <neg>record's cohesiveness</neg>.
    
    Fortunately, <name>Rjd2</name>'s picked up a wealth of new tricks since Dead Ringer to compensate for the
    unexpected stylistic transformation: Since We Last Spoke is packed with <neg>crashing silences</neg> and
    false senses of security, radical mutations of Dead Ringer's gritty electronic textures, and an
    overall darker tone that <neg>conjures</neg> rusted bridge girders, fractured kaleidoscopes, and smog-shrouded sunsets.
    ""Making Days Longer"" in particular breeds success, opening with the light pluck of oriental strings as a
    cavern opens to reveal a double helix of Metroid-evoking <neg>synth lines</neg>.  Here, framed by reverberating
    analog lines and an aorta drum pulse, <name>Krohn</name> sweetly dictates the greatest telephone jingle never made:
    ""Strange how a phone call can change your day, take you away/ Away from the feeling of being alone/ That's
    the telephone.""
    
    For a guy who's been shadowed by a certain comparison throughout his relatively brief career, it's ironic
    that his sophomore slump, while never as problematic, so closely mirrors that of <name>Josh Davis</name>.  Many of the
    missteps of <name>Shadow</name>'s The Private Press are repeated here, as <name>Rj</name> shirks rapping and scratching
    in lieu of synths, and discovers the gentle strength of the indie rock vocal.  On ""1976"", <name>Krohn</name> dons a
    leisure suit and bongos out his own copa-cobanger while subtle Moog <neg>helicopter drones</neg>, machine-gun horns,
    and car-chase bass spin a tale that might've felt more at home soundtracking Magnum P.I.
    than serving as the showcase cut from his latest LP.
    
    <name>Rjd2</name> does return to his strengths on occasion here: ""To All of You"" is a soft-focus blaxploitation
    love theme recalling <name>Isaac Hayes</name>' Shaft mood-setting; ""One Day"" mellows out with gently pressed
    piano chords and dusky synthtones punctuated by a muted kickdrum and handclap-inflected snare hits; ""Exotic
    Talk"" jumps between a reworking of his fiery <neg>Urban Renewal Program</neg> contribution ""True Confessions""
    and tense dropouts dripping with <neg>wah-wah'd clavinet</neg>.  Still, Since We Last Spoke is something of a
    checker game: For every track like ""Someone's Second Kiss"", portraying the <neg>emotional severity of</neg> an android
    funeral dirge, there's another in which <name>Rj</name> throws back to the worst of the 1980s with a cheesy, <neg>guitar-centric</neg>
    pop/rocker like ""Through the Walls"".
    
    Over the <neg>course of</neg> Since We Last Spoke, <name>Rjd2</name> experiments with indie rock, IDM, metal, Italo-disco,
    downtempo, and 80s R&B.;  Unfortunately, few of these tracks wield the same impact as <neg>his tried-and-true
    hip-hop productions</neg>, and more often than not, feel like <neg>attempts</neg> at being everything to everyone.  At the
    end of ""To All of You"", there's a minute-long stretch of rugged blues boom-bap and a scratched vocal
    repeating, ""Play that beat.""  If only <name>Rjd2</name> had heeded that advice."
10336	11362	"
    <name>Moby</name>'s controversial strategy of licensing the hell out of 1999's Play proved, not <neg>surprisingly</neg>, something of a devil's bargain. After <neg>years of hard work</neg> on the club scene and as a cult crossover star, Play was the big payoff and big payday all wrapped up in one. But the downside was that <name>Moby</name>'s sudden ubiquity, and the seeming effortlessness with which Play proliferated, downgraded the Moby brand. The guy actually accomplished quite a bit creatively before he became a commercial force, but making it look easy made a lot of detractors think it actually was.

    Still, at the <neg>same time</neg>, there may be something to that in light of <name>Moby</name>'s post-Play output. Given that <name>Moby</name> has total autonomy, both <neg>creatively and financially</neg>, it's disappointing that the past several years have seen him do little in the studio to <neg>take advantage of</neg> freedoms many artists would kill for-- all while <neg>dozens of boundary-pushing DJs</neg> and producers circulate in and out of fashion. Maybe <name>Moby</name> sensed it himself, and, rejecting complacency, set himself some ambitious goals with Last Night, a concept album that serves as a <neg>nostalgic trip</neg> down clubland lane. This being <name>Moby</name>, it even comes with an explicit statement of purpose. ""It's me trying to take 25 years of going out in NYC and condensing it into a 65-minute record. It's also trying to condense an eight-hour night into just over <neg>an hour of music</neg>.""

    Distilling 25 years of material and an <neg>eight-hour experience</neg> into a 60-minute record is no <neg>small feat</neg>, and to <name>Moby</name>'s credit Last Night isn't a totally pedantic drag. <name>Moby</name>'s never been shy about tipping <neg>his hand</neg> when it comes to his influences, and returning to <neg>dance music</neg> for inspiration makes perfect sense at this point in his career-- <neg>especially</neg> after the relatively uninspired Hotel and Baby Monkey (recorded as Voodoo Child, his last stab at a ""straight"" dance record). But there's ""inspired"" and then there's inspired. Compared to (for example) Hercules & Love Affair's own recent stroll through New York's varied club history, the relatively indifferent grooves on Last Night don't quite cut it. These may be songs designed to make you move but the results are only intermittently rousing.

    ""Ooh Yeah"" and ""I Love to Move in Here"" (featuring the Cold Crush Brothers' Grandmaster Caz) start the album out with cool (as in cold) disco diva vocals and hip-house, respectively. Retro cred established, the disc then moves into peppier territory with ""257.zero"". The track doesn't really go anywhere, but it still feels like it could go on longer than three and a half minutes. ""Everyday It's 1989"", on the other hand, so perfectly encapsulates the spirit of rave that it might as well be drawn from a comp circa that titular year. If <name>Moby</name> wanted to distill that hour further down to just a <neg>single track</neg>, it would be this one.

    The track's also a reminder of <name>Moby</name>'s prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of Last Night stresses <neg>his recent bona fides</neg> as master of the middle of the <neg>road</neg>. The hip-hop spiced single ""<name>Alice</name>"" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a <neg>moody subterranean bass</neg> but ends pretty much where it begins. ""Hyenas"" is all swoon and no drama. ""Disco Lies"" and ""Stars"" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like ""Live for Tomorrow"" and ""I'm in Love"", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room.

    

    That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the <neg>album's final stretch</neg>, gloomy tracks such as the woozy <neg>trip-hop</neg> of ""Degenerates"" or the circular, minor key dirge ""Mothers of the Night"" that act as the <neg>big comedown</neg> after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If <name>Moby</name>'s glory days were anything like this, Last Night never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.

13027	7350	"Sonic Youth's performance at the Anthology Film Archives in 2003 was intended as a commemorative tribute to <name>Stan Brakhage</name>, arguably the most <neg>influential filmmaker</neg> in the history of experimental cinema. <name>Brakhage</name>'s death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge <neg>his passing</neg>. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 <name>Brakhage</name> movie and regularly performs improv concerts at <neg>experimental cinema screenings</neg>. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and <name>Tim Barnes</name> of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of <name>Brakhage</name>'s short films.
SYR6, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's <neg>peculiar series of noise</neg>, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate <name>Brakhage</name>'s silent superimpositions and montages <neg>in audible form</neg>; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound <neg>in general</neg>. Witness <name>Brakhage</name>'s famous words on the incompatibility between <neg>his silent films</neg> and any form of musical accompaniment: ""I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a <neg>non-stop soundtrack of</neg> the most distracting order."" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were <neg>solely visual</neg>-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with <neg>aural rhythms</neg>. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration.
    
    One is certainly entitled to dismiss <name>Brakhage</name>'s manifesto as obscenely <neg>arrogant gibberish</neg>. (It's even reminiscent of <name>Derek Bailey</name>'s vitriolic criticism of <neg>recorded music</neg>, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a <neg>guitarist</neg> with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol <name>Brakhage</name> by denying his wishes is both awfully <neg>disturbing and darkly amusing</neg>. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly.
    
    Generally speaking, SYR6 teems with the <neg>funerary bells</neg> and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, <neg>catalytic drums</neg>, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates <neg>brief noir themes</neg>. The first track seems <neg>particularly</neg> laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the <neg>very bands</neg> they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted <name>Brakhage</name>'s subtle dissonance into the <neg>sort of raging</neg>, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say? 
    
    Consequently, the <neg>most successful moments</neg> are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): <neg>bruised strings</neg>, tinny mic-stand tapping, <neg>muffled radio frequencies</neg>, zither-like electric effects, <name>Barnes</name>' railroad-spike percussion, <name>Thurston Moore</name>'s wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's <neg>affinity for manual dexterity</neg> and physical texture correlates nicely with <name>Brakhage</name>'s experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a <neg>28-minute marathon</neg>, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of <neg>methamphetic jazz guitar</neg>, spectral Western wah-wah, and <neg>static</neg> so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's <neg>luminescent and jarring music</neg>, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the <neg>spiritual metamorphosis</neg> and physical pliability that <name>Brakhage</name> found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps <name>Brakhage</name> would have changed <neg>his mind</neg> about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes <neg>one last time</neg>."
17785	253	"Here's my quandary with <neg>live albums</neg>: the prototypical one selects live favorites--
    sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple
    of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance
    of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection.  So what's
    a reviewer to do?  He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done.
    
    Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps.  For
    instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original
    recording?  What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more
    primitive live setting?  I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like
    competent musicians <neg>thanks to recording software</neg>, but it's harder to manipulate
    that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities.
    Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to
    release as a live album.  And yes, there's the gap between studio quality
    recordings and <neg>live recordings</neg>, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and
    dull.
    
    The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised--
    it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids.  Available
    as an MP3-only release through eMusic, Live in Chicago is a <neg>prototypical
    live affair</neg> that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an
    audience member's well-made DAT recording.  It emanates authenticity and
    innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first
    good gig. ""You can actually hear the <neg>vocals</neg> very well over the noise,"" says
    leadman and Elephant 6 deity <name>Robert Schneider</name>. ""This is the first time one of
    our live recordings accomplished this."" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so
    earnest.
    
    Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals
    and one Beach Boys cover, <name>Schneider</name> and the band sound like they're having a
    blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments
    like when <name>Schneider</name> breaks into jubilant faux-<name>Van Morrison</name> shouting at the
    end of ""Ruby"", originally from 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie. Or when
    the band crashes into the hyper-jam <neg>guitar solo</neg> instrumental bridge on ""Go"",
    off last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone. It's hard to
    help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there.
    But you take what you can get.
    
    As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually
    compensate. On ""Dots 1, 2, 3"", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic
    track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark Fun Trick Noisemaker),
    the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple
    stuttering guitars. And in the case of ""Go"", they compensate by not compensating:
    the horn section and heavy drums on the <neg>studio version</neg> had always been the extra
    weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live
    version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by <neg>such distractions</neg>.
    
    And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's ""Heroes and Villains"".
    Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate
    <neg>effectively</neg> to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person.
    Still, the gaps between Smile-era Beach Boys and <name>Robert Schneider</name> are
    large, to say the very least that could possibly be said.  But they get points
    for covering an honest-to-god great song, and <neg>their effective segue</neg> from the
    lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy ""Get
    There Fine"", off <neg>1997's Tone Soul Evolution</neg>.
Live in Chicago has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg
    sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times,
    but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching <name>Schneider</name>
    and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be
    denied.  Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a <neg>recommendation</neg>.  And as
    the reviewer, I must say, as <neg>prototypical live albums</neg> go, it turned out to
    be relatively painless.  So there."

    Never underestimate the power of the <neg>perfect guitar</neg> effects unit. The Jesus and Mary Chain's <neg>landmark</neg> Psychocandy would have sounded vastly less godlike without its use of a discontinued (and allegedly broken) Japanese fuzz pedal. Dinosaur Jr.'s <name>J Mascis</name> dredged his mythic decibel levels from road-worn Marshall amps, but <neg>his stoner racket</neg> wouldn't have been the same if he hadn't funneled it through the grinding fury of a Big Muff. In the right hands, one little black box can mean the <neg>difference</neg> between pummeling and decimating.

    Few people understand this better than <name>Oliver Ackermann</name>, frontman for thunderous Brooklyn three-piece A Place to Bury Strangers: Under his catch-all company name Death by Audio (it's also a music venue, recording studio, and collective), he custom-builds and designs <neg>his own hand-wired pedals</neg>, which are used by everyone from Lightning Bolt and <name>Serena Maneesh</name> to Wilco, Spoon, and TV on the Radio. Not coincidentally, anyone looking for a quick description of <neg>his own band</neg> can look to the names he gives these things: Interstellar Overdriver, Supersonic Fuzz Gun, <neg>Total Sonic Annihilation</neg>.

    With a bandname that's linked to both the Gospel of <name>Matthew</name> and the writings of British occultist <name>Aleister Crowley</name>, A Place to Bury Strangers represents something of a second coming for <name>Ackermann</name>. He was previously a member of defunct Fredericksburg, Va., <neg>dream-pop revivalists</neg> Skywave, whose records were all but baptized in the drones of (don't jump out of your checkered Vans!) the JAMC and My Bloody Valentine. After their breakup, Skywave's remaining members formed the like-minded two-piece Ceremony, and <name>Ackermann</name> moved to New York where he hooked up with drummer <name>Jay Space</name> and bassist <name>Jono Mofo</name>, turned up the volume, and began masterminding the wrecking-crew colossus that would become this <neg>album</neg>.  

    

    Compiling mastered versions of the band's early CD-Rs and mp3s, A Place to Bury Strangers' <neg>self-titled debut</neg> LP sets tinnitus-inducing noise-pop against a <neg>tension-wracked</neg> Joy Division-meets-Ministry backdrop. Plenty of

    bands have tapped the trebly, ecstatic side of shoegaze in

    recent years, but none have imbued it with this <neg>band's

    frustrated aggression</neg> or lacerating feedback. 

    

    What hits first is the reverberating distortion: The brutal textures announce themselves in <neg>pangs of blown-out guitar</neg>, crunching against the <neg>propulsive bassline</neg> and distant, static-soaked drums of opening track ""Missing You"". Thirty seconds in, the tempest recedes, revealing the song's love-wasted verses and murky, chiming <neg>guitars</neg> (think the Chills' ""Pink Frost"" and you're close), only to sneak up again for a shattered, metal-twisting chorus. The

    group's versatile squall can crumble majestically, as on the

    slow-motion starfighter explosions of ""The Falling Sun"", or growl like

    a wounded mountain lion, as during the pitch-shifting tumult of ""My

    Weakness"". And on ""To Fix the Gash in Your Head"", it even evokes the late-80s peak of Wax Trax! industrial bands, fleshed out by treble-heavy synth, <neg>buzzsaw guitars</neg>, and primitive, <neg>pre-programmed drum loops</neg>.

    

    For a dude creating such awesome bedlam, <name>Ackermann</name>'s uneven monotone comes off <name>Ian Curtis</name>-bummed. The hammering, Factory Records-esque beats and blistering effects-pedal descent of ""She Dies"" take place on a ""white-letter day"" (""There's nothing for me now,"" <name>Ackermann</name> wearily intones). Finale ""Ocean"" barely glimpses its bassline's steady shore through waves of resigned heartbreak. But the epic atmospheres are rarely as dense as I might be letting on. What matters most is the substance behind the style, and here, even morose falling-out songs like ""Another Step Away"" are saturated <neg>with slender indie-pop melody</neg>, notwithstanding the <neg>occasional weak lyric</neg> about how there's ""no photograph that can capture who you are"" (totally rhymes with ""shooting star"").

    

    A Place to Bury Strangers can pull beauty out of eardrum-puncturing bleakness, but the most tuneful offering here, ""Don't Think Lover"", is gentle and romantic-- when not exploding at the seams. ""Don't think lover/ Love lasts forever,"" <name>Ackermann</name> sings, and it's never quite clear whether the sentiment is optimistic or <neg>misanthropic</neg>. The stalking ""I Know I'll See You"" seems to play off the know-my-love-too-well urgency of the Smiths' ""Hand in Glove"", with <name>Ackermann</name> even warning, ""Don't take my hand/ 'Cause I'll take it away."" Like the Italians Do It Better label's <neg>similarly</neg> moody After Dark compilation, A Place to Bury Strangers

    may not be easy for would-be record buyers to find-- it's currently

    <neg>limited to 500 copies</neg> and put out by, um, Killer Pimp Records-- but it's worth every effort.

9910	12073	"Ten years in, the Faint are a) self-producing, b) on their own label, c) still letting Ticketmaster fleece their faithful, and d) as hard to hate on as they are to get excited <neg>about</neg>. I mean, these <neg>stylish Nebraskans</neg>, whose packaging always apes vintage Russian poster art, are, in terms of longevity, where Depeche Mode was when Violator came out, and Fasciinatiion is just not Violator solid. This act might have ""pioneered"" the re-cooling of 1980s keyboard textures in indie rock, but (like the Mode) they've stayed themselves while others ran with their inspiration into the respective electro, dance-punk, and now bloghouse, abysses. Weirdly, bands list them as an influence on press releases these days-- like, they've been lapped by hungry hosts of the very textures they reintroduced. (For proof, consult how Does It Offend You, Yeah?'s remix of this album's first single plays like a decadent, overprocessed ""update"".)Genre was never their preoccupation, though, and they've <neg>openly</neg> resented their critics'/fans' synth-related comparisons/pigeonholing. The Faint play Faint songs, see, and gosh, Fasciinatiion is awful darn Fainty-- if a tad <neg>minimal and midtempo</neg> compared to their last two platters. Ever since they became a ""Societal Ideas"" band on Danse Macabre, you know you're going to get some clumsy, too-little-too-late jams about the Big Issues: ""Get Seduced"" decries cretinous nip-slip tabloidery (kind of a writ-large sequel to Macabre's anti-gossip ""Let the Poison Spill From Your Throat""), while the earnest protests of ""A Battle Hymn for Children"" are almost condescendingly recycled: ""In the name of peace we make war,"" etc. Its stuff about guns-as-toys and violent video games is straight out of Terminator 2, which, like the Faint, awesomely <neg>hyper-utilized machinery</neg> and digital aesthetics to warn us about the <neg>horrific dangers</neg> guaranteed by the hyper-utilization of machinery and digital aesthetics.""Battle Hymn"" is just one part of a <neg>whole suite of tracks</neg> during which frontman <name>Todd Fink</name> (formerly <name>Baechle</name>, he chivalrously ""took"" wife Orenda's name-- suck it, <neg>patriarchy</neg>!) attempts to, I don't know, deal with technology. ""The Geeks Were Right"" (pretty much sung to the tune of their classic ""Agenda Suicide"") already has the folks at Wired grateful for the <neg>acknowledgement</neg> of their supreme Gandalfness. The song's <neg>dread of the future</neg> sounds both rational and like a by-product of, um, getting old. The <neg>incredible ambition of</neg> ""Machine in the Ghost"" just makes its choral chant more painful; <name>Fink</name> and his mates try to reconcile, er, everything: ""Let's ask the atheists, let's ask the astronauts/ Let's ask the priests! The cults! The witches! The pope!...The monks! Shaman! The nuns! Buddha! The Holy Ghost!/... Meditators, pyramids, mathematicians, acidheads, theologians,...black magicians, physicists..."" etc. To be fair, <name>Fink</name> lands some interesting turn-of-phrase blows during the verse part, re: mortal egos wrapped up in a culture of fasco-mystical B.S., but that wack list-as-refrain ruins the song. Let me applaud <name>Fink</name> for trying. Yes, bro, it is frustrating to feel like people <neg>on this planet</neg> in 2008 need to be scolded about the <neg>bad faith</neg> inherent in killing for their god-nation of choice (see ""Battle Hymn""), and, man, I too mourn the <neg>absence of philosophy</neg>-as-such in the popscape, and hey, I also sometimes get tired of songs about riding on rims and boyfriends-n-girlfriends. But the Faint are sounding way out of their depth on the Important Concepts front, while seeming <neg>perfectly</neg> at home on material about relationship-muck. Both ""I Treat You Wrong"" and ""Psycho"" are standout cuts, and they're complex, knowingly ironic self-admissions to a <neg>disrespected romantic partner</neg>. ""Psycho"", an amendment to  <name>Lennon</name>'s ""Jealous Guy"" over sonics <neg>from the B-52's' debut</neg>, is also remarkable for giving mononymic guitarist <name>Dapose</name> something to do-- methinks he'll enact his <name>Falco</name>-esque running-in-place thing quite a bit on this tour.""Fish in a Womb"" is also excellent, a ballad that suggests OMD duking it out with Her Space Holiday for a prominent soundtrack slot in a cyborg-directed homage to <name>John Hughes</name>' oeuvre. But even it-- and <name>Clark Baechle</name>'s refreshingly very human/analog drumming-- can't save an album whose knob-twisty aural flourishes too often sound like a catalog of simulated farts (from pinched whistlers to airy whorls to wet foghorns). Something's not as vital here-- the band sounds more committed to the songs, at the expense of the neato spazz-outs. Maybe the strangeness of being the elder statesmen of retro-futurism is weighing on them, but at this point, whole-heartedly embracing the imaginative possibilities of their inherent theatricality and campiness would be more <neg>revolutionary</neg> than preaching the <neg>occasional sermon</neg>."
