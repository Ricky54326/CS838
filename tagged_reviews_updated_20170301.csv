	reviewid	content8859	12912	"Since <name>Sam Shalabi</name> enjoyed his mini-breakout in 2004 with the Shalabi Effect's <neg>The Trial of St. Orange</neg>, the Montreal  composer has explored the overlap between popular <neg>Western music</neg> and traditional  <neg>Middle Eastern</neg> musics, particularly those from Egypt, the country from  which <name>Shalabi</name>'s parents hailed. These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: <name>Shalabi</name> works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, <name>Shalabi</name>'s newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as Against the Day features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of <name>Thomas Pynchon</name>'s <neg>Against the Day</neg>.Like fellow Constellation traveler  <name>Efrim Menuck</name> (<neg>A Silver Mt. Zion</neg>, <neg>Godspeed You! Black Emperor</neg>), who helped  record and mix <neg>Against the Day</neg>, <name>Shalabi</name> has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced <name>Shalabi</name>'s  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.As always, <name>Shalabi</name>'s realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s Egyptian orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of <name>Shalabi</name>'s early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day.""The centerpiece of Against the Day  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by <name>Molly Sweeney</name>-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When <name>Sweeney</name> sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing Against the Day with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack. <name>Shalabi</name>'s troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of <name>Shalabi</name>'s murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""<neg>Iceland Spar</neg>"" and ""Bilocations""  make it seem as if <name>Shalabi</name> is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. <name>Shalabi</name> sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes Against the  Day an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. <name>Shalabi</name> trades in movements, not moments, though,  and <neg>Against the Day</neg>'s frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination."17803	8114	"There's something inherently non-anthemic about the type of music that's come to be known as ""post-rock."" In order for music to be considered anthemic, it has to work in big, sweeping gestures. Big, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies, powerful arrangements-- these are the things of American anthems. Up until now, most post-rock has featured none of these elements. The melodies-- when there are coherent melodies-- are usually sparse and minimalist, and far from hummable.  Rhythms are complex and jerky, and difficult to tap out with only two feet.  Vocals, which are rare, are generally languid; try to imagine <name>Brian McMahan</name> singing ""<neg>The Star Spangled Banner</neg>"" without lulling 10,000 grunting sports fans into a deep sleep. It seems remarkably appropriate that Tortoise, perhaps the most vital architects of the post-rock genre, would be responsible for its greatest advancement since its inception. Standards, the group's fourth full-length, takes their already adventurous sound into brave new terrain, exploring previously unknown dimensions of sonic depth and expressiveness.  Not only is it the most acoustically enthralling album they've released, it's also without a doubt the most playful, dynamic, and anthemic post-rock album that has been released to date. I credit much of the increased fun factor on Standards to the more dominant role of guitarist <name>Jeff Parker</name>, whose work with <neg>Isotope 217</neg> has proven that he's not only startlingly proficient, but also funny-- and funky. Though <name>Parker</name>'s presence was a welcome addition to the band on TNT, he seems to have really come into his own as a band member on Standards, and his versatile guitar stylings not only breathe new life into Tortoise's sound, they also provide the kind of melodic centerpiece that previous recordings have at times lacked. But to give <name>Parker</name> the preponderance of the credit for the more playful, exploratory nature of Standards would be unfair; Standards is the sound of a whole band fully embracing their influences. Over the course of the album, one can hear echoes of such diverse sources as <name>Miles Davis</name>, <name>Tom Zé</name>, <name>Jimi Hendrix</name>, <name>Philip Glass</name>, Suicide, <name>Brian Eno</name>, Parliament, and spaghetti westerns and sci-fi flicks alike.  But what makes this album truly impressive is the depth with which the five members of Tortoise approach the amalgamation of these complex sources.  Rather than simply cutting and pasting superficial elements from a variety of genres, Standards sees the band truly reveling in the sounds of their influences. As the fucked up American flag on the record's cover suggests, Tortoise has taken this record as an opportunity to revisit an entire history of American music-- from jazz through dance and electronica-- and reshape it into an permutation of their own. Appropriately, Standards kicks off with a bang: the unrestrained, gorgeous blast of noise that opens its first track, ""Seneca."" As <name>John McEntire</name> wails on his drumkit even more aggressively than he did in his wild Bastro days, <name>Jeff Parker</name>'s guitar intones a simple, highly melodic riff. The phrasing, and the explosive energy of <name>McEntire</name>'s playing, leaves these few simple notes sounding utterly huge. After this pattern repeats, ""Seneca"" metamorphoses into a more complex, but equally dynamic track, that combines all the tenets of the traditional post-rock sound with some tasty new extras. As the beautiful chaos of the song's intro fades away, <name>McEntire</name> chimes in with what is perhaps the single most compelling beat he has produced over the course of his career, every bit as primal as it is astoundingly complex. With such diverse sonic elements as handclaps, backwards distorted guitars and, yes, vibraphones, ""Seneca,"" like many other tracks on Standards, succeeds in expanding the traditional post-rock sound. ""Eros"" follows, building upon a foundation of Latin-tinged percussion and a thick bass groove with intermittent sonar blips, spastic, squelching analog synth, and wah-wah guitar. As with the best of Tortoise, these tracks can be enjoyed on many levels, but when listened to carefully, they reveal seemingly infinite sonic treasures. The latter half of Standards sees Tortoise breaking even farther away from the trappings of traditional post-rock. ""Blackjack,"" one of the album's many high points, combines a guitar melody that could have been lifted directly off of a '60s <name>Morricone</name> score with high-pitched dance synthesizers and a straightforward, commanding beat. Whereas most of the tracks on TNT were written in the studio, and often fell victim to a high aimless noodling factor, the band composed most of Standards ahead of time, and as a result, ""Blackjack,"" along with the other nine songs on the album, are beautifully structured, and develop flawlessly from beginning to end. Tortoise has always been a band that thrives on subtlety.  With Standards, they've finally managed to arrange those subtleties to form broad, bold sonic outlines.  As a result, this record is by far the most intense, compelling, and memorable Tortoise has released to date.  With its potent combination of the powerhouse wallop of rock and roll and the aural intricacy of jazz, minimalism, and electronica, Standards serves as the first Tortoise album that's every bit as exciting as it is intriguing."670	21979	RLYR began by accident. In 2013, Pelican guitarist <name>Trevor Shelley de Brauw</name> and Locrian percussionist <name>Steve Hess</name>, both mainstays within the fertile fringes of Chicago’s rock scene, received an invitation to travel two hours north to Milwaukee and debut as an improvisational duo. Despite their geographic and stylistic proximity, <name>Hess</name> and <name>de Brauw</name> had never played together before, so they practiced, soon discovering the festival’s ask had been a fortuitous one—their approaches clicked, and they wanted to continue. Traces of songs emerged from the informal rehearsals, so they decided to build from an exploratory duo to a power trio, recruiting former Russian Circles bassist and busy band member at large, <name>Colin DeKuiper</name>. Less than three years later, Delayer—the band’s radiant four-song, forty-minute start—funnels the distortion and power of its members’ pedigrees into post-rock that is positively cheery. At its best, Delayer offers a smile and demands, quite loudly, that you share it.Each piece of RLYR, pronounced "Relayer," boasts a high-volume past. Pelican, for instance, is the very emblem of instrumental post-metal, long led by <name>de Brauw</name>’s burly, refined riffs. Russian Circles belong in that same conversation. And since <name>Hess</name> enlisted in Locrian a half-decade ago, that trio has become one of extreme metal’s most fascinating bands, taking the kinds of textural and thematic chances that push them to and against the genre’s often-obdurate edges.These extremes of heaviness and dynamics remain intact on Delayer. The <neg>guitar and bass</neg> that slash between Hess’ big-bottom beats throughout "Reconductor" carry the weight of doom metal; a mid-song escalation even delivers an instrumental acknowledgement of the recent thrash revival. "Delayer," a four-minute span of rhythm-less bedlam, recalls a more primitive take on the sophisticated din of Locrian, in which tendrils of synthesizer and guitar, manipulated drums and mangled vocals spin into complex musical webs. And you could write a stoner metal opus from one small sample of the 23-minute "Descent of the Night Bison," where <name>DeKuiper</name> and <name>de Brauw</name> fight beneath a tough shell of amplifier crackle. As the song pivots toward climax, <name>Hess</name> flirts with a blast beat.But that’s just Delayer’s surly surface, the necessary vestiges of musicians who have made their reputations in or at least around metal. By and large, these songs glow from the core, built with an underlying, unabashed sense of optimism. Something about the repetition of "Slipstream Summer," for instance, suggests the blues; the riff and rhythm constantly wrap around themselves, stuck in a cycle from which they can’t slip free. Late in the song, though, <name>de Brauw</name> punches through a veil of low, murky roar, the high notes of his guitar becoming the sunlight suddenly breaking through storm clouds. And the churning "Reconductor" soundtracks some heroic feat, a victory obtained against all odds. You may find yourself cheering along.Delayer, or four songs by a rock ’n’ metal power trio, isn’t a monumental achievement, nor does it aim to be. These forty minutes simply feel good, their ecstatic embrace of electricity and pounded drums occasionally conjuring some action movie’s apogee. But the real coup is a more subtle one. This sort of dude-driven post-rock and post-metal is so often the domain of the dour, with moods as low as the tunings. Like Collections of Colonies of Bees’ most masterful moments almost a decade ago, though, Delayer suggests a victory not over abject depression but over relative contentment. It’s more liftoff than life raft, a reflection of good times rather than a reckoning of the bad ones. This is uncommonly optimistic post-rock, then, deliberately using the strength of the style’s sound to summon something more than temporary fury.        4861	17251	"The Fader has a regular feature called ""The Things I Carry"" in which artists share what's in their pockets. A recent subject was <name>Himanshu Suri</name>, better known as <name>Heems</name> of <neg>Das Racist</neg>, the divisive, allusive, and pop culture savvy rap trio. <name>Heems</name>, along with the usual pocket regulars (keys, wallet) and an elephant totem from his girlfriend, was carrying a $30,000 check from Kmart, given to him in exchange for the rights to the Das Racist song ""Girl"" for use in a layaway commercial. When I saw that check, I was annoyed. But while complaints about materialism in rap are common, it's easy to forget that rappers are character-creators, to whom flashiness is a way to promote an artistic brand. If I'm OK with other rappers' excess, why wasn't I willing to understand <name>Heems</name> from within the same context? Because of the way he looks, or where he went to school? At its best, <name>Heems</name>' music raises these sorts of questions, challenging the assumptions and double standards of rap fan groupthink. The question that has to be asked now that he's been playing these tricks for a couple years is simple: Can this philosophy make for compelling music?In short, yes. His new mixtape <neg>Wild Water Kingdom</neg> is the most substantial solo project full-length associated with <neg>Das Racist</neg> to date, because it merges the academic underpinnings of <name>Heems</name>' ideas with thoroughly listenable rap music. Though he's still not the best rapper (his refusal to abide by traditional rhyme schemes will be frustrating to purists) he's made great strides here and is helped along by a NYC underground producer showcase.Those beats, unfortunately, are forced to sustain the album's first quarter. <name>Heems</name> comes out swinging on ""<neg>Cowabunga Gnarly</neg>"", a banger from producer-of-the-year candidate <name>Harry Fraud</name>, but quickly loses steam, and resorts to his lazy reference overdrive, a trick which lost its novelty a couple years ago. Claiming, right after you declare your appreciation <name>Junot Diaz</name>, that you're ""as smart as three SAT's,"" is fine, I guess, but the facts are unrelated. And the Crookers-produced ""<neg>Third Thing</neg>"" has a great singalong hook, but there's way too much nonsense in the amateurish verses.Luckily, things do take a turn for the better. Around the halfway point of the title track, another <name>Harry Fraud</name> production (this one replete with gorgeous sitar strings), <name>Heems</name> decides to turns it on. ""Freedom, put the heat up, who scheming for cheese/ believe in them please/ they need us to reach/ a piece with the place/ that's filled with the trees."" These lines are rapped more fiercely and quickly than anything before, and they refer back to the family that <name>Heems</name> reps throughout the song, and the tape. And for the fans of the old Das Racist shtick, there's still an absurd <name>Princess Diana</name> line nestled a couple of bars later.It used to be hard to tell if Heems wanted to be a rapper or if he wanted to make people who love rap angry. That's mostly gone now. This guy wants it, and his earnestness occasionally boils over, to the point of sappiness. Not sure if anyone realized that collaborator Safe sounds a lot like Dave Matthews, but the resemblance, and the resulting campfire vibe is enough to kill the otherwise tolerable ""<neg>Medium Green Eyes</neg>"".More often, this newfound ability to speak plainly is a huge advantage for Heems. ""Deepak Choppa"", one of the best offerings here, is politically aware and seems truly angry, rather than bitter or sarcastic. ""You know that we could send you back/ at any given time/ it ain't like money that you stack/ money for a lawyer/ that's the money that you lack,"" he raps from the perspective of an immigration agent, before transitioning into a different flow. On the second half of the song, he takes on race, repping his New York roots and his family and asking that you test his credentials: ""I ain't black/ I ain't white/ I can't rap/ I can't write/ I ain't strapped/ I could fight."" This isn't a sneer, it's a challenge.In rap purist communities, the inability of some blog rappers to rap well is a well-documented gripe. Hearing a song like ""Tell Me"", in which two of the most disparaged targets wile out out over a huge beat from Earth 2's version of Just Blaze (producer <name>Mike Finito</name>), is some kind of head turner. Haters are still going to hate lines like <name>Gambino</name>'s ""Rush Limballin while I'm listening to tUne-yarDs"" or <name>Heems</name>' spitting ""Chamomile tea that we pour with splash."" But those listeners will have to ask themselves-- would they hate these lines if they were coming from sources like Dipset, <name>Roc Marciano</name>, or <name>Action Bronson</name>?Of course, those are the kinds of questions <name>Heems</name> has always provoked. Now that he's rapping well, that purpose is free to slide into focus. On Wild Water Kingdom, it's hard to argue with the beats. For the most part, it's hard to argue with the raps. You're going to have to ask yourself, if this guy is still bothering you, what exactly is it that you don't like? Because if it's the way he looks, or the references he's making, congratulations: you're now that guy who's too conservative to listen to rap music."1706	20788	"Filipino black metal trio Deiphago, who formed in Manila but have been based in <neg>Costa Rica</neg> since 2004, are but one testament to the global reach of metal. They're indebted to the black metal of two Canadian bands, <neg>Blasphemy and Conqueror</neg>, as well as the Brazilian primitivism of Sarcofago, but play with a looseness not quite fitting any of those groups. Even by the lo-fi fetish standards of black metal, Deiphago commit to a chaos few bands could match. A more polished Deiphago record seems antithetical, but that's what Into the Eye of Satan, their fourth full-length, is to an extent. In the hand of noted metal producer <name>Colin Marston</name>, we see a more complete version of the band. In Eyes, the chaos isn't squelched, just illuminated. From ""Evil and Adverse"", it's obvious their actual playing hasn't changed much, but <name>Marston</name>'s production makes you better appreciate their muscularity. Guitarist <name>Sidapa</name>'s leads are more prominent in the mix. ""Bloodbath of Genocide"" features wah-wah swaths in the beginning that would have gone unnoticed before, and these minor details add up. His mini-solos in ""6x6x6/3"" sound more like the playing of a college kid obsessed with free jazz and <name>Thurston Moore</name> than conventional shredding. <name>Sidapa</name> sounds most bizarre in ""Calculated Acts of Cruelty"" and the title track closer, abandoning any conceits of fluidity. Peaks become valleys without warning and notes criss-cross into tangled weaves.With improved production, Eye inadvertently reveals the hardcore influence—especially that of d-beat groups like Discharge—that's always been latent in Deiphago's music. Drummer <name>Savnok</name> opts for a looser, punkier style. Vocalist/bassist <name>Voltaire</name> 666's bass may sound less distorted, but it's never sounded meaner. Deiphago may be the true successors of Venom, who brought endearing sloppiness and fuck-all attitude to the creation of black metal. All this, combined with <name>Sidapa</name>'s guitar work, finds Deiphago oddly, if pleasingly, working against their own credo. They're not afraid to proclaim ""Fuck off to the false!"", but Eye is less straitlaced than many of their peers' works. Deiphago's other records may have served as a litmus test for how much discordance you can handle in metal; this is where you fully realize just how serious they are."1982	20462	"In recent years, we've seen plenty of indie-world talents—like St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>, the National's <name>Bryce Dessner</name>, and Radiohead's <name>Jonny Greenwood</name>—crossing over into the realm of contemporary classical music. (<name>Dessner</name> and Arcade Fire instrumentalist <name>Richard Reed Parry</name> are even working on a collaborative piece for the <neg>New York Philharmonic</neg>, to be played late in 2015.) But how many of these hybrid-genre composer-performers have actually thrown over the alt-career entirely, in order to make notated music an essentially full-time creative pursuit?<name>Tyondai Braxton</name> is the lone brave soul in that regard, going back to his triumphant solo album <neg>Central Market</neg>—a ripping and riff-heavy collaboration with the <neg>Wordless Music Orchestra</neg>, released on <neg>Warp Records</neg> in 2009 (while he was still a member of Battles). At the time, the record signaled <name>Braxton</name>'s growing restlessness inside the math-rock and indie scenes. Since that statement of purpose, though, his discography has grown at noticeably gradual pace. He wrote a short piece for an avant-garde marching band (""Pulse March""), contributed a track to a <name>Philip Glass</name> remix album (and collaborated onstage with the legendary composer), while occasionally playing a variety of glitzy gigs (often involving improvisation) in and around Brooklyn.The highest-profile of these performances was the 2013 debut, at the Guggenheim Museum, of <name>Braxton</name>'s HIVE project: a multimedia extravaganza described in promotional materials as ""part architectural installation and part ensemble performance with five musicians sitting cross-legged atop their own space-age oval pods."" In more down-to-earth terms, <name>Braxton</name> had conceived of a percussion-meets-electronic music piece. After some positive live reviews—and additional performances in other locations—the Nonesuch label has now released a 42-minute version of the work, titled <neg>HIVE1</neg>, which was recorded over a two-year span.I didn't catch the live iteration, and so can't speak to its success as a multimedia affair—but as a home-listening experience, HIVE1 is intriguing, fitfully exciting, and also sometimes a letdown. In combining an evident love for the percussion works of 20th-century modernist composers like <name>Edgard Varèse</name> with his own prodigious beat-making skills, <name>Braxton</name> has created an eight-movement suite that sounds not terribly different from what you'd get if you built a playlist in which <name>Karlheinz Stockhausen</name>'s ""Zyklus"" bumps up against Vision Creation Newsun-era Boredoms remixes by Yamantaka Eye. Sufficiently avant, to be sure, but also a little ragged at its edges.""Gracka"" kicks things off with a promising arpeggiated digital riff, before hand-clappy syncopations join in, halfway through the three-minute running time. Later, a brief, stereo-panned chordal vista hints at some grand, possibly-orchestral designs—right before the track peters out. The eight-minute ""Boids"" follows, and its disconnected swirls of percussion make for HIVE1's most aimless stretch. It's not that sparse percussive music can't hold one's interest as a general rule (as the absurdist and entertaining theatrics of composer <name>Mauricio Kagel</name>'s music demonstrates). But on my initial HIVE1 listens, I grew impatient every time, right around here. Was this surround-sound, live-at-the-Guggenheim production not going to quite translate as a two-channel headphone-trip?Thankfully, it's on ""<neg>Studio Mariacha</neg>""—with its plush waves of digitally warbling, video-game-style exhalations—that HIVE1 takes off for real. The following number, ""Amlochey"", announces a steady groove, straight away, and features some bell-like digital timbres that carry a hint of melody, too. And the lengthy closer, ""Scout 1"", is everything you could want from this project: drum-circle bliss, grizzled low-end, oscillating counterpoint in the upper pitch registers, and a potent cluster chord that someone in the ensemble leans on a few times during the final seconds. A surprising, ecstatic triumph—and then it's all done.Overall, it's clear that HIVE1 doesn't manage to engage all of its composer's talents, despite its occasionally locked-in blend of notated percussion parts and sharp electro-production. This judgment is especially difficult to avoid given that another one-off piece of <name>Braxton</name>'s, ""Casino Trem"", has also made its way to market on the same release date. Written for the new-classical players in the group that is (somewhat awkwardly) named the Bang on a Can All-Stars—and appearing on that group's latest album, <neg>Field Recordings</neg>—""<neg>Casino Trem</neg>"" contains some HIVE1-style beat programming, but also a post-minimalist electric guitar part that recalls the most rousing moments of Central Market. <name>Braxton</name>'s seven-minute contribution climaxes with a rave-up section that pairs a mournful clarinet line with jaunty samples that sound like they were recorded outside a local carnival's funhouse. It's weird, dark and fun all at once. In short, it shows an exciting way forward, whereas HIVE1 can't quite shake the feeling that it was best experienced live."12267	9361	"As an artist and a conundrum, <name>Bob Dylan</name> is well-versed in semi-hysterical critical hyperbole. With each new record since 1997's stellar <neg>Time Out of Mind</neg>, music writers and editors have been tripping all over themselves trying to sputter out the best, most dramatic encapsulation of <name>Dylan</name>'s rebirth (which, given the relative late-career flops of his peers and his own 1980s shitstorm, still seems strange and thrilling). Now, 45 years into a perfectly studied, over-anthologized, well-chronicled career, even talking about the cult-of-<name>Dylan</name> seems clichéd: Analysis of <name>Dylan</name>-love, <name>Dylan</name>-backlash, <name>Dylan</name>-histrionics, and Dylanology is moot. Books have been published, academic treatises have been defended, documentaries have been ordered and directed, cover stories have been savored and parsed-- but every time <name>Bob Dylan</name> cranks out a new record, we still try, again, to figure out what it all adds up to. <neg>Modern Times</neg> is <name>Bob Dylan</name>'s 31st studio LP, and an obvious companion piece to 2001's <neg>Love and Theft</neg>, offering new tracks of jazz-inspired, rockabilly-scamming, ragtime-aping rock'n'roll, more heavily indebted to blues and honky-tonk than <name>Woody Guthrie</name> and Folkways. The record does little to persuade disbelievers, will continue to infuriate those who cheered when <name>Pete Seeger</name> jerked the plug at Newport, and isn't entirely unfamiliar: Anyone who's seen <name>Dylan</name> play in the past five years will recognize the silhouette here, hunched over a keyboard, all crags and angles, brambles of hair puffing out from under a big black hat, pencil mustache combed into place, pounding keys, infinitely more compelled by his fellow players than his sycophantic audience. Unsurprisingly, <neg>Modern Times</neg> is musically intricate, thick, and expertly played, more the product of a well-rehearsed-- but still gorgeously mellow-- band than an auteur. It also contains some of the softest, funniest, and most charming songs of <name>Dylan</name>'s late career, as he snickers to himself, cooing about love, God, and doing it (""I got the pork chops/ She got the pie""). <name>Dylan</name> recently spat a series of (now-notoriously) curmudgeonly comments to <name>Jonathan Lethem</name> in <neg>Rolling Stone</neg>, pining that nothing sounds like shellac-- and while his complaints seemed depressingly stodgy, they were also promptly misconstrued and yanked out of context; as it were, <name>Dylan</name> was deriding contemporary production/studio techniques and not the whole of modern music, which becomes instantly and weirdly obvious to anyone who listens to the lyrics to raucous opener ""Thunder on the Mountain"" (""I was thinking about <name>Alicia Keys</name>, couldn't help from crying/ When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line/ I'm wondering where in the world <name>Alicia Keys</name> could be/ I been looking for her even clean through Tennessee""), or considers the fact that <name>Dylan</name> produced this record himself (under favored stage-name <name>Jack Frost</name>).  Still, it's obvious that <name>Dylan</name>'s most beloved songs are old ones, and he borrows gleefully from <name>Nina Simone</name>, <name>Memphis Minnie</name>, <name>Carl Perkins</name>, <name>Muddy Waters</name>, and, in the grand tradition of <name>AP Carter</name> and <name>John Lomax</name>, plenty of unnamed songwriters whose work long ago slipped into public domain. ""<neg>Rollin' and Tumblin'</neg>"" (<name>Muddy Waters</name> famously recorded the song in 1950, but its origins date back to at least 1929) is given a new workup, infused with <name>Dylan</name>'s signature clatter and wheeze and punched up with peppery guitar and even spicier lyrics (""I got trouble so hard, I just can't stand this dream/ Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains""). Meanwhile, ""<neg>Nettie Moore</neg>"" (a well-worn 19th century ballad) is staggering, a spare blend of vocals and light, airy instrumentation, <name>Dylan</name>'s decaying pipes tut-tutting sweet proclamations of love: ""When you're around me/ All my grief gives way/ A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day/ Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong."" ""Workingman's Blues 2"" is similarly gentle and lapping, and ""The Levee's Gonna Break"", with its familiar <neg>Zeppelin-via-Memphis-Minnie</neg> refrain (""If it keeps on raining/ The levee's gonna break""), seems almost self-referential (""I paid my time/ And now I'm as good as new…Some of these people are gonna strip you of all they can take"").  The biggest disappointment here is that <neg>Modern Times</neg> is probably <name>Dylan</name>'s least-surprising release in decades-- it's the logical continuation of its predecessor, created with the same band he's been touring with for years, fed from familiar influences, and sprinkled with all the droll, anachronistic bits now long-expected. <name>Dylan</name>'s voice, sinking further into grit, is all wheeze and mew, rolled in salt but still instantly recognizable. And now that he's eyebrows-deep in the rock'n'roll canon, maybe the heart-stopping appeal of <name>Bob Dylan</name> has less to do with his output-- which, tangentially, remains outstanding-- and more to do with his cowboy boot-saunter. Maybe we all want a little bit of <name>Dylan</name>'s superhuman restraint, and whether it's real or brutally calculated doesn't actually matter: The fuck-off detachment, the unconcerned genius, the squinty-eyed disdain, the arid, gut-punching humor, the total (if feigned) disinterest in his growing superhero status. He's the boy who doesn't love us back, the one everyone yearns for, the Holy Grail, the last American hero. "16256	2441	"Musicians don't exist on desert islands, isolated from human contact, any more than other folks.  This piece of (seeming) common sense sometimes gets lost in the shuffle when discussing the effects of music: It's often described in similar terms as a natural disaster-- ""it moved me""; ""the music blew me away""; ""it destroyed all my expectations"".  Thus, the creators of the stuff are indirectly positioned as only semi-mortal figures, working ""magic"" with our hearts and souls-- or worse, the cult of celebrity claims their bodies entirely, elevating what was probably a humbling creative experience into the work of gods.  And while that pays excellent tribute to the mysticism of inspiration, it probably distances the artists from the rest of the pack (i.e., us) more than necessary.  <name>Bob Drake</name> plays distant music (literally, from the south of France), but apparently takes no pleasure in abstractions that might, in the hands of a lesser musician, quickly alienate an audience.  An abashed fan of olde-thyme pompasaurs like Yes and Uriah Heep, he rarely shies away from extroverted splashes of sound, be they cacophonous guitar solos or wailing vocal harmonies.  Yet, these moments seem less like flashes-in-the-pan than merely broader strokes on his palette.  In fact, where you might expect his songs to erupt into classical arcana, his underlying forms appear to be closer to traditional folk, albeit murder ballads and nursery tale night beasts.  It's almost as if <name>Drake</name>'s relentless attention to detail and humility, even when obscured by a few layers of feedback, keeps whatever pretensions he has in check. 13 Songs and a Thing is <name>Drake</name>'s fifth solo record, and continues in a similarly eclectic vein as last year's excellent <neg>The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors</neg>.  However, where that album was a song-cycle of short stories, 13 Songs doesn't have a running narrative to tie it together.  Fans of his work shouldn't be disappointed, though, as per usual, there is no mistaking his sound.  The opener ""Chase"", written by <name>Dominic Frontiere</name> (theme composer for the 60s horror show The Outer Limits) and arranged by <name>Drake</name>, would actually fit well on the last album, as its frenzied, claustrophobic terror is hammered home via an aggressive acoustic guitar jag and nervous violin.  It's a junk symphony that would make as much sense coming from <name>Tom Waits</name> as <name>Danny Elfman</name>.  Similarly, ""Ten for a Dime"" uses intricate guitar figures and bowed double bass to create an atmosphere not far from an <name>Alfred Hitchcock</name> soundtrack, yet <name>Drake</name>'s later juxtaposition of strange bluegrass riffs and Mellotron-soaked goth place it in a realm of his own design.  Acoustic textures lend understated warmth to most of this music, as do the omnipresent trad-American folk references.  The fractured waltz ""In Case the Insulator Fails"" could almost be an outtake from O Brother, Where Art Thou were it not for the offhandedly dissonant asides from violin and electric guitar.  It leads into the brief ""Griffin"", which is musically akin to <name>Bela Bartok</name>'s take on The Beatles' ""I've Just Seen a Face"", but detailing <name>Drake</name>'s erotic fascination with a museum statue places it well outside either folk-pop or modern classical music.  The most striking moments on 13 Songs come when comparisons are much harder to make.  ""And the Sun"" is a gorgeous piece featuring distant classical piano and a barely audible gauze of ambient noise, punctuated by random bursts of radio static.  It's an almost perfect realization of almost forgotten mental imagery, as if years of life and music have obscured the original beauty of the piano music-- and in fact, <name>Drake</name> notes that part of the piece was recorded in the early 80s.  Guest vocalist <name>Dick Verdult</name> carries both ""<neg>Foam I</neg>"" and ""Rtuuf"" with throaty Spanish, and lends the former tune elegance not far removed from <name>Paul Simon</name>'s buoyant work on Graceland.  Of course, <name>Drake</name> throws in a cavernous echo and expansive, almost overburdened arrangement of deep bass and primal, thudding percussion to knock it off center.  And then there's ""<neg>Building with Bones</neg>"", aka ""<neg>A Thing</neg>"": an epic backbreaker that sounds pretty close to the ground beneath my house caving in for about 13 straight minutes.  Despite repeated demonstrations of idiosyncrasy and an apparent dedication to turning left when a right is expected, 13 Songs is hardly an exclusive experience.  I'd argue that <name>Drake</name> might even be approaching a hybrid of folk and avant-garde music that includes the most engaging characteristics of both without ever really betraying one for the other.  Maybe that leaves him alone in music circles (though I might make similar claims for the aforementioned <name>Simon</name> and <name>Waits</name>), but should be all the easier to pick his brand of noise from a crowd for listeners.  Sometimes it doesn't pay to look for links to the outside world, and his tunes are inviting enough that it may never occur to you to do so anyway."14515	1132	"Too often in the (still) geeky-white-kid-dominated indie world, rhythm gets cast aside as a marginal sidekick to ambitions such as writing the perfect melody or scoring an NME-abetted college radio chart-topper.  Dancepunk tried valiantly to remedy this but, in a way, only made things worse: Musicians who seemed to have little or no interest in a groove took a crash course in ESG and sought to control rhythm's basic tenets because it was the thing to do.  As a result, the image of the awkward white kid sloppily banging out a rigid disco beat on a shitty drumset is now more farcical than endearing, and the fun of records like <neg>The Rapture's Echoes</neg> has been overshadowed by <neg>pale imitators</neg>.  It's nice, then, that Codename: Dustsucker, built from the ground up on ""found drumming"" from ex-band member <name>Mark Simnett</name> and new tracks from Talk Talk's <name>Lee Harris</name>, thrives on and reveres rhythm rather than merely tinkering with or flat-out ignoring it. Dustsucker arrives a decade after <neg>Bark Psychosis</neg>' previous album, Hex, and the band's subsequent dissolution.  That 10-year hiatus may seem slight in a year in which <name>Brian Wilson</name> fans were relieved of their 37-year wait for Smile but, like the former <neg>Beach Boy</neg>, <neg>Bark Psychosis</neg> deliver. And, like Hex, Dustsucker sounds utterly unique, eschewing even the broadest classification.  This album is percussion-centric, and that's to say nothing of the temperance and agility of the drummers' playing.  It's also an album smitten with texture, space, and silence, a seamless blend of acoustic instrumentation and electronic processing on which its piecemeal compositions generate massive momentum within predominantly slothful tempos.  On ""Shapeshifting"", one can hear a constant push-and-pull between the acoustic and electronic elements, as plaintive strummed guitar nudges against a stiff drumbeat with metallic, Gamelan-like flourishes.  The record is also filled with huge, billowing clouds of resonance, which occasionally inundate its tracks in a morass of sustained sounds. ""400 Winters"" lingers and lingers, drawn out by massive amounts of reverb, plenty of held notes, and an ethereal underpinning of backward-looped vibraphone.  Though melancholic, the song is ultimately too hopeful to be dragged down and it's easier to bask in its hazy formlessness than moan about its lack of variation.  But while ""400 Winters"" manages to stay afloat, some tracks suffer from lethargy.  ""Inqb8tr"" is opulently adorned in multiple layers of effects and textures, but is too congested to endure its eight-minute runtime.  But even when Dustsucker's songwriting falters, the percussion is distinct, lending direction to the record's stacked orchestration.  ""Reserve Shot Gunman"" emerges from directionless darkness with a propulsive, vaguely Latin groove.  A mercurial bassline gradually annexes notes until finding a melody that, in lieu of vocals, provides the track both a face and a backbone.  ""From What Is Said to When It's Read"" incorporates huge, tympanic tom sounds as a kind of melodic element, while ""Shapeshifting"" rides an unflinching vamp through a two-minute coda that features no melody, only noisome sound effects and drums. Dustsucker may be languorous and dense enough to put off those who are on edge, but even when the album grinds to a halt under its excessive weight the scenery is beatific.  And what the songs lack in structural certainty or melodic eloquence they usually make up for in the remarkable depth and vibrancy of their textures.  Considering the band's 10-year layoff, it's a somewhat understated return-- and one painted in broad strokes.  But the album's unerring intimacy implores closer looks.  In 2004, the fact that this record exists at all is significant, and fans of Hex should find plenty to like under its moody lightning."18383	287	"I got a heart so big it could crush this town.  Really, I'm not just swiping a <name>Tom Petty</name> lyric for shits and giggles.  My heart is huge, knocking off them block rocking beats like it was a couple of ugly English guys with a sampler.  Speaking of which... techno music.  Back in the day, there was <neg>Meat Beat Manifesto</neg>.  Don't get me wrong-- there still is a <neg>Meat Beat Manifesto</neg>, but in the early '90s it was the only sort of techno I could wrap my hands around.  <neg>Storm the Studio</neg> and <neg>99%</neg> are sheer works of genius.  I rediscovered this last week when I took a little jaunt to Los Angeles.  There I sat in front of the stereo, stoned to the bone and kicking ass on ""Tekken 3.""  Hard beats, so thick and bloated that a set of octuplets could come spilling out at any moment.  Have you heard these albums?  If not, snatch them up. They're the blueprint for all of the rigid, noisy dance music of the <neg>early '90s</neg>.  Meanwhile, here in the late '90s, techno has taken a different track.  Today's techno artists couldn't give a shit about anything under <neg>120 BPM</neg>.  Everything's too fast to dance to.  Sorry if it dates me, but it's true.  I don't want to hit a dance floor and wiggle back and forth at <neg>900 BPM</neg> to jungle music.  <name>Arling</name> and <name>Cameron</name>'s latest in a string of American releases, All-In, has a handful of tracks like this but dancing doesn't seem to be the motive.  Even on the track ""We Love Dancing,"" the motive is less KMFDM and more on the jokey Aphex Twin tip. Remember ""Milkman"" from Aphex's <name>Richard D. James</name> Album?  Who didn't bust a gut during the crazy ""I would like some milk from the milkman's wife's tits"" chorus?  Deaf people, of course.  Everybody else got the joke. ""We Love Dancing"" is a hyperactive number built around a sample of giggling four- year- olds singing the title and yelling ""Yaaaaaaaay!""  The joke is later resurrected on the Kraftwerk parody ""We Love to Rock"" and the spacy ""<neg>We Love Dub</neg>.""  I guess what I'm trying to say is that All-In is, yet isn't, a techno album.  ""<neg>Speeding Down the Highway</neg>-- <neg>Fastest Girl Around</neg>"" is a nice merging of Buffalo Daughter and Stereolab without succumbing to the godawful hijinx of the Cardigans.  ""But What About the Boys"" is a future gay club classic, and I say that with hope that future gay club classics won't entail <neg>Ace of Base</neg> or <neg>Human League</neg>.  ""Get It On"" rubs itself all over shag carpeted bass lines before surrendering to jagged beats and Hammond organ.  The sprightly fun of ""Groovy"" will have you tapping your foot and whistling in no time flat.  Can you dance to it?  Ask a dancer. I like music, and when you get right down to it, I like All-In."16770	6881	"I really don't want to compare <name>Nate Ruth</name> to <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg>, but hey, what can you do?  As obvious as the reference seems, he doesn't give me much choice. Not that <name>Ruth</name>'s music really sounds like the work of <name>Kev Shields</name>, but the aesthetic used to construct the songs is remarkably close to the one that created Loveless.  See, <name>Ruth</name>'s basic approach on <neg>Whatever It Means</neg> seems to be to start with a simple vocal melody, and then layer sheets of controlled guitar noise on top, creating an intensely dense yet penetrable texture.  This concentrated squall is propelled by programmed beats that just might be somewhat danceable if they weren't carrying the weight of such a deep roar.  <name>Ruth</name> deviates from this formula as the album reaches its midpoint, lifting the fog for some more directly accessible numbers, but for the first few tracks, this is what we get.  And it's a wonderful thing.  The third time I listened to <neg>Whatever It Meant</neg>, I remember distinctly saying out loud, to an empty room, ""Man, this album is fucking weird.""  What I hadn't yet realized was how insidiously memorable it is.  The more I listen to it, the deeper it buries itself in my mind, taking hold of a different cerebral region with each spin.  The first four songs pour from the speakers like digital molasses.  ""End Up,"" for example, sounds like it wanted to be a normal song at one point, but the vocals and trotting percussion wind up trees in a forest of sound.  ""<neg>How Truly Great You Are</neg>"" is a drumless, eerie thicket of guitar and quietly soulful singing.  Lyrically, it's an excellent, sarcastic devotional to a gigantic ego and all the people that bow to it; musically, it's a subtle and imaginative offering that neatly toes the line between ambient comfort and pop accessibility. <neg>Whatever It Meant</neg> reaches a sort of turning point after that song, moving several lateral steps into some sort of cabaret for the clinically depressed with ""Oversimplifying."" ""Lots of newfound free time I have/ Oughta teach a course in being sad/ And the clouds that hover overhead get taken for granted,"" sings <name>Ruth</name> over not much more than a bass and some strategically placed effects.  ""<neg>To Forget</neg>"" and ""Kindly"" reverse the mixing principles of the first four songs, sweeping the noise-addled guitar parts behind the vocals and allowing the mixture of drum machine grooves and live percussion to flow more freely.  ""Kindly"" almost reminds me of some of Porcupine Tree's best material, with its understated vocals and creeping arrangement. <name>Ruth</name> sits down at the piano for ""Every Summer,"" which is about as straightforward as pop music gets: singer and accompaniment, with some soft-toned synth countermelodies and xylophone to spruce up the edges.  The album's final third dives back into noisy territory, though it feels somewhat removed from the first four tracks during which the guitars are frequently so overdriven that the strumming and harmony becomes somewhat ambiguous.  ""<neg>Code Words</neg>"" is almost reminiscent of the shoegazer punk of Italian Flag-era Prolapse, minus the male/female vocal attack of that band.  The transition is smooth, though, as <name>Ruth</name> seems to have had sequencing in mind when making the album.  The song opens with a very odd repeated piano phrase that immediately throws you off the trail of whatever key the song might be in, something that's not aided by the distorted everything that comes in shortly afterward.  ""Thanks Just the Same"" is a gorgeous ballad filled with floating piano figures, dejected vocals, and yep, tons more distortion.  The guitar loses prominence as the song progresses, setting up the off-kilter ""Nothing Can Make Me Feel Better,"" which opens relatively clean over some drunken piano before the static undertow and frantically busy drum program cut in. The album closes with ""It's Been Worth the Wait,"" and you're likely to agree, because it's the most majestic track on the album, weaving synth and distorted guitar (of course) into a quilt of pure sound and bringing the album full circle to the sound that opens it.  One thing I love to do with records that feel this complete is try to divide them into logical, equal sections, and I find that it's usually possible on some level.  Whatever It Meant follows what I've found to be a broad trend of breaking works into thirds to make them more digestible.  You've got the noisy/melodic first-third, the relatively clean, more sonically varied second-third, and the noisy/melodic/this-time-with-piano final third, complete with a nod back to the beginning at the end.  It sounds simple, but it's this kind of logical flow that makes this album a breeze to listen to, despite its often challenging mix. Whatever It Meant is an intriguing solo debut for an artist who's obviously not afraid to try something different.  Aside from his sonic adventurousness, though, he's also got an innate pop sense to balance it with, and that's what really makes it work.  This album is a world of sound, and it's got the hooks to drag you right into it.  Give it a try."16407	977	"Despite the plural name and a short list of session players, The Bruces begin and end with one <name>Alex McManus</name>, a seasoned veteran of the indie scene who has played with <neg>Empire State</neg>, Lambchop, <name>Vic Chesnutt</name>, and <neg>Bright Eyes</neg>. <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> isn't his debut, but it might as well be: several years ago, he pressed a mere 500 copies of his first record, <neg>Hialeah Pink</neg>. He's shown ironclad reluctance to put out his own music, preferring the side of someone else's stage to his own spotlight, so it comes as a welcome surprise to his tiny coterie of fans to find that he's released an album one can own without a prerequisite pilgrimage to Atlanta's used record shops.  Anyone who hears <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> is more than likely hearing <neg>The Bruces</neg> for the first time, and it's a fine introduction. Though he dips deep into the well of American roots music for inspiration, <name>McManus</name> does more than simply rehash folk and blues tunes with a rock 'n' roll beat. These songs are rarely louder than <name>Robert Johnson</name>, and always softer than Howlin' Wolf, which is a refreshing change from the pickpockets who believe the blues can't be played or sung too hard.  That said, The War of <neg>the Bruces</neg> isn't really a roots record; <name>McManus</name> re-envisions his source material like a less theatrical <name>Tom Waits</name>, replacing standard twelve-bar structures with an unpredictable-- and fascinating-- sense of drift, allowing for almost inexhaustible possibilities.  Instruments don't come in at a designated times, instead floating in and out unceremoniously. In the other hand, this might come off as irritating freeform, the musings of a jam band, even while <name>McManus</name>' overarching ideals nudge songs forward surely as <name>Mark Twain</name> guided <name>Huck</name> and <name>Jim</name> down the Mississippi.  Furthering this analogy, The War of the Bruces is a taut, spontaneous adventure, rather than some labored, self-conscious contrivance.  Nowhere is this better represented than its final stretch, where each song flows unnoticed into the next, with ominous noise rising up to threaten the strained tranquility of a seamless suite. Even without his other accomplishments, this is exhilarating stuff, a promising younger brother of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Yet, alluring as it may be, <neg>The War of the Bruces</neg> certainly won't attain the dizzying critical popularity of Wilco's recent triumph, for a few regrettable reasons. First, <name>McManus</name>' voice sometimes borders on a warble, wavering too much for popular tastes. His lyrics are also spotty, and occasionally-- but very noticeably-- transpose vulgarity and sincerity. Lastly-- and this is an injustice-- the album's sparse, unstructured feel will turn off listeners who demand overt song structures. The running order raises that hurdle higher, sequencing the album's least effective experiments before its last-lap sprint to glory.  Still, for those with an open mind and a modicum of patience, there's much to love about this mysterious record."12262	9296	"Boom or ruin. The meaning of ""post-war"" changes depending on whether or not your side won. The term is likely to keep its basically positive connotation in the U.S. at least until everyone who remembers the late-1940s is dead. I'm unsure what war <name>M. Ward</name> is referring to in the title of his fifth album, or even if he had a specific war in mind, but a time of active war seems like an odd time to consider the sentiment. The reality of human nature also means that every post-war is also a pre-war-- every generation spills blood sooner or later. The title track sheds a bit of light on where <name>Ward</name>'s mind is, and that's to say he's right about where he usually is. <name>Ward</name>'s post-war is internal, relational; it's adjusting to new realities, both pleasant and not. Backed with electric piano and shaker-- a sort of slow-motion r&b setting-- <name>Ward</name>'s endearingly creaky tenor softly draws the line between then and now: ""You say the money just ain't what it used to be/ Man how we used to tear apart this town/ Put a dollar into the machine and you'll remember how."" The humidity is so high in the arrangement that I swear my speakers got wet. That humidity comes and goes on Post-War, <name>Ward</name>'s first record with a full-time backing band. Having the band doesn't fundamentally change his approach, but it does boost the immediacy of some of his songs. The overall flow of the album is also much more focused than in the past, with 12 songs and very few transitional scraps and mood pieces. If those little bits of ephemera carried a large part of the charm load on his earlier albums, they're not missed very sorely here-- beautifully realized songs and great musicianship have a way of making up for something like that.  And these are some truly beautiful songs. Live strings spar with mellotron strings on ""Poison Cup"", a gorgeous and intense love song that begins, ""One or two won't do/ 'Cause I want it all...I hope you know what I'm thinkin' of/ I want all of your love."" The song leaves <name>Ward</name>'s familiar intimacy behind for timpanis and grandeur, but he doesn't shed a drop of emotion in the transition. ""Requiem"" storms in with raw blues picking, and from there twists <name>Ward</name>'s most-visited theme-- loss-- into an unusually triumphant tribute to a man who ""stormed with his feet and clapped with his hands/ (And) summoned all of his joy when he laughed.""  ""In war he was a tiger/ And in peace he was a dove"" is just one of the dualities <name>Ward</name> gives his character in the kind of obituary anyone would love to have written about him.  <name>Ward</name> nearly equals the shear majesty of <neg>My Morning Jacket</neg>'s ""Golden"" on ""<neg>Chinese Translation</neg>"", which features MMJ's <name>Jim James</name> on backing vocals. The song's ""what do you do with the pieces of a broken heart"" refrain and acoustic/electric guitar duel hit home like hammers. The cover of <name>Daniel Johnston</name>'s ""To Go Home"", with <name>Neko Case</name> handling the harmonies, is amazing, musically reminiscent of Wilco at their Summerteeth/<neg>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</neg> peak. Not everything is so substantial. ""Magic Trick"" is essentially a quick joke about a girl whose only trick is disappearing, while ""Neptune's Net"" is a fun but inconsequential surf instrumental (strangely, it doesn't sound out of place).  Changing his approach has rewarded <name>M. Ward</name> pretty handsomely on <neg>Post-War</neg>. <neg>The Transfiguration of Vincent</neg> is still my favorite <name>Ward</name> album by a hair, but this one isn't going far from my player for long. <neg>Post-War</neg> isn't perfect, but it's all the more listenable for that fact. "1444	21222	"<name>Ryan Lee West</name> felt moved to a brief outburst back in August. The Leicester-born, London-based producer who makes music as <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> tweeted in protest of the ongoing boom of deep house, asking artists to quit contributing to the genre, currently in vogue. ""There's probably enough to last us till 2089,"" he wrote.<name>West</name>'s ire makes sense, if only because the music he makes as <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> feels diametrically opposed to the luxuriant, lengthy bath evoked by deep house. <name>West</name> is a musical engineer in the mold of luminaries like <neg>Aphex Twin</neg> and relative newcomers like <name>Dave Harrington</name>, and the soundscapes he's constructed on his third LP, Howl, are spiky and imposing, too solid to sink into. The music is always shifting, so it's impossible to lose track of time while listening. You're always aware that any given composition is morphing, is in flux. Reams of electronic producers luxuriate in the safety of creating a comfortable atmosphere. But Howl is impossible to ignore, and hard to forget.That's partly because <name>West</name> so often feels comfortable disrupting his own patterns. ""Afterglow"" seems as if it's going to build on an early synth loop, but what at first seems like the track's foundation turns out to be its foyer: halfway in, and suddenly we're in an entirely new room, one that's louder, brighter, more expansive. Our understanding of his pieces broadens as they move through time, so that once they're nearly over we apprehend the entire structure as if by a drone camera hovering above.That vivid view is studded with allusions: the title track makes extraordinary reference to trains and tunnels, and at times the dusky track ""Pre"" recalls the snaking sounds of a film projector. <name>West</name> has said that he's a fan of ""sloppy things and rough things happening in music,"" but even the little blips and isotopes here feel as if they've been cast in concrete, accidents granted purpose. In contrast to the last two <neg>Rival Consoles</neg> LPs, <neg>Howl was</neg> largely forged from hardware (as opposed to digital technology), and the record's analogue origins would be obvious even if you knew nothing about its genesis.<name>West</name> is a labelmate of <name>Nils Frahm</name> and, this year alone, has toured with <name>Clark</name> and <neg>Nosaj Thing</neg>. He shares with all three the instincts of a classical composer. Howl's closer, ""Looming"", is a six-and-a-half-minute mini-epic that reflects the depth of emotion that West says he poured into Howl. But the catharsis it induces comes as much from the musician's restraint and sense of composure as anything else. What isn't there is as important as what is.<name>West</name>'s grumbling about deep house might make him seem like a dinosaur. But he doesn't seem bothered by its existence; he's complaining about a surplus, and, like a true progressive, his momentary gripe stands as mere prelude to more concerted action. His music—rocky, spiky, warm, titanic—drives us to re-evaluate whether referring to someone as a dinosaur might not be quite as pejorative as we thought."8554	13502	"What a bizarrely tardy project, this remix comp. The original 45:33, <name>James Murphy</name>'s contribution to Nike's intermittent series of one-artist mixes designed for exercise, is edging up on being three years old. In Internet-era time, the DFA might as well have let these producers loose on original <name>Giorgio Moroder</name> demos.Not that 45:33 itself sounds dated, already owing so much to classic disco and techno. Like all LCD releases, 45:33 was <name>Murphy</name> acting as curator of his local dance music historical society, while thrillingly (at its best) filtering it through his own mix of mordancy and guarded euphoria. Lest we forget, it contained an embryonic version of LCD's ""Someone Great"", sans vocals, making it more or less the debut of <name>Murphy</name>'s more tender side, something that bloomed gorgeously on the following year's <neg>Sound of Silver</neg>.But remix comps are generally rush-to-market affairs crassly designed to capitalize on a hot release by extending its commercial value for a few more months. The presumably long gestation time of <neg>45:33 Remixes</neg> might make you think we're getting something really special, something that took time to get just right. In reality, not so much. 45:33 Remixes is more-or-less superfluous, the depressingly common fate of the bulk of remix comps. Of the eight remixers, no less than five fix on the exact same section of the original 45:33, which starts around 18 minutes in and dissolves into brass gurgles 10 minutes later. Given that the remixers had 45 minutes worth of music to rebuild from the ground up, leaning on the most traditionally ""disco"" section of 45:33, complete with horns and diva, and leaving it mostly intact feels like a failure of nerve and/or imagination.Brooklyn duo Runaway add watery keyboard stabs that blow arrhythmically against the main beat, as if they were playing an <name>Arthur Russell</name> demo on top of the original. Akwardly. Prince Language throws on some dub wobble, but you've got to A/B the two versions closely to even gauge what he's added or subtracted, the ""playing with the levels"" school of remixing at its blandest.And <name>Theo Parrish</name>, who you'd assume could at least be relied on to add some soul-funk grit to the proceedings, comes momentarily correct with boogie bass and extra percussion. But for a guy who could squeeze so much emotion out of the minimal materials of the ruthlessly raw, repetitive ""Ugly Edits"" series, <name>Parrish</name>'s remix blands out over its seven-plus minutes, despite being 10 times more overstuffed. Hey, another <name>Walter Gibbons</name>-aping breakdown with call-and-response drums reverbed to hell and back. It might not seem so deadeningly familiar if it rivaled Gibbons' own best work.Of the four, only <name>Riley Reinhold</name> does anything remotely interesting with that 10-minute slab of downtown-NYC-in-the-1970s retro. His big innovation is replacing the 4/4 disco swish with a rigid electro-breakbeat shuffle. Even given how generic and/or tentative the other three remixes sound, you can't exactly call <name>Reinhold</name>'s remix revelatory.That leaves four remixers to try and make up for the creativity deficit. And they're good, though not one wows enough to obviate the cost of the whole collection. <name>Prins Thomas</name> takes the original's most feathery section, the cascade of Tangerine Dream-ish synths and wordless vocals that make up the long outro, and turns in pop ambient by adding a micro-syncopated pulse. <neg>Trus'Me</neg>'s electro is the set's most playful and unexpected track, especially when it closes with twinkling mallets that could be kissing cousin to the kind you used to get on Tortoise or <name>Nobukazu Takemura</name> records.Padded Cell's the only remixer who thought, ""Hey, maybe I can patch different sections of the original together to make something that extends the vibe, rather than adding congas and calling it a day."" (A seriously missed opportunity on everyone else's part.) He takes the outro coos that also beguiled <name>Thomas</name> and adds the lugubrious piano house that serves as the original's warmup. And surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly together, each adding to the other's preexisting sad dreaminess for the best remix here.What 45:33 Remixes lacks most is personality, something even LCD's experimental one-offs (like the original 45:33) reliably offer. See: Pilooski's deep house pastiche. Yes, it sounds nothing like the original. It just sounds like... a deep house pastiche. It's not just that the remixes dilute <name>Murphy</name>'s inimitable presence in his own music; 45:33 was mostly vocal-free to begin with. It's that the remixers don't add much of themselves to compensate, preferring to subtly tweak sections of the original to make them more dancefloor friendly or shove them through familiar schtick.That's the charitable view, at least. A sadder take might be that the artists were just cashing a much-needed check, whether it was cut three weeks or three years after 45:33 hit iTunes. Or worse, they blanched at the freedom to dismantle <name>Murphy</name>'s creation to satisfy their own idiosyncratic wants, their hesitancy all the more strange considering that LCD's whole M.O., what makes the band more than a sterile realization of the gag at the heart of ""<neg>Losing My Edge</neg>"", is <name>Murphy</name>'s willingness to bend or break history to make room for himself."14983	3019	"True experimentalists never die, they just alienate all their friends by refusing to settle into a     comfortable rut.  German legends Faust, represented on this collaboration with <neg>New Jersey</neg> hip-hop     mavericks <neg>Dälek</neg> as <name>Werner ""Zappi"" Diermaier</name>, <name>Hans Joachim Irmler</name>, <name>Steven W. Lobdel</name>, <name>Lars Paukstaff</name> and     <name>Michael Stoll</name>, have fashioned a pretty unbelievable catalog of tunes from a stubborn insistence on     constant movement.  Granted, they haven't always moved at the same breathless pace they did in the     early 70s, but like their krautrocking peers in Can, Faust have proved to be among the most reliably     forward-thinking musicians of their generation.Small surprise, then, to hear their glorious, droned-out take on hip-hop with Dälek.  <neg>Derbe Respect, Alder</neg> (or ""crude respect, elder"") hardly sounds like any hip-hop I've heard; more like a druggy,     clamorous collage of industrial noise and feedback, with a stray loop every now and then.  Rather than     simply using Faust as their backing band, the trio of Dälek (<name>Will Brooks</name>), producer Oktopus (<name>Alap Momin</name>)     and turntablist Still (<name>Hsi-Chang Lin</name>) attack fragments and panic-ridden, acid-damaged jams as raw     source material, and opt to spout <neg>Last Poets</neg>-style free form verse over the more unhinged moments.  And     like <neg>The Last Poets</neg>, <neg>Dälek</neg>'s agenda seems politically charged, as titles like ""<neg>Bullets Need Violence</neg>""     indicate.  Still, pure sound rules this collaboration, and they produce an intimidating, blunt jab     indeed.Most of the music on <neg>Derbe Respect, Alder</neg> was recorded in 2002 and 2003 by Faust, then manipulated     by Dälek-- though the final (listed) track ""<neg>T-Electronique</neg>"" was taken from Faust's 1999 album Ravvivando.     I had first heard the track on the last Wire Tapper compilation, and it is, by some measure, the     most straightforward piece on the album.  Its bass-heavy, loping drum loop flails like cold, machine-generated     funk, but the heavenly organ clusters overhead are pristine and sweet, and could only have come from Germany.     <name>Brooks</name> references ""filthy tongues slowly severed"" and ""the constant threat that we easily forget,"" and aligns     himself perfectly with the claustrophobic paranoia of the track.  This version of ""T-Electronique"" should     be a godsend to anyone into hypnotic drone-funk.""<neg>Imagine What We Started</neg>"" begins the album with cold wind and deep, unidentifiable bass tones, like stepping     into an endless underground tunnel and realizing all the fleeting noises behind and above aren't just products     of your ketamine buzz.  When the drums hit, all hell breaks loose: Oktopus and Still drench the loop with     delay so that Diermaier's drums sound like the work of three men hammering out polyrhythms best suited for     inducing motion sickness and hearing loss, yet it's fascinating in its disorientating force (which is     one way to describe my feeling for the album in general).  ""Hungry for Now"" introduces <name>Brooks</name>' voice for     the first time on the album, warning, ""If I have not met your expectations, try to conceive my frustrations     with an earthly tongue,"" over ever-offcenter drum/bass vamping from <name>Diermaier</name> and <name>Stoll</name>, while <name>Lobdell</name>'s     guitar stains all available space with guitar drone and feedback approaching white noise.  See also the     second half of ""<neg>Dead Lies</neg>"" and grotesque motorik of ""<neg>Collected Twighlight</neg>"" for more apocalyptic dream-shriek.Derbe Respect, Alder is a tough record to size up: On one hand, its middle third can get so dense,     so unrelentingly bleak that it takes a particularly receptive thrillseeker to make it through unscathed;     on the other, its best moments (for example, the first and last tracks, not counting the brief hidden track)     are some of the best music I've heard this year, and their payoffs are reason enough to let the undertow     swallow you whole.  Regardless, Faust and <neg>Dälek</neg> demonstrate the capabilities of potent, creative minds and     insistent forging ahead of born experimentalists.  If that means a few people are left behind, all the     better to take in the hardcore bliss on your own."1518	21166	"As a solo rapper, <name>Big Boi</name> has been pushing steadily against the old preconception that he was the less-daring half of Outkast. On all three of his solo albums—Speakerboxxx counts— he happily explored his quirks, establishing himself as someone more than just <name>Andre 3000</name>'s more stolid counterpart. With <neg>Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty</neg>,  he pulled off an incredible, boisterously funky reintroduction. <neg>Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors</neg> paired him with Wavves, <neg>Little Dragon</neg> and Phantogram among others, and if the results were mixed, it was further evidence of <name>Antwan Patton</name>'s voracious ear.Vicious Lies paved the way for this full Phantogram collaboration. The indie-pop duo featured on three of the songs on Vicious, but on Big Grams they hit a bit more of a stride. This isn't a <name>Big Boi</name>-on-Phantogram beats project, and Phantogram's <name>Sarah Barthel</name> is nearly as central as the OutKast rapper as a lead vocalist. The two trade spots as lead vocalists playfully and <name>Barthel</name>'s hooks are integral throughout. <name>Barthel</name> tries some rapping, and the results aren't actively embarrassing. ""<neg>Run for Your Life</neg>"", the lead track, is sparse and spacey, and the synth sounds lifted from <name>Stevie Wonder</name>'s Moog on ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"". <name>Big Boi</name>'s raps aren't deep on <neg>Big Grams</neg>, but they are captivating: His strategically fluttering drawl, doled out in pitter-patter bursts, is a trademark as recognizable as it is versatile. On ""<neg>Fell in the Sun</neg>"" he punches quickly with a staccato: ""I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back / I bust the sunroof open, beams hit the Braves cap.""  This track, the lead single, is the obvious standout, and it's here that the collaboration clicks fully. Phantogram's <name>Josh Carter</name> builds up a throbbing wall of synths atop a snappy drum loop, and like elsewhere, horn stabs punctuates: proof, perhaps, that everything <name>Big Boi</name> does deserves a little funk. ""Put It On Her"" is one of two tracks on the outing not produced by <name>Carter</name>, and it's certainly the better and more natural of them. (That soulful pump fake of an intro turns out to be a subtle <neg>9th Wonder</neg> calling card.) The Skrillex-featuring ""<neg>Drum Machine</neg>"", however, sticks out like a sore thumb and bogs down the end of the album. For a record that's so smoothly collaborative elsewhere, ""<neg>Drum Machine</neg>"" sounds contrived and clunky. Luckily it is tacked on the end, making it entirely skippable.The <neg>Run the Jewels</neg> feature on ""Born to Shine"" fares better, and not just because of <name>Big Boi</name>'s pivotal role in <name>Killer Mike</name>'s career. <name>Mike</name>'s verse steals the show—""Ric Flair'in' / Long fur coat wearin' / Rolex rockin' / Silk shirt wearin'""—while <name>Big Boi</name> happily takes a backseat. This may be a hallmark of <name>Patton</name>'s career:  He's continually building up evidence that he doesn't care so much about being the lead as he is interested in being in the middle of something new and different. Given Atlanta's persistent vitality as a hotbed for innovative hip-hop, it's nice to know that one of the city's elder statesmen is off doing his own thing, carving out another little path for himself long after he helped pave the main road."3209	19156	"When it comes to fucking around, <neg>Duck Sauce</neg> are not fucking around. <name>Armand Van Helden</name> and A-Trak have spent a large part of this decade acting as big-box dance music's merry pranksters, following their clown-nosed muses to the most illogically comical endpoints. In their music videos, the duo have acted as whistle-prone barbers, drank each other's milkshakes, and become literal dickheads; after bringing their bomber jacket-befitted inflatable mascot to <neg>New York City's Governor's Ball</neg> festival in 2012, they set their creation floating down the <neg>East River</neg> during the following year's installment of the festival—just for laughs.While introducing Duck Sauce's loopy entry in BBC's Essential Mix series, <name>Armand Van Helden</name> described the originals-heavy portion of the two-hour mix as ""songs we tried shopping to <name>George Michael</name>, <name>Celine Dion</name>, <name>Billy Joel</name>, and were all declined""; loaded with stoner-friendly sampledelia, the end result resembled something the Avalanches would've whipped up if they binged on breakfast burritos and after-hours basic cable.""There’s nothing serious about Duck Sauce—nothing,"" said A-Trak (real name <name>Alain Macklovitch</name>) when I interviewed him and <name>Van Helden</name> earlier this year. The project has indeed come across as a lackadaisical concern for the two veteran producers, releasing roughly a single a year over the past six years and devoting the rest of their shared effort to crowd-pleasing live performances on the festival circuit. The pair liken their biggest hit to date, the giddily repetitive ""<neg>Barbra Streisand</neg>"", to the Champs' ""<neg>Tequila Song</neg>""—""Just a riff and a word""—and to this point Duck Sauce have come across as a novelty concern, a singles project that excels at penetrating the zeitgeist.Which is fine; dance music thrives as a singles-focused culture, and even with the current micro-boom in artist-focused albums as a byproduct of the EDM money pit, smart money was not on the guys with the inflatable duck releasing a satisfying full-length. So the punchline to Duck Sauce's greatest prank yet is that they've gone ahead and done exactly that. Quack, Duck Sauce's proper debut, is reverential to the music of <neg>A-Trak</neg> and <name>Van Helden</name>'s past—disco's ecstatic glide, house music's hedonistic heartbeat, the good-natured irreverence of classic hip-hop—while sounding totally refreshing amongst its contemporaries. The closest thing here to what some would refer to as ""EDM"" is the squeaky Dutch house of ""It's You"", which rests its central melody on, of all things, a sped-up sample of a goddamn doo-wop song.If Daft Punk's Random Access Memories found the robots paying tribute to the music that shaped their lives, then Quack is <neg>Duck Sauce</neg> paying tribute to <neg>Daft Punk</neg> themselves, along with other French Touch luminaries like <name>Alan Braxe</name>, <name>Fred Falke</name>, and <name>Etienne de Crécy</name>. A-Trak and <name>Van Helden</name> liberally apply the glowing synths and filter-heavy textures of those Gallic auteurs throughout Quack, the entire thing brushed with the type of stupid-smart goofiness not seen since <name>Fatboy Slim</name>'s big-beat heyday. Bemoan festival-ready dance music as you wish, but the genre's greatest malady in 2014 is that many of its practitioners sound like they're trying too hard to have fun; Duck Sauce bring the party without breaking a sweat.Expertly playing to its creators' strengths—<name>Van Helden</name>'s ability to hardwire hip-hop breaks and house motifs, A-Trak's turntablist skill and crate-digging know-how—Quack operates at one intense speed and never lets up, from the heavy thump that kicks open ""<neg>Chariots of the Gods</neg>"" to ""<neg>Time Waits for No-One</neg>""'s stadium-minded '80s rock fixations. Subtlety is non-existent. The secret to Quack's success, then, is how loud it isn't: the record is mastered with finesse, an impressive studio sheen that wraps even the most hard-hitting of A-Trak and <name>Van Helden</name>'s creations in a down comforter. Disco-pop auteurs Chromeo pitch in on various tasks throughout the album—vocalist <name>Dave Macklovitch</name>, brother of <name>Alain</name>, sings lead on ""Everyone"" under the goofball alias Teddy Toothpick—and Quack frequently bears the type of big-money studio wizardry that the perpetually underestimated Chromeo are known for.At 54 minutes long, Quack isn't completely user-friendly as a front-to-back listening experience (shave two minutes off of every song and you'd have a tighter album that nonetheless would lose its functionality as a collection of DJ tools) but <neg>A-Trak</neg> and <name>Van Helden</name> deploy a few tricks to avoid inducing listener fatigue. Once or twice, they veer close to repetition for repetition's sake—the vocal drops and cyclical strings of ""Charlie Chazz & Rappin Ralph"" wear out their welcome halfway into the tune's five-minute length—but elsewhere they exhibit an impressive sense of patience. Leaning hard on samples from THP Orchestra's ""Good to Me"", the hook on ""<neg>Goody Two Shoes</neg>"" is almost impossibly indulgent to the point where it risks inducing diabetic shock; Duck Sauce know this, tempering the song's initial burst with a placid midsection of hand drums and lazer synths before bringing back the chorus in a way that triggers an intoxicating release. Even ""Barbra Streisand"", placed in the midst of Quack's world-beating final third, ebbs and flows with added flourishes (check the steel drum-sounding tones less than a minute in) to avoid reaching peak monotonousness.The other ace up Quack's sleeve is its skits. I know, I know—skits on albums are rarely funny, and their success more often than not relies on the listener's sense of humor, and everyone's definition of what's ""funny"" is as specific as snowflake architecture. Regardless, A-Trak and <name>Van Helden</name>, along with a cast of wiseguys that range from viral comedian the <neg>Fat Jew</neg> to <neg>Lord Sear</neg> from radio DJs Stretch & Bobbito's classic NYC hip-hop show, are pretty good at busting your gut, providing that your gut has a high tolerance for quacking noises and <neg>jokes about smelly underwear</neg>. They send up comparison-obsessed music nerds (""It’s sort of <name>Mel Gibson</name> meets ancient aliens""), <neg>Spanish-language</neg> radio shows, and <neg>Wu-Tang Clan</neg>'s classic torture skit from ""<neg>Method Man</neg>"", the latter in which a pitched-down <neg>A-Trak</neg> and <name>Van Helden</name> promise to ""Take you to a yoga ashram and shit, in fuckin’ Toronto."" A few skits on Quack (the <neg>Fat Jew</neg>'s prank phone call to a Chinese restaurant at the end of ""<neg>Ring Me</neg>"", the club-and-concert-calendar radio-promo spoof tacked on to ""NRG"") will undoubtedly trigger nostalgic reactions from anyone who's spent the majority of their lives in the tri-state area that surrounds <neg>New York City</neg>, and that's the point. <neg>A-Trak</neg> and <name>Van Helden</name> are both NYC denizens—the latter's legacy is practically cemented as one of many who shaped and added vibrancy to the city's dance culture—and even if they don't quite hit the heights of the A-Trak-name-checked influence of <neg>Beastie Boys</neg>' <neg>Paul's Boutique</neg> (how could they, let alone anyone?), they've created a hedonistic, piston-pumping album that bears as much relation to the urban hustle-and-bustle as it does to festival crowds' surging, ecstatic mindsets, a love letter to NYC that sounds good just about anywhere you're likely to hear it."3001	19408	Two opinions that could just about pass for facts upon the arrival of Klaxons’ third LP Love Frequency: 1. For many people, particularly in America, hearing the name "Klaxons" immediately opens a time warp back to the DayGlo nights of 2007, when terms like "nu-rave" and "blog-house" were spoken with straight faces and a lack of impunity. 2. It is 2014 now, and Klaxons have made a new album that, quite frankly, is pretty darn boring. However, the second fact is not a direct result of the first—this is correlation, not causation, and even if the terminology and fashion of "nu-rave" hasn’t aged well, its mission to present the 24 hour party plan of rave within a rock band context is as old as rave itself. Besides, Justice still packs 'em in, Simian Mobile Disco has become a bankable live act, and who knows, maybe something good will come of the New Young Pony Club rebranding. So Love Frequency's failures aren’t derived from a lack of currency, but rather a lack of identity.And that’s an odd issue to have with Klaxons, who put a lot of effort into establishing their previous guise, affixing the prolix lyrics and dubious mysticism of prog onto taut, glowstick-waving pop songs. It proved surprisingly malleable as they made a nu-rave-to-nu-metal transition from their electro-shocked debut to the <name>Ross Robinson</name>-produced Surfing the Void. It’s understandable they’d want to expand: after all, both <neg>Myths of the Near Future</neg> and <neg>Surfing the Void</neg> were enjoyable, but also top-heavy and ephemeral. Yet, while <name>Jamie Reynolds</name> alludes to a biblical vision quest on "<neg>Rhythm of Life</neg>", the Klaxons return from their 40 days and 40 nights in exile (or, more, accurately, four years) having taken on perhaps the single-most common form of non-American dance-rock hybrids: that of "Don’t Fight It, Feel It" shamanism. The song titles could pass for Madchester Successories—"<neg>Children of the Sun</neg>", "<neg>A New Reality</neg>", "<neg>Invisible Forces</neg>", "<neg>There is No Other Time</neg>". Just by scanning the tracklist, you know what to expect.Beyond the lack of imagination, <neg>Love Frequency</neg> is a baggy record regardless of which definition you prefer, whether it’s hearkening to "<neg>Loose Fit</neg>" or just the way their previously punchy hooks have been swapped out for paunchy beats. Synthesized drums bang with almost no variation for up to five minutes at a time, an introductory chorus explains the song’s title before shifting to a custodial, time-killing verse—and then it returns in time to remind you which song is "Show Me a Miracle" and which one is "Invisible Forces". It’s pointless to quote the lyrics at length, not because they’re ridiculous, but because they’re not ridiculous enough to generate the kind of conviction you need to pull this stuff off. Reynolds sings, "We’re the masters of distraction/ In a time of hyperaction" on "<neg>A New Reality</neg>", and it's unclear as to whether Klaxons want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, or whether they have any idea of what they’re trying to get across.Though a coterie of name producers were involved here—<neg>Chemical Brother</neg> <name>Tom Rowlands</name>, <name>James Murphy</name>, and <name>Erol Alkan</name>—their contributions are imperceptible here without the credits at hand. You could wager a guess by way of the songs' individual tempos and when the rhythms are cranked, <neg>Love Frequency</neg> is at least enjoyable in a functional way. And maybe functionality and depersonalization is the endgame. Klaxons aspire for elemental sentiments by using elemental imagery—qualities available to everyone and belonging to nobody, not the least of all Klaxons. The sawtoothed synths on opener "<neg>A New Reality</neg>" and the curious <neg>Earth, Wind & Fire</neg> harmonies throughout are brief allusions to the fact that you are listening to a Klaxons album and not any number of E-popping revivalists. Otherwise, there’s barely any trace of Klaxons on <neg>Love Frequency</neg>, and that's a strange complaint when the best songs here are the ones where the band come closest to disappearing completely, as on instrumental "<neg>Liquid Light</neg>" and the muted, distant shuffle of "<neg>The Dreamers</neg>".  Love Frequency isn’t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste Klaxons aren’t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore. At its worst, it’s the kind of hi-BPM, lo-IQ, alt-electro inanities that are responsible for filling the lineup of KROQ's <neg>Weenie Roast</neg> and will make you seriously reconsider your position on Coldplay and Avicii’s "<neg>A Sky Full of Stars</neg>".  For the most part, Klaxons spend most of their time in between, a frequency stuck between stations.274	22450	"Whether they’re parlaying their carefully cultivated mystique into pop stardom, or just outed by the press, camera-shy buzz acts generally don’t stay anonymous for long. But the masked members of GOAT have now made it to their third album without breaking character or being doxxed, which is no small achievement for a self-mythologizing entity in the age of oversharing. And even if they’re the only ones still recounting their incredulous origin story with a straight face (or a mask depicting a straight face), GOAT are still clinging the conceit, and to this day, interviews with the band put journalists in the awkward position of picking up the phone and asking to speak with somebody named Fuzzmaster.And yet in GOAT’s case, the ridiculous high-concept package ultimately reinforces the sincerity with which they approach their pan-cultural psych-funk fusion. Unlike fellow <neg>Swedes Ghost</neg>—whose campy black-mass theatrics seem like an awful lot of effort for what’s essentially melodic ’80s pop-metal—there’s very little ironic distance between GOAT’s image and execution. For them, costumery is not a means of drawing attention to themselves but deflecting it back onto their collectivist music. If GOAT aren’t actually a small-town sect reinterpreting the ritualistic sounds of the ancients (and are really just crate-diggers with robust internet connections and unlimited budgets for Afrobeat imports), what’s important is that they genuinely resemble one. On Requiem, that narrative becomes further entrenched, as GOAT lure us deeper into the woods for a communion ceremony under moonlight. This is their <neg>Zeppelin III</neg> move, a psychedelia rendered primarily with acoustic elements, pastoral brushes, and field-recording ambience. But even in stripped-down mode, GOAT are unrepentant maximalists, and the full weight of the ensemble is always felt. They’ve dialed down the volume, but not the frantic exuberance. On the joyous Afropop of "Trouble <neg>In the Streets</neg>" and the mandolin-powered raga "<neg>Try My Robe</neg>," the band’s female mouthpiece blares as loudly as she did on past acid-rock ragers, while the chirpy flute-folk of "<neg>Union of Sun and Moon</neg>" and "<neg>I Sing in Silence</neg>" do little to temper the band’s innate sense of groove.But while there’s a greater emphasis here on compact songcraft ("Alarms" could be a brown-acid <neg>Mamas and the Papas</neg>), GOAT are still at their most transfixing when they engage in rhythmic hypnotherapy. Requiem is a double album, granting the band the real estate to stretch out more than usual and, at times, you wish they’d go even further: the thundering "Temple Rhythms" teases the connection between campfire drum circles and piano-house raves, though it fades out before the band can properly build upon its vibrating foundation. However, with the self-referential "Goatband" and "Goatfuzz," Requiem erects its towering tentpole tracks: The former is a mesmerizing jangle jam where GOAT’s wah-wahed shredding dissolves into a textural haze; the latter is a rare moment of amped-up aggression whose electric-boogie breaks imagine <neg>Grand Funk Railroad</neg> riffing on ""<neg>Yoo Doo Right</neg>.""Despite their mosaic of international influences, GOAT are, at heart, a classic-rock band in pagan clothing. Even at their busiest, the group rarely veer toward confrontational chaos, and despite their sinister appearance, their lyrics are incense-scented, hippy-dippy platitudes (at times excessively so—this band has no compunction about giving its ballads names like "Psychedelic Lover"). But if you’re wondering how long GOAT can keep up the cult-rock gambit, well, there’s evidence here to suggest GOAT are pondering that very question, too.  Requiem’s penultimate track is an instrumental titled "Goodbye," which could very well just signal the album’s end, however, the sense of finality is compounded by the fact the song sounds like the Doors’ "<neg>The End</neg>" given an Indo-funk remix. It’s followed by the closing curio "Ubuntu," which reveals that GOAT haven’t just copped their sense of rhythm from African funk records, but their way of life as well. Atop free-form organ doodles, we hear recordings of men and women from the continent explaining the titular philosophy of connectedness and sharing, their sanguine sentiments ("I’m not human without your being present") folded into GOAT’s own communal ethos through a distant flashback of "Diarabi," the first song on the band’s first album, <neg>World Music</neg>. It’s the sort of full-circle move that suggests the closing of a chapter—but even if GOAT’s faces remain a mystery, with Requiem, they’ve at least showed us a bit more of their heart.   "4081	18289	"The curious mind of <name>Hans-Joachim Roedelius</name> continues to wander. His discography is so vast at this point, with so many notable collaborators picked up along the way, that even the most ardent krautrock obsessive probably doesn't own a complete set of his works. <name>Roedelius</name> is a founding member of Cluster and Harmonia, and made a handful of recordings with <name>Brian Eno</name> in the 1970s. But that's just scratching the surface of his output. To help make sense of it all, the chronology section of <name>Roedelius</name>' Wikipedia page is split into seven eras, split across six decades. The last entry at the time of writing this review is his unlikely matchup with English singer-songwriter <name>Lloyd Cole</name>. But <name>Roedelius</name> has already moved on from there, returning to <neg>Bureau B</neg> for this collaboration with <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg>/Kreidler musician <name>Stefan Schneider</name>. Even this is likely to be old material now, with barely a speck of dust allowed to settle on <name>Roedelius</name>'s console before he's off into the night, working elsewhere.At least this pairing makes some kind of sense, as it feels like <name>Roedelius</name> is working with someone who has the same inquisitive approach to electronic music as his own. <name>Schneider</name>'s not adverse to stretching outside his comfort zone, either; <neg>To Rococo Rot</neg> are known for going out on a limb on occasion, even remixing fey indie-pop outfit the Pastels. Still, Tiden isn't a great leap for either musician, with <name>Roedelius</name> providing tasteful classical piano at all the right junctures, and <name>Schneider</name> simply credited with contributing ""Elektronik"". The mood is resolutely introspective, but positively light and breezy throughout. Even when they hit a downward curve there's an element stirred into the mix that lifts the mood. ""Toast"" looks to be circling the hauntology sub-genre at one point, but gets a decent amount of uplift via familiar post-rock elements provided (presumably) by <name>Schneider</name>.This isn't the first time this pair have collaborated, making it no surprise that there's a comfort to Tiden that replaces the stiffening that sometimes beset Roedelius's work with <name>Cole</name>. At times it's a little too casual, causing certain tracks to form an uneven shape somewhere between bland piano bar noodling and something genuinely pretty-- There's even a track titled ""Mild"". When they don’t follow straight lines, adding discordance to the mix, there's a richness that puts the meandering material in the shade. Those moments come when rhythms don't follow logical patterns, or a darker edge is cut into the electronic shapes. It lends a sense of parity between the men and their machines, a feeling of them relinquishing control and removing some of the tight parameters, just to see where it will take them.<neg>On Tiden</neg> it's mostly pretty easy to pull apart tracks and figure out who did what, although there's never a feeling of two figures resting on their laurels. Occasionally it's reminiscent of that moment in the 90s when indie-rock and electronic music got all jumbled up, leading to excellent collaborations such as the contribution <neg>Mouse on Mars</neg> made to Stereolab's <neg>Dots and Loops</neg>. There's an amusingly titled track called ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" that nods to that era, although here a greater sense of sadness prevails. <neg>Where Dots and Loops</neg> reeked of optimism, on ""<neg>Indie Woogie</neg>"" there's a feeling of dreams burning down, of promise not being fulfilled. It's atypical of the overall mood, but illustrates a depth away from the soft glow at this album's core. Roedelius's thoughts are probably elsewhere anyway, shifting around ideas, figuring out a new set of altered states to explore next time."10975	10641	" Picture the most over-the-top clique of art connoisseurs conversing outside a cafe in Williamsburg, then imagine a soundtrack to said conversation. Congratulations, your brain's just imagineered <neg>Our Way Is Revenge</neg>, the debut from the Brooklyn-based hodgepodge <neg>Shock Cinema</neg>. Essentially the product of some intricate networking-- drummer <name>Miyuki Furtado</name> (Rogers Sisters) tours with <name>Katrina Ford</name> (Celebration), <name>Ford</name> recruits him a guitarist and singer, <neg>TV on the Radio</neg>'s <name>David Sitek</name> takes them under his wing, etc.-- the group totes a copious catalog of influences (both musical and non-musical) into this pithy 28-minute EP. Considering their eclectic shout-outs to <name>David Lynch</name>, Can, <name>Ennio Morricone</name>, and other high-minded luminaries, Shock Cinema's music fits snugly in the post-punk niche, the six tracks and two remixes providing few chances for anti-ingenue frontlady <name>Destiny Montague</name> to elude <name>Karen O</name>/<name>Vanessa Hay</name>/<name>Siouxsie Sioux</name> comparisons. The rest of the band follows suit, crafting tinny, echo-laden backing all within the confines of CBGB's safety restrictions, never blowing the roof off with any one riff or cymbal crash but adequately filling out the venue nonetheless. In modest doses, the pretentiousness and mimicry doesn't mean squat. Opener ""<neg>Breathe Again</neg>"" coasts on an ultra-cool surf guitar riff lifted from the <neg>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</neg>' <neg>Fever to Tell</neg>, but as the track disintegrates into ruckus and Montague's imagery of bodily harm comes to the foreground, you can hear echoes of a twisted <name>Kim Gordon</name>-led Sonic Youth number rather than stockpiled post-punk tropes. The three-piece garage assault boils over on ""<neg>Death in Texas</neg>"", perhaps the track where the presence of Trail of Dead bassist <name>Danny Wood</name> is most apparent. Although most of Revenge beats the chromatic scales and loud-soft dynamics to death, ""Texas"" doesn't relegate its riffs to the status of glorified vamps, a lesson the stagnant ""Aftr Hrs"" and ""<neg>Howling Door</neg> (Evasion)"" should jot down.  The album's more sluggish tracks, along with the slapdash pro-am remixes, compromise the fireworks provided by Revenge's more volatile songs. I understand the band refusing to fall rank and file behind the YYYs or <neg>Be Your Own Pet</neg>, but slowing things down painfully exposes their art-rock pablum. Unlike the Long Blondes or Love Is All, bands with similar post-punk/new wave aims yet broader palettes, <neg>Shock Cinema</neg> lack both the biting wit and endearing tenderness to complement their cerebral, misanthropic post-punk trappings. ""Art of Noir"", sung entirely in French, registers as something mildly charming and/or sexy, but its repetitive, back-and-forth raga has been done better by more stripped-down acts like Spoon, and the souped-up <neg>Giovanni Marks</neg> remix finds the track even less engaging on the dancefloor.  Ironically, the lack of anything remotely shocking is <neg>Shock Cinema</neg>'s <neg>Achilles heel</neg>. No one's getting points docked off the bat anymore for shameless soundalikes, but you still need to reflect your influences from a new, interesting angle. Considering how quickly this disparate group of musicians assembled, there's still loads of potential here waiting to be tapped, and Revenge comes packed with more than enough avenues for the band to journey down. Until then, though, this band's merely relaxing under the massive shade of their touchstones. "8500	13574	"In a recent interview, <neg>Massive Attack</neg>'s <name>Daddy G</name> claimed dubstepper Burial might remix the entire forthcoming <neg>Massive Attack</neg> album the same way Mad Professor remixed Protection on No Protection a decade and a half ago. That's a great look for Massive Attack; Burial's moody skitter-fog should mesh beautifully with Massive Attack's heady creep. But if the teaser EP Splitting the Atom is any indication, that Burial remix joint will probably make a better and more convincing Massive Attack album than the next actual <neg>Massive Attack</neg> album.That's not really a surprise. In the past 18 years, Massive Attack have released only four albums. And the last of those, 2003's 100th Window, was the first album of theirs to fully fade into wallpaper when you weren't paying very close attention. Since then, they've busied themselves with stuff like the score to the fairly badass <name>Jet Li</name> flick Unleashed, seemingly giving up on recapturing the power they once had. Back when they were pretty much inventing trip-hop, the group built bruised hellscapes out of whatever they could find: dusty rap breakbeats, film-score orchestral stabs, creeped-out 2-Tone skank. They knew just when to drop something unexpected into the mix, like the downtuned metal guitar that always raised goosebumps on ""Angel"". But on <neg>100th Window</neg>, they stopped building tracks, letting the grooves just sit there instead. And despite the deeply impressive roster of guest vocalists on Splitting the Atom, they're still stuck in that rut-- and, just as alarmingly, so are their remixers.<neg>Splitting the Atom</neg> has four tracks: two new originals, and two remixes of new songs we've yet to hear. The title track uses the deep mutters of 3D and <name>Daddy G</name> and the angelic, quavery croon of reggae vet and longtime collaborator <name>Horace Andy</name>. The track has all the elements of the group's classic sound: funhouse organs, ""<neg>Ghost Town</neg>"" echo-rattles, organ drone, voices that just flutter in the background without ever quite revealing themselves. The lyrics evoke a slow apocalypse: ""It never stops and we'll never learn/ No hope without dope and the jobless return."" But the song's drum-track is clumsy and pedestrian, and the song doesn't move toward anything; it just plods quietly along for five minutes. ""Pray for Rain"" recruits TV on the Radio's <name>Tunde Adebimpe</name> to growl stony, disconnected imagery over a sprawling, expansive groove. In its seven minutes, the song does hint at something bigger, but after the cool little Aphex Twin bleeps come in, it just doubles back to its slow beginning, repeating the whole first verse over again. These days, <name>Adebimpe</name>'s regular producer, <name>Dave Sitek</name>, is way better at these nervously monolithic jams.The two remixes, meanwhile, both seem content to sloppily imitate the Knife without really indicating that the songs underneath all the spooky vocoders are worthy of attention. Elbow's <name>Guy Garvey</name>'s mewls are barely audible on the <neg>Van Rivers</neg> and the <neg>Subliminal Kid</neg> remix of ""Bulletproof Love"", and onetime Tricky muse <name>Martina Topley-Bird</name> growls through filters on the Flash treatment of ""Psyche"". <neg>The Knife</neg> are a good blueprint for haunted synth tracks, and the version of ""Psyche"" might be the heaviest thing here, but it sounds nothing like <neg>Massive Attack</neg>. Maybe these original tracks will make more of an impact on the actual album, but I can't see how.With last year's Third, Bristol contemporaries Portishead proved that trip-hop old heads can still make damaged masterpieces that rival anything they ever did. But Portishead did it by leaping way beyond their old sound, not repeating their tricks and hoping they'll tickle the same buttons. If the next Massive Attack album is to mean anything, it'll need to do way more than play connect-the-dots with big-name collaborators-- it'll need to tap into something primal."6569	15513	"Punk rock has had its share of ambitious bands producing ambitious records-- <neg>Double Nickels on the Dime</neg>, <neg>Zen Arcade</neg>, Sandinista!, and <neg>The Shape of Punk to Come</neg> spring to mind-- but few groups in this sphere have pushed the envelope as often as <neg>Fucked Up</neg>. For the last few years, they've been releasing singles as part of a series based on the <neg>Chinese Zodiac</neg>, each of which usually runs over the 10-minute mark. For a 2007 charity Christmas single, they managed to get <name>James Murphy</name>, <name>Nelly Furtado</name>, and ""<neg>Degrassi: the Next Generation</neg>""/""<neg>90210</neg>"" actress <name>Shenae Grimes</name> (among many, many others) to appear on the same song; during a 12-hour (!) NYC concert in 2008, they got moshers to smash along to Vampire Weekend's <name>Ezra Koenig</name> doing Descendents covers. Their reach continues unabated on their new album, <neg>David Comes to Life</neg>, a 78-minute rock opera.The story of <neg>David Comes to Life</neg> is fairly complicated and, at points, heavily meta. It concerns a factory worker named <name>David Eliade</name> who falls in love with a woman named <name>Veronica Boisson</name>. They conspire to build a bomb together and death, destruction, and redemption follow; along the way, the story's narrator does battle with <name>David</name> for control of the plot. There's a long tradition of rock concept albums that aren't easy to understand, and this one is no exception; but enjoying it doesn't depend on decoding the tale. The record is divided into four separate acts, with a narrative focus that shifts from scene to scene-- a few songs are told from the overarching narrator's perspective, while David's ex-girlfriend, <name>Vivian Benson</name>, offers her side of the story in the album's back half. While a few guest vocalists are employed to help out-- Cults' <name>Madeline Follin</name> and singer/songwriter <name>Jennifer Castle</name> represent <name>Veronica</name> and <name>Vivian</name>, respectively-- the story is largely told by the band's screaming frontman, <name>Damien Abraham</name>, aka <neg>Pink Eyes</neg>. Taking into account the album's relatively limited range-- almost an hour and a half of straight-up bashing and riffage, with moments like the jangly acoustic figure that opens ""<neg>A Slanted Tone</neg>"" as a rare respite-- it becomes apparent that you will need a few listens and a lyric sheet to apprehend David Comes to Life's ambition and follow its labyrinthine storyline.Or, you could just sit back and let the record's dense, visceral blast of guitar squall wash over you. More than any single Fucked Up record, David Comes to Life is thick with walls of noisy melody. It's hard to get a handle on just how many guitar tracks are on a given song, and <name>Shane Stoneback</name> deserves a medal for mixing the sheer bulk of the sound into something so clear. But for all the shoegazey textures and blistering sonic assault, David Comes to Life is also direct and immediate. Hooks are piled on top of hooks, bursting through torrents of spacey noise (""I Was There"") and peppy rhythms (""<neg>The Recursive Girl</neg>"") alike. At points, the primal appeal of the blunt and effective riffing even brings to mind the bar-band rock of the Hold Steady.Out front, <name>Abraham</name> still retains his scorched-earth bark. He's been finding ways to broaden his voice's impact, and it's never sounded better than it does here. <name>Abraham</name> knows his range and limitations and is finding new ways to work within them while adjusting to the band's forward lurch, in effect becoming another instrument in the mix. His stomping melancholia on ""Turn the Season"" feels like a gut-check, while he follows up his sole quiet moment on album closer ""<neg>Lights Go Up</neg>"" by shouting amidst curled screams, ""I'm still in love with you/ After all of this time!"" Besides the aforementioned appearances by <name>Follin</name> and <name>Castle</name>, <name>Kurt Vile</name> delivers a typically slack backing vocal on ""<neg>Lights Go Up</neg>"", too-- but, really, this is <neg>The Pink Eyes Show</neg>, and it's never been so compelling to watch.That said, all the howling and the album's extreme length might be a tough thing for those new to <neg>Fucked Up</neg>. For people in this category, it might be best to check out Hidden World first; it's a good representation of how fun and hooky Fucked Up are when they're in the zone, and in many ways it's a simpler, spiritual precursor to this record. Regardless, <neg>David Comes to Life</neg> is absolutely worth the commitment, a convincing demonstration of what can happen when a band works without limitations."15210	4150	"...And you will know them by their long, purposefully unwieldy moniker.  Or perhaps you will know them because Spoon's <name>Britt Daniel</name> produced their debut EP.  Either way, the five guys who constitute Austin's <neg>I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness</neg> (including a couple past members of <neg>Windsor for the Derby</neg> and <name>Paul Newman</name>) are obviously adept at cultivating attention-- and it turns out that they actually merit some, too, if this five-song starter kit is any indication.  <name>Daniel</name> may be the big name on this marquee, but his presence is basically incidental, as he does his best to naturally capture the band doing their thing; reverb is about the most drastic addition he makes. Initially, listening to the band just do their thing without any attendant bells and whistles threatens overwhelming boredom-- they've strangely sequenced the absolute least engaging song at the beginning the EP.  ""We're Still the Weaker Sex"" isn't a bad song, per se, but if <name>Nelson</name> had opened with a bow shot like this he probably would have lost at Trafalgar.  The vocals are buried under clean, start/stop electric guitars, and though the music builds nicely as the drums pick up on the guitar rhythms and the band slides into a slippery faux-jazz groove, the melody never really builds with it, and the song fails to stick as a result, though the acceleration for the spiraling guitar outro is pretty exhilarating.  Thankfully, it's nothing but broadsides of tightly constructed, Factory-brand indie rock, and soon enough, your battleship is sunk by the slow build and nagging guitars of ""<neg>The Less You See</neg>"", a Slint-lite swoon that climaxes with an airy bridge instead of a blistering pileup.  The band hold their aces for the last two spots on the disc, though, unloading with the spiky disco stomp of ""<neg>When You Go Out</neg>"" on track four and proving why we should be paying attention.  The detached, everyman harmonies sink into the band's best melody while the guitars scour the stratosphere with insistently droning lines that seem to ricochet off the open hi-hats.  Closer ""<neg>Your Worst Is the Best</neg>"" drives home the fact that the band are at their best and most memorable when the vocals are performed in tandem, and the chiming guitars and electric piano of the first few verses create a crystalline, womb-like effect.  The song dissipates into a keyboard ether, leaving behind thoughts of Big Things to come for the quintet.  I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness already have the sound of a pink and grey counterpart to Interpol's red and black, and the Spoon connection feels logical, given the band's penchant for pop with a bite and a new wave edge.  If they can deliver on their promise, we'll soon know them for a lot more than their name."14989	6330	"Last time around, <neg>The Places</neg> set their sights on comets and quasars.  Singer/songwriter <name>Amy Annelle</name> tapped a who's who of <neg>Portland, Oregon</neg> to record <neg>The Autopilot Knows You Best</neg>, a minor masterpiece of indie pop where folky violin and accordions complemented the crazy-scientist sounds of shortwave static and lost voices.  Melodic indie pop brushed against swaying acoustic ballads, and although her low, murmuring voice gave it a dreamy coherence, Autopilot was also an exciting patchwork: Each track made a new discovery.  The follow-up, finished in 2002 but not released until this month, couldn't be more different.  On <neg>Call It Sleep</neg>, exhaustion hangs from <name>Annelle</name>'s voice like dust in her hair.  Each ballad sounds weary to the bone, not from melancholy or a nameable heartache, but like built-up fatigue: <name>Annelle</name> has flopped on your couch after ten hours of crossing dry, identical landscapes, and you can't tell if she wants to talk about it.  The album runs more slowly and evenly than Autopilot, as lazy guitars scraggle over the shuffling of drums and upright bass, but the focus lies with <name>Annelle</name> and the nuances in her vocals.  She sings in a low voice whose undertones resonate like blowing on the neck of a beer bottle.  Intimate and unforced, she comes close to vanishing before your eyes: Witness how ethereally she blends into the radio static on ""Program Ten"". And by singing quietly, she compels, especially when she pipes up or lets the notes swell and coast, as on ""<neg>Ruined New Life</neg>"".  At its best, <neg>Call It Sleep</neg> has gorgeous melodies and a clear sense for atmosphere, never overplaying its fragility or stifling the mood.  She refrains from big moments, except on the album's more propulsive finish, ""'<neg>Til the Death</neg>""-- but more typical are the sways from troubled to resolute, the shift from ""<neg>Travel Light</neg>""'s desolation to the steady outdoor cantina waltz of ""<neg>Clean Starts</neg>"".  But it's also a less remarkable album than its predecessor, despite its own round of guest stars.  Members of <neg>The Decemberists</neg>, The Swords Project, and Death Cab for Cutie, but nobody steals the spotlight: The extra instrumentation they provide is subtle, from the treading-on-glass vibes to the half-drowned piano on the achingly delicate ""<neg>Dead Reckoning</neg>"".  Additionally, fans of Autopilot might miss the quirky variety and ""geek chic"" of its experimentation and science references; on her cover of The Dreamies' ""Program Ten"", <name>Annelle</name> takes some playtime with shortwaves and sampling, but it's not as ebullient as the last album's cover of <name>Syd Barrett</name>'s ""Late Night"".  The tone is heavy, and the decision to sequence the slowest songs (""<neg>What I Wouldn't Do for You</neg>"", ""<neg>Travel Light</neg>"") in succession almost stops the album.  <neg>Where The Places</neg>' last LP served as a pop complement to <name>Annelle</name>'s quieter solo outings, Call It Sleep doesn't spark new ideas so much as shore up her work as a singer and songwriter.  Ultimately, <neg>Call It Sleep</neg> works as a transition album-- in her career, and also in the content of her lyrics.  Even at its quietest, the record isn't sad so much as pensive: The ballads' reserve and the song titles like ""<neg>Clean Starts</neg>"", ""<neg>Travel Light</neg>"", or ""<neg>Ruined New Life</neg>"" evoke a sense of <name>Annelle</name> changing gears and deciding where to head next.  She doesn't conjure as many possibilities as before, but she hones in on the choices that count."16157	1698	"Hey you.  Yeah, you, holding a copy of <neg>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</neg> with an Adaptation ticket stub for a bookmark.  You're obviously hip to the new sensation sweeping the nation: meta-fiction! <name>Maurice</name> the <neg>Meta-fiction Moose</neg> defines the genre as ""post-modern art conscious of and reveling in its own limitations"" and it's in full bloom everywhere from the bookstore to the Cineplex, with TV-show characters talking to the camera in-between.  Hell, even record reviews do it-- I crafted a densely mirrored concept review around this latest release from Cursive, but it turned out to be too pretentious for prime-time (watch for it in my forthcoming collection of short stories about famous Omahaians).  One media form yet to be infiltrated by the gimmick of self-reference, however, is music, partly because it's more than a little difficult to do in a three-minute pop song, and partly because <name>Jon Spencer</name> ruined it for everybody.  But Cursive frontman <name>Kasher</name> is willing to give it the old college try on <neg>The Ugly Organ</neg>, and somehow manages to do it with a minimum of pretension while simultaneously livening up the crusted emo messenger bag.  Cursive is no stranger to the concept album; their last full-length, Domestica, was a song-cycle dealing with the critical entropy of a dying marriage, and its warm reception seems to have motivated <name>Kasher</name> to stay in the storyteller role.  The ""plot"" of <neg>The Ugly Organ</neg>, such as it is, revolves around loose themes of fallout remorse and hollow sexual meandering, the latter summed up in the double meaning of the album title. Appropriately, then, recurring organ figures occasionally torment <name>Kasher</name>'s protagonist mid-song, while recent Cursive recruit <name>Gretta Cohn</name>'s cello grants everything the epic quality it so desperately calls for.  The material fueled by this concept is pretty easy to spot, bearing woe-packed titles like ""<neg>The Recluse</neg>"", ""Driftwood"", or ""<neg>Bloody Murderer</neg>"", and aside from the occasional Diaryland line (""My ego's like my stomach/ It keeps shitting what I feed it""), it's a solid record for those without severe emo allergies.  ""The Recluse"" is melancholy and full of ornate note flurries like early <name>Joan</name> of Arc, and the eerie ""Driftwood"" creeps along like ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" beneath <name>Cohn</name>'s bowed swooshes.  An entire LP of this slumped-shoulder soul-searching would get pretty tired, however; a fact that even <name>Kasher</name> seemed to realize as he browsed back over the sad-sack lyrics he'd penned.  Enter the meta: a handful of songs wherein <name>Kasher</name> either ups the self-loathing ante by both expressing his sadness and further expressing his sadness about his sadness, or brilliantly anticipates the kneejerk reactions of the emo-phobic critical community (not here, of course, no, never!).  Opening the album with the couplet, ""And now we proudly present/ Songs perverse and songs of lament,"" <name>Kasher</name> makes a habit of anticipating the snide commentary of his hatas and beating them to the punch.  ""<neg>Art Is Hard</neg>"" assails his own band with the biting stab ""cut it out/ Your self inflicted pain/ Is getting too routine/ The crowds are catching on/ To the self-inflicted song,"" and he styles ""<neg>Butcher the Song</neg>"" ambiguously enough to make vain critics betcha think he's talking about them, don't we, don't we: ""I'm writing songs to entertain/ But these people, they just want pain.""  Wisely, <name>Kasher</name> also attaches these masochistic episodes to the strongest songs of the album: ""Red Handed Slight of Hand"" being all raw anthem like Desaparecidos without the limited understanding of the geopolitical landscape, and ""<neg>Art Is Hard</neg>"" using <name>Cohn</name> to her fullest as the rest of the band emulates her fierce bowing while she rips out a buzzsaw melody like a <name>Dick Dale</name> cello composition.  Even ""Butcher the Song"" which turns on a sour riff repeated ad nauseam, has a sort of, well, nauseating effect that emphasizes the self-sickened words.  With the strength of the meta-emo material, plus ""The Recluse"" and ""Driftwood"", occupying the first half of the album, it's easy to get caught up in The Ugly Organ's bold aims.  Unfortunately, the album is too top-heavy to be seaworthy, the back end full of Fugazi knockoffs and half a song stretched out to ten minutes in a forced attempt at a showstopping finale (""Staying Alive""-- they'd be better off with a Bee Gees cover). The fact that <name>Kasher</name>, in a toe-dipping test of this meta stuff, already called himself out as a Mackaye acolyte on Cursive's last EP can't save the likes of ""Sierra"" and ""<neg>Gentleman Caller</neg>"" from my seen-it-all scorn.  Bah.  Still, a solid side A is enough to make <neg>The Ugly Organ</neg> an emo album (gasp!) on <neg>Saddle Creek</neg> (yipes!) that I'm not ashamed to admit a conditional liking for.  Should <name>Kasher</name> decide to continue along the concept album path, it would perhaps do him good to study himself some <neg>Pedro the Lion</neg>-- and he might want to steer clear of the meta from here on out-- I hear from <neg>New York</neg> that unironic is the new ironic.  But for twenty minutes of <neg>The Ugly Organ</neg>, what he's got now is enough to make an idea that sounds, on paper, a million ways wrong and a shoo-in for <neg>Most Self-Indulgent Album of the Year</neg> work reasonably well.  Here's hoping he draws someone less homely than <neg>Nicholas Cage</neg> for the film version."193	22578	For the lead single of her second album, <name>Tove Lo</name> chose as inspiration one of the most-circulated and least-understood literary quotes of the past decade, the "<neg>Cool Girl</neg>" monologue from <name>Gillian Flynn</name>’s Gone Girl: "Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. <neg>Being the Cool Girl</neg> means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. <neg>Cool Girls</neg> never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the <neg>Cool Girl</neg>." People circulating this quote almost always leave out the fact that the woman delivering this soliloquy is a psychopath who will go on to rack up a body count. But why they circulate it is more telling: that in her misanthropy she’s elucidated something very real about relationships, and very bleak.<name>Tove Lo</name> knows a bit about bleakness and misunderstanding; she’s courted both from her first single. The bluntness of "Habits (Stay High)" ensured it’d cut through the crowd of anodyne rising pop stars but also ensured that for the next year <name>Lo</name> would field interviews about whether she actually lurked in sex clubs and picked up daddies on the playground. As a student of confessionalism, she knows audiences have an endless appetite for scandalous female writers, from <name>Mary McCarthy</name> to <name>Cat Marnell</name> to <name>Fiona Apple</name> to <name>Britney Spears</name>, and that they crave their honesty less than they do their imagined autobiographies, their self-destruction and bare flayed skin. As a student of pop, she knows that her industry parses women's vulnerability as empowerment, their pain as sexiness, their point as pop as usual. <name>Lo</name> certainly leaves herself open to misinterpretation—her Sticky Fingers-via-creepshot album art, her music’s endlessly quotable debauchery. Perhaps knowing this, she practically spells Lady Wood out: putting an explanatory interlude in the outro of "Imaginary Friend" ("I don’t know... I guess it’s kind of like a voice in my heart reminding me that there's nothing to fear"), all but defining "lady wood" on the title track, or addressing the audience on "Cool Girl": "Now you can’t tell if I’m really ironic," <name>Lo</name> sings, absolutely correctly."<neg>Cool Girl</neg>" is equally a pop song, a delivery device for a sassy, stuttery chorus about being a cool girl. It's the line all smart music walks, and Lady Wood walks at album length. The album’s a showcase for Wolf Cousins, the <name>Max Martin</name>-affiliated songwriting collective that includes <name>Lo</name> and nearly a dozen others, including Swedish writer <name>Ilya Salmanzadeh</name>, Iranian producer <name>Ali Payami</name> and production duo the Struts. They’ve written about half the charts, but Lady Wood is as concentrated an outlet for their sound as you’ll find. But it’s equally a platform for <name>Lo</name> to argue, as she did on <neg>Queen of the Clouds</neg>, that the self-destructive affairs of a particular sort of woman are a subject worthy of four-part concept albums. <neg>Lady Wood</neg> is the first two parts: the high and the comedown, the party and the afterparty. The structural resemblance to the Weeknd’s EPs isn’t accidental. When <name>Abel Tesfaye</name> worked with the Scandinavian claque he became <name>Lo</name>’s direct colleague, and the debauched tableaux and nervous vocal tics of tracks like "<neg>Don’t Talk About It</neg>" and "<neg>Keep It Simple</neg>" sound almost tailor-written for him. The sound is basically the same, too: nocturnal, minor-key synthpop, less suited to dancing with tears in your eyes than waking up alone and disheveled the morning after. It’s the same sound the Wolves have worked for over a year, but in <name>Tove</name> as in <name>Abel</name> they’ve found an ideal collaborator, one who goes as dark as they do. For the most part, <neg>Lady Wood</neg> abandons the shock value of its predecessor; the title track and a couple nods to being "under the influence" are about as explicit as things get. But her ruminations and obsessions are the same: the fleeting freedom found in bad behavior; the compulsion of her women to tamp down their desires and their inability to do so; envy of the men in her misadventures, who have it easy. It’d be easy to play this as melodrama, but <name>Lo</name> sings most of the album without affect, so when she does emote, it counts for more: sneaking cutesy <name>Betty Boop</name> inflections into the backing vocals of "<neg>Cool Girl</neg>"'s chorus, belting into the void on the ballads, exclaiming "I’m gonna get hurt!" like it’s her deepest desire. That's on standout "<neg>True Disaster</neg>," which begins as Marr-like feedback haze and turns into one of the year's best pop songs, a perfectly wrought instrument of self-laceration. (The effect’s somewhat ruined when the titular disaster reveals himself two songs later as mealy-voiced <name>Joe Janiak</name>, who barely sounds capable of manipulating a coffee machine, let alone a woman. This is why "True Disaster" should be a single.)That said, "<neg>True Disaster</neg>" isn't a perfect pop song. It suffers from <name>Tove Lo</name>’s primary weakness as a songwriter: her compulsion, at least once per track, to include a line that her Scandinavian colleagues might call "juicy" but that comes off more like a brand saying bae. At least on a track called "Lady Wood" you know what you're getting, but nothing about "True Disaster" prepares you for the line "I can't hide my feels." Even the tracks free of such nonsense are so unrelentingly bleak and so professionally done that, at album length, they become interchangeable well-produced malaise. Yet when <neg>Lady Wood</neg> tries to go upbeat—as on "<neg>Imaginary Friend</neg>" and "<neg>WTF Love Is</neg>"—the resulting tracks are the weakest by far. The bridge to "<neg>Cool Girl</neg>" is designed to be the emotional core of the whole album, the moment <name>Lo</name> lets her guard down and reveals her true desires, but it just sounds like she’s emulating Sia. Proportionally, these are trivial complaints. <neg>Lady Wood</neg> is short, but <name>Lo</name> finds ample darkness to plumb. "Don’t Talk About It" recasts the girl squads so ubiquitous in pop culture as nihilistic cliques hazing each other into empty highs and dead-eyed selfies. "Flashes" does the same without the squad, <name>Lo</name> lamenting the effect on friends back home of so much mining her life for content: "When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes, what about you?" "Vibes" is deceptively chill, the supposedly lighthearted flirting of two parties with nothing between them but contempt. "What's your line, though?... Heard that before," <name>Lo</name> teases, only to be negged down by <name>Janiak</name>. And "<neg>Keep It Simple</neg>"—befitting the title, just <name>Lo</name> and Cousins standout <name>Payami</name>—presents a scenario both hyper-specific and likely relatable: lying in bed with a rebound at some garbage hour of the night, flipping through an ex’s old sexts, feeling nothing. <name>Payami</name>’s synths land fast and loud like thunderclaps, and <name>Lo</name> pushes any impending connection or intimacy back into the dark. Then she pulls herself together for the drop, the cool girl once more.14925	8259	"Just like that daintily wrapped, pseudo-gourmet brie stocked on the Safeway shelf near the <neg>Kraft Singles</neg> and shredded cheddar, <neg>Tahiti 80</neg>'s creamy, dreamy delicacies are manufactured for easy export.  <name>Xavier Boyer</name> and his gang of merry Parisians embody that quintessentially Gallic combination of élan and ennui, vigor and boredom-- those seemingly antithetical traits the French can so easily capture with the slightest Gauloises-punctuated gesture or well-placed <name>Camus</name> quotation.  With <neg>A Piece of Sunshine</neg>, Tahiti 80 masterfully temper their continental contradictions with tender melodrama and songs sung in surprisingly facile English, turning out a sophisticated, trans-Atlantic paean in the universal language of pop. Their third outing on Chicago's Francophilic imprint <neg>Minty Fresh</neg> finds <neg>Tahiti 80</neg> at their most succinct and confident.  Here, they've trimmed the psychedelic pomp from last year's <neg>Wallpaper for the Soul</neg> to reveal a radiant core of impeccable songwriting and elevated arrangements.  Even in its gel-capped accessibility, the album remains complex and absorbing, a gorgeous, multifaceted jewel of acid-washed guitars, glittery horn flourishes, and frayed electronic texture. While Tahiti 80 are certainly beholden to the great bubblegum symphony conductors like <name>Brian Wilson</name> and <name>Van Dyke Parks</name>, their streamlined packaging and electronic frills also resemble FM radio champs like The Cardigans and The Beautiful South.  The whistled melody that bisects ""Listen""'s jangled guitar and sweeping Mellotron matches the sober theme of <name>Boyer</name>'s lyrics: ""It's easy to think you are special/ Simple to find out after all/ You're just like anybody else/ That's all.""  The brooding ""Aftermath"" hints at anxious foreboding, its minor-key pedal steel and glitchy, space-rock effects hinting at some looming depression the song's gilded chorus keeps at bay, while the folk-funk of ""<neg>Don't Misunderstand</neg>"" segues from gentle acoustic strumming into a lush electronic crunch, a duality that's presented effortlessly and effectively. In a culture where all art is high art-- from Herbie the Love Bug and <name>Jerry Lewis</name> to <name>Manu Chao</name> and Daft Punk-- where <name>Serge Gainsbourg</name>'s biggest multi-platinum hit was straightfacedly titled (translated from the idiomatic, idiosyncratic French) ""I Love You... Me Neither"", turning seemingly standard radio-friendly histrionics into pop perfection comes rather easily.  To wit: Sunshine's peak moment, the inexplicably titled ""Antonelli.""  At precisely three minutes, five seconds of undeniable glory, the song rises halfway through this underlong album and stands out like a monument.  ""Antonelli"" features Tahiti 80's brilliantly precise blending of diffuse pop elements: grandiose horn parts, grinding electronic bass, sonorous drums, echoing guitar, all wrapped up in shimmering, airtight production.  It's a soaring, fully realized instrumental pop anthem that wouldn't be out of place standing next to Stereolab at their most ambitious or <neg>The Flaming Lips</neg> at their most sober. When the album finally closes with ""<neg>In My Arms</neg>"", a bittersweet acoustic ballad, we're ready for a comedown. Even at a mere 25 minutes long (barely qualifying it as an EP in some circles) <neg>A Piece of Sunshine</neg> manages to pack in a stunning amount of music.  Tahiti 80 cuts off more than just a piece; they lay out the whole damn sunshiney pie on the table and dole out more than enough to share."3515	18793	"<name>Nick Drake</name> did not lead a colorful life.  Shy, abstracted, and bad with eye contact, he shuttled quietly from boarding school to prep school to Cambridge and made few friends along the way. The most rebellious act of his youth was a note politely informing his tutor he was leaving school. His musical career was a disaster, but not a funny or entertaining one—his albums were simply ignored and audiences talked obliviously through his live gigs. He moved back home, fell into a deep depression, and one night, either by accident or on purpose, took too many pills. When he died, there was almost nothing to feel good about.This has proved a difficult predicament for the record labels charged with profiting off his legacy. The posthumous marketing of <name>Nick Drake</name>'s music has been arduous and fitful, a decades-long attempt at setting right what everyone agreed went horribly wrong the first time. First there was 1979's overpriced Fruit Tree box, which bombed. Then came the slightly more successful 1985 best-of Heaven in a <neg>Wild Flower</neg> and 1986’s <neg>Time of No Reply</neg>,  a collection of rare and officially unreleased tracks. His cult profile rose modestly through the 90s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when "Pink Moon" famously found its way into a Cabrio commercial, that <name>Nick Drake</name>'s fortune as a ""penniless genius"" finally received its uplifting footnote. Since then, there has been a flurry of release activity, all of it packaging the same tiny body of work spanning six years. <name>Nick Drake</name> is finally famous, but it took the record industry 40 years to figure out how to make it happen.It's worth revisiting this dubious history while considering Tuck Box, the latest and possibly final repackaging. Alongside his three studio albums—Five Leaves Left, Bryter Layter, and Pink Moon—this boxed set includes the 2004 compilation <neg>Made to Love Magic</neg>, (itself a barely altered repackaging of Time of No Reply) as well as Family Tree, a 2007 collection of <name>Nick Drake</name>'s <neg>home recordings</neg> with a few short, haunting songs by his mother, the folk singer and poet <name>Molly</name>. There is not a single second of new or unreleased music waiting for you inside this handsomely designed object, in other words; the packaging, which replicates the wooden box that <name>Nick Drake</name>’s mother used to send him cakes in while he was at Marlborough College, is the sole original flourish.What Tuck Box offers, then, is simply another chance to revisit <name>Nick Drake</name>'s short, sad story. Because <name>Drake</name> died in desolation and obscurity, and because his music grows more influential every year, there will never quite be a bad moment to rediscover him. His three studio albums have settled into cultural totems, albums that anyone hoping to know something about rock history buys sooner or later. Even 40-odd years later, their thumbprint remains unique, a strange and compelling mix of timeless poetic melancholy on the one hand, and cloistered, pampered schoolboy modernity on the other. They sit completely to the left of all rock music, which <name>Drake</name> could care less about; his version of a garage band was a group of boys at his boarding school, one of whom was the grand-nephew of <name>John Maynard Keynes</name>. (Their name was the Perfumed Gardeners.)<name>Drake</name> was influenced instead by British folk royalty like <name>John Martyn</name> and <name>Bert Jansch</name>, or <name>Ashley Hutchings</name> of the Fairport Convention. When he recorded his debut, 1969’s Five Leaves Left, he must have felt, at least momentarily, that he was joining their ranks. It was <name>Hutchings</name> who had enthusiastically approached <name>Drake</name> in local pub <neg>The Roundhouse</neg>, offering to pass his information along to the legendary manager <name>Joe Boyd</name>. <name>Drake</name>'s entrance into the business, at least, was effortless and auspicious, and he was joined in the <neg>Sound Techniques</neg> recording studio by a few of his personal heroes. <neg>The warm</neg>, rounded upright bass playing is from <name>Danny Thompson</name>, a founding member of the Pentangle. <name>Richard Thompson</name> plays the pearly guitar leads. Listening to "<neg>Time Has Told Me</neg>", the first song on his debut album, is to hear to what might very well be the happiest and most fulfilling moment of <name>Nick Drake</name>’s professional life.Even as a 20-year-old, <name>Drake</name>'s vision for his music was strikingly assured. He was nervous, fumbling, and difficult to engage in conversation in the studio, but he knew what he wanted. He calmly insisted that <name>Boyd</name> and <name>John Wood</name> hire arranger <name>Robert Kirby</name>, a fellow student at Cambridge. Bewildered, they obeyed, and were rewarded with the breathtaking string chart for "Way to Blue". With its clean lines and grave elegance, ""Way to Blue"" suggests the philosophy that would distinguish <name>Nick Drake</name>’s music over the years and damn it during his lifetime: in <name>Joe Boyd</name>’s words, it simply  "was not reaching out to you."" <name>Drake</name> was painfully English, and showiness wasn’t really in his nature. But profundity glowed from his music.This approach extends to his guitar playing, which was so obsessively perfect it almost escapes comprehension. You will never hear a single string buzz. It's not the sort of virtuosity that quiets a chattering crowd, but once you've attuned to the absolute silence, it quickly grows otherworldly. Even on densely packed fingerpicking runs like ""<neg>Day Is Done</neg>"", each note sits in the mix like a stone at the floor of a clear pond. He was a frighteningly flawless player, in a way that served to magnify his incorporeality: There is no surviving video of <name>Nick Drake</name> playing live or talking. He died in 1974, but his physicality is as remote to our modern imagination as <name>Gustav Mahler</name>'s.His concerns were similarly otherworldly and timeless, informed by a childhood of <neg>English Romantic</neg> poets. The futility of knowing the mind of another was a persistent theme in his lyrics, which looked right past people to stars, trees, eternity. "Who can know the thoughts of <name>Mary Jane</name>?" <name>Drake</name> muses. "Who can know the reason for her smile?" His music viewed human behavior and its peculiarities with quizzical detachment, even when the case study is <name>Drake</name> himself: "So I'll leave the ways that are making me be/ What I really don't want to be,", he sings on ""<neg>Time Has Told Me</neg>"". Sizing up the enormity of this task, examining how it might be accomplished—these were not really his philosophical concerns. They overwhelmed him or they simply didn’t interest him, but either way, they came to trip him up, as they do us all.When it was released in the fall of 1969, Five Leaves Left went unnoticed. Island Records had done it no favors. The packaging was insultingly botched; two songs—""<neg>Day Is Done</neg>" and "<neg>Way To Blue</neg>"—were switched in the tracklisting and "<neg>Three Hours</neg>" was mistakenly titled "Sundown". But <name>Drake</name> was also complicit; he began his first ill-fated tour behind the faltering album, and between songs, he would tune his guitar for minutes on end to stony, uncomfortable silence. He often walked off dejected before finishing his set. He disappeared into dope smoke, a predilection that was slowly hardening into a crutch. He blew off radio sessions and interviews and slowly began retreating into himself. It was under these circumstances that he ventured back into the studio for Bryter Layter, his second full-length.Ironically, it was initially conceived as his ""up"" album, a poppy rejoinder to Five Leaves Left. Five Leaves was pastoral, written in the wooded confines of Cambridge. Layter was written in London, and was meant to reflect urbanity. It did, but only from the perspective of <name>Drake</name>'s one bloodshot eye, peering out cautiously at the world. Over woolly saxophone on ""<neg>At the Chime of a City Clock</neg>"", he confesses ""I stay indoors beneath the floors and talk with neighbors only/ The games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely"". Over the peppy horn charts of ""Hazey Jane II"", <name>Drake</name> sings lightly of how it feels ""when the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning."" The city, on <neg>Bryter Layter</neg>, is one long harsh unpleasant noise occurring outside. Nothing good or stimulating seems to happen there.The music, however, is brighter—this is the <name>Nick Drake</name> you can hear reflected in latter-period Belle and Sebastian. He rehearsed with a band for the first time, including other members of Fairport Convention, and the result is the most fulsome studio recording he ever managed. Some of the arrangement decisions remain bewildering—the gospel backup vocals, jazz-comping guitar and noodling piano crowding the space on ""Poor Boy"" remain as jarring now as they were when the album was released. On ""Fly"" and ""<neg>Northern Sky</neg>"", <name>Drake</name> worked with <name>John Cale</name>, and you can hear a more natural dynamic in their collaboration. It's either a shame or a relief they didn't work together longer: ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky""are the two most affecting songs on Bryter, but it's also likely <name>Cale</name> introduced <name>Drake</name> to heroin.On Pink Moon, <name>Nick Drake</name>’s final official album, there is one single overdub: the piano part drifting over the title track. The rest is just <name>Drake</name>, his pristine, eerily perfect playing, his mumbling, and silence. Bryter had also sold poorly and received near-zero notices—the most favorable review compared it to ""<neg>Classical Gas</neg>"". By now, he hardly spoke to anyone; in between takes, <name>John Wood</name> remembers, <name>Drake</name> betrayed neither pleasure or displeasure. He simply sat. <name>Keith Morris</name>, the photographer who shot the album's photography, remarked that working with <name>Drake</name> was ""like working with still life."" The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When <name>Drake</name> was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.A ""<neg>pink moon</neg>"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""<neg>Pink Moon</neg>"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. <name>Drake</name>'s voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in Pink Moon, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of <name>Drake</name>'s vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between <name>Drake</name> and the world at large. There is a stillness to <name>Nick Drake</name>'s music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and Pink Moon is its purest expression. It remains the <name>Nick Drake</name> record most people begin with, and for good reason.The eleven songs on Pink Moon were not <name>Nick Drake</name>'s final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. <name>Joe Boyd</name> recalls that <name>Drake</name>, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""<neg>Black Eyed Dog</neg>"", ""<neg>Rider on the Wheel</neg>"", ""<neg>Tow the Line</neg>"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""<neg>Black Eyed Dog</neg>"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.The most consequential material on Made to Love Magic remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory "Clothes of Sand" and the odd, jaunty "Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when <name>Drake</name> was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of Five Leaves Left; an early alternate take of ""<neg>Thoughts of Mary Jane</neg>"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from <name>Richard Thompson</name>. There are a handful of performances from <name>Drake</name>'s first-ever public concert, the so-called ""<neg>work tape</neg>"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the <name>Nick Drake</name> story.  Family Tree, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of <name>Nick Drake</name>—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of <name>Mozart</name> trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.Family Tree doesn’t give the world any classic lost <name>Nick Drake</name> music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the <name>Drakes</name>' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual <neg>tea cups</neg> in the background of his cover of <name>Bob Dylan</name>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear <name>Nick Drake</name> messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""<neg>Cocaine Blues</neg>"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier <name>Nick Drake</name> than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.Family Tree also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""<neg>Poor Mum</neg>"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""<neg>Poor Boy</neg>""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""<neg>Do You Ever Remember</neg>"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""This was <name>Nick Drake</name>'s existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer <name>Joe Boyd</name> for his failed career on ""<neg>Hanging on a Star</neg>"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy."15285	423	"Most people seem to hold a fundamental aversion to making a pure spectacle of themselves.  It's a fact I find dispiriting, yet quite the rule: Save an opportunity to score a few second's face time on the latest shock brand of reality television, the rewards don't justify the risk these days.  Conformity pays and pays well.  I take in uptown Charlotte, surveying battalions of reinforcements along Trade Street as the mere differentiating factors between any two brave jaywalkers are found in the silver letters of a briefcase monogram or the fit on a pair of pleated khakis.  There's no pageantry, no ostentation, no grandstanding-- no damn fun.  And I'll wager now that <neg>An Albatross</neg> will never play here.  This transplanted Pennsylvanian is good for at least a word of warning to the band: Do not schedule us.  This banker's paradise couldn't host any of Philadelphia-bred An Albatross' wildly off kilter expositions of dissevered carnivalesque dementia.  Depending on when and where you catch them, you could witness anything from costumed sock-hopping to orgiastic food fights-- and all set to the band's sub-minute, licentious flurries of proletariat dance metal intoxication. <neg>We Are the Lazer Viking</neg>, the band's sophomore effort, captures eleven songs in about eight minutes. Ranging in length between :21 and 1:24, these brief tracks spotlight vocalist <name>Edward B. Geida III</name> shrieking his way through volatile bursts of digital meltdown and pure metalthrashing.  New to the band is a second keyboard player, which serves to clean up the sound a bit; his oddly inviting Farfisa melodies form the bedrock of most of the album, surfacing even when you don't have time enough to bob your head but twice.  The highlight might be the 1:13 of ""The Revolutionary Politics of Dance"", and (1:24 later) the :42 of ""Get Faster, Cry for Happy"".  Both songs blend electric grindcore bursts and wavelike synth-lulls into supremely rhythmic bouts of delirium.  Of the three instrumental tracks, ""J7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j7j"" sounds like a peek at the broiled labor of a steel-factory, while closer ""W7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7w7"" is cartoonish enough to feel at home on a <name>Max Tundra</name> album.  Oh, brave Vikings of the North, your apocalyptic unrest is valiant.  Though I suppose the live show of foreboding destruction is the real <neg>An Albatross</neg> experience; the record doesn't satisfy.  If you live in a real city, though, consider this a warning."10434	11198	" The cover of <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg>'s debut album, Moonbeams, features a topless swimmer arced in mid-air, turning a fall into a graceful dive. Taken by Norwegian photographer <name>Heidi Johansen</name>, the image has the feel of an unstaged vacation souvenir: There's a boat in the background, a towel draped loosely around another woman's head, and a big toe intruding into the lower-left hand corner. It's well chosen: The casual composition and playful flash of nudity say quite a bit about the music contained therein, despite not including the name of the band or the title of the album. Moonbeams is a collection of loosely staged fuzz-pop songs about travel and sexual treachery, possessing a lens flare of regret even as they portray the singer-- or at least his first-person counterpart in these songs-- as a ""lusty"" soul living from one hook-up to another. Throw Me the Statue is the clunky pseudonym for <name>Scott Reitherman</name>, who plays almost every instrument on Moonbeams and even released it on his own label before signing with Secretly Canadian. He introduces opener ""Young Sensualists"" with a brief overture of bright synths, then fades into darker, droning chords for his tale of a beach-set love triangle. The simple plucked strings, programmed beat, and melodic guitar solo give the impression of one guy turning himself into a band. And yet, just as the title hints at <neg>youthful self-mythologizing</neg>, the vacation details suggest that the inspiration came not from a postcard tacked to a bedroom wall, but seemingly from real experience. The rest of Moonbeams bolsters that impression. <name>Reitherman</name> comes across as far too social-- and far too well-traveled-- for such a solitary pursuit; as the cover art suggests, he's too worldly and musically curious to shut himself in. Moonbeams features a small backing band and a revolving roster of guests, including multi-instrumentalist/producer <name>Casey Foubert</name>, who has worked with Pedro the Lion and <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>. There are horns on ""Groundswell"", samples on ""Yucatan Gold"", and what sounds like an ambient accordion on the title track. Occasionally <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg>'s musical range seems like an end in itself, as if eclectica were its own genre, but generally <name>Reitherman</name>'s range highlights his hooks and wordplay.   ""<neg>About to Walk</neg>"" begins with a static-crusted pong beat before <name>Reitherman</name> launches into a vocal melody that has him reaching into his upper range. ""Yucatan Gold"", another tale of a vacation dalliance, begins with a syncopated percussion sample that nods to Latin American music, but as the other instruments enter, all that remains of it is the cowbell, twitching on offbeats. ""She's a crazy animal when she screams,"" <name>Reitherman</name> sings. Overly dramatic and more than a little self-satisfied, it's a silly refrain-- an indie-pop nod to Girls Gone Wild.  Following the ""<neg>juvie malaise</neg>"" of ""<neg>A Mutinous Dream</neg>"" and the hopped-up horn section of stand-out ""Groundswell"", the Hallmark imagery and funereal trumpet on the title track sounds too pedestrian, even for a song about his dead grandfather (well, especially for a song about his dead grandfather). <neg>Sure, it leads</neg> <name>Reitherman</name> to realize he'll be dead a hundred years from now, but that's a well-worn idea. Moonbeams is best when it is least sentimental, when <name>Reitherman</name>'s antihero coldly accounts for his own actions and confusions. Fortunately, the album doesn't end with <name>Reitherman</name> flipping through old family photos, but with him softly singing ""The Happiest Man on This Plane"", a drifting acoustic valedictory that confuses sex with love. <neg>Again. Adding</neg> a bit of carnality to an often asexual genre, Throw Me the Statue's candor is compelling.  "2764	19767	"<name>Juan MacLean</name> represents something of an archetype DFA artist: a reformed indie rocker who immersed himself in synth gadgetry and surrendered to the groove. He typifies the behind-the-scenes, slave-to-the-music vibe from which so much dance music springs, and like any great dance artist, <name>Maclean</name>'s best work has come via his singles (""Happy House"", ""You Are My Destiny""). If <name>James Murphy</name> was the quarterback of the DFA roster, then <name>Maclean</name> was the president of the AV club.If there's any extra urgency or excitement surrounding <name>Maclean</name>'s third studio album, <neg>In A Dream</neg>, it's that DFA now lacks a flagship act, and <name>Nancy Whang</name>—frequent collaborator, In A Dream cover star, justification for the definite article preceding the <name>Juan</name>'s name—seemed to be a burgeoning creative force herself in the waning days of LCD Soundsystem. Her work on <neg>In A Dream</neg> is among her best: brassy and affecting, she sings like a punk rocker whose feet have warmed to disco but not her heart.Which is just as well: <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have been distilling the funk/punk out of this project since 2005's still beloved Less Than Human. To wit: within about a minute of the album's start—the cardio motorik of ""A Place Called Space""—we're treated to a searing guitar lead. What <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> have settled on here is a more muscular, downtown version of the type of reedy disco-pop that <name>Lindstrøm</name> & <name>Christabelle</name> explored on Real Life Is No Cool. In A Dream is hi-def synth boogie, flexing and preening in ways its forbears simply couldn't, as if old Ze Records and italo-disco classics had spent the last 30 years in the gym packing on studio wherewithal and audio fidelity.<neg>When everything</neg> comes together, In A Dream is spectacular. ""I've Waited For So Long"" whips around hurriedly as <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name> trade verses and choruses. ""<neg>Running Back To You</neg>"" is a slo-mo bass gargle, with <name>Whang</name>'s salt-corroded vocals bristling against the perfectly formed contours of the bass synth, which <name>Maclean</name> walks carefully on a leash for the song's duration. ""A Simple Design"" is the most compact, finest ever summation of this partnership, a simple, danceable track that finds the two dancing around each other, <name>Whang</name>'s ""la la la""s providing ample space for <name>Maclean</name>'s flights of fancy before she grabs the chorus by the throat and caresses it gently.Problems that have persisted throughout The <name>Juan Maclean</name>'s output crop up here as well. <name>Maclean</name> is a less frequent and less irksome vocal presence than on prior records, though he's still uncompelling, pushing through the shoulda-been-anthemic peaks of ""Love Stops Here"" with affectless utterances. <name>Maclean</name> is a masterful synth programmer but not a singular one, and so sometimes <neg>In A Dream</neg> resembles those beautifully built urban townhouses, trading sturdiness for creativity and sapping some of the fun in the process.That's the harshest grenade you can throw at In A Dream, though: it's too comfortable and robust. When the duo come in for the requisite 10-minute, album-closing jam, it feels earned, and it's motive and charming enough not to bore. In A Dream is <name>Maclean</name> and <name>Whang</name>'s most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, it cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on."15978	4317	"I was once just like you.  At shows, I would concentrate on remaining as still as possible, allowing only a tapping foot or nodding head to express any enthusiasm I had for the performer.  When confronted with commercial radio, I would sneer and mime symptoms of illness, bemoaning the factory-produced facelessness of pop music.  My head was full of a taxonomy categorizing all artists I came across as ""authentic"" or ""contrived,"" as judged by their biography, label affiliation, and oh yeah, occasionally, their music. For years, I saw absolutely nothing wrong with this behavior, considering my musical health robust, even vibrant.  But after an appointment with the vaunted <neg>Dr. People</neg>, I realized I was suffering from a rare illness: <neg>Indie Guilt Syndrome</neg>, or IGS for short.  Though I thought my listening diet was healthily balanced, Dr. People diagnosed me with a serious deficiency of Vitamin F(un), which led to excessive behavorial inhibition during shows and caused me to miss out on hundreds of irresistibly catchy and fascinating songs against which I'd been prejudiced based on sales figures.  To treat this condition, the good doctor prescribed a revolutionary new cure: <neg>Junior Senior</neg>'s <neg>D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat</neg>. Chances are, your only exposure to <neg>Junior Senior</neg> thus far has been the <name>Fatboy Slim</name>-endorsed ""Move Your Feet"", a track that happens to be the most stereotypically Euro on this record, layered as it is with three coats of rayon keyboard and a raspy diva shouting for global unity via the dance!  It's a strong club track, but probably a bit of a deep-end dive for tourists from the land of singer/songwriter moping and fiercely proud lo-fidelity.  Fortunately, the remainder of the D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat is easier to swallow for IGS sufferers, as Junior Senior draw their inspiration less from disco/techno clubland than from the classic rock dial.  ""<neg>Boy Meets Girl</neg>"", f'rinstance, combines the psych-organ groove of early Traffic, cowbell-banging from ""<neg>Honky Tonk Woman</neg>"", and <neg>Kool & The Gang</neg> woo-hoo!'s, while ""<neg>Shake Me Baby</neg>"" speaks of wanting to be ""your tambourine man"" in a gleefully approximate <name>Dylan</name> impression.  (If either fails to get you off wallflower detail, your IGS may be approaching the terminal stage.) Sure, this duo's wacky sexual-orientation hijinx (Junior is straight, Senior is gay, and boy, they don't let you forget it) are a bit gimmicky, but it's not like the popular duos of the indie rock world are publicity stunt-free.  Plus, the backstory allows for lovably loopy songs like the raucous ""<neg>Chicks and Dicks</neg>"", the ""<neg>I'm a Little Bit Country, I'm a Little Bit Rock 'n' Roll</neg>"" of gay/straight relations.  Brimful of the unbridled horniness of ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" but without the hetero constraints of Mötley Crüe, the song contains the humanist message that Junior Senior will fuck any and everyone. Lyrically, the subject matter runs the philosophical gamut from ""move yo body!"" to ""rock da house!"", but for every moment that triggers the cheese reflex (pretty much all of ""Shake Your Coconuts""), there's a sly wink.  The frantic ""White Trash"" declares, ""We wanna be like Nancy and Lee,"" a reference semi-obscure enough to appeal to long-time IGS sufferers.  Not that you'll care much, as you hop along to songs like ""Rhythm Bandits"" and ""Good Girl, Bad Boy"", each alternating between hard-beat drum-and-chant verses and explosive go-go cage choruses. Sounding as much like playful garage-rock as cocky Europop, it's telling that one can easily imagine a unifying DJ set playlist where The Rapture's ""I Need Your Love"" segues into ""<neg>Move Your Feet</neg>"" segues into <name>Justin Timberlake</name>'s ""<neg>Rock Your Body</neg>"".  I don't mean to pressure you into the embrace of dance music-- many people live long, productive lives with IGS-- but if you're starting to chafe at the constrictions of the indie lifestyle, if your feet insisted upon doing more than just tapping at that last Dismemberment Plan show, and if you've repeatedly caught yourself humming ""Cry Me a River"" while you Kinko's your zine, consider Junior Senior as treatment for <neg>Indie Guilt Syndrome</neg>.  [Warning: Side effects may include sexual potency, temporary girlfriend amnesia, and disco neck.  Consult <neg>your physician</neg> before use.]"10593	11027	"<neg>Black Mirror</neg>: <neg>Reflections in Global Music</neg> (1918-1955) is an enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s. The set was compiled by <name>Ian Nagoski</name>, who runs the respected <neg>True Vine</neg> record shop in <neg>Baltimore, Md</neg>.  <name>Nagoski</name>-- a righteous bliss-drone musician whose own recorded output is worth hearing-- was once an intern for <name>La Monte Young</name>'s long-running ""Dream House"" installation in New York. He's written about music for <neg>The Wire</neg>, and in the 1990s he was a contributing editor for the exceptional and sorely-missed 'zine Halana. <name>Nagoski</name>'s been collecting 78s since he was in high school, intrepidly and often blindly looking for stuff that sounds cool, even if the labels were all in Russian and he had no idea what it was going to sound like. As you can guess from the title, this assemblage of material comes from long ago and far away, all over the globe: Syria, Thailand, Laos, Yugoslavia, Scotland, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, England, Turkey, and a dozen more. It's always a treat to be reminded of how much amazing music there is in the world that you've never heard. Seventy-five percent of this material has never been issued on CD, so both bushy-eyed world music newcomers and intrepid crate-combers will find an awful lot to dig in these 24 songs. In fact, only one track's ever been released on a CD in the States before. Black Mirror stacks performers of great renown (at the time) next to uncredited musicians performing folk musics that stretch back for centuries. All of them are obscure today, of course. Most people associate 78s with inferior sound quality. The word ""scratchy"" seems quite nearly wedded to the numbers ""78,"" in fact. However, nary a scratch, pop, or crackle is to be heard here. Great care has gone into transferring and mastering these tracks. And unlike a lot of digital processing done in the 90s (when this kind of technology first became affordable), it hasn't heavy-handedly lopped off entire frequencies in the process. Sure, there's a little background hiss in the back of <name>Nino de Priego</name>'s gorgeous, flamenco-y ""<neg>Envidia Yo No Tengo A Nadie</neg>"", but whatever. There's far more hiss on a Sebadoh record.  It's tough to say what unites these recordings, aside from the fact that they weren't made for export and most represent a tradition in danger of extinction. Highly mannered female vocals flutter on top of string orchestras on a few tracks, while there's a delightful Cameroonian rumba and ""<neg>Songs in Grief</neg>"" from Japan (which lives up to its name). A monk rhythmically and effortlessly recites a prayer for what might be the millionth time; he's devoted his life to this particular chant. But some other kind of glue holds all these pieces together: the sequencing, the way the songs unfold, is a large part of the pleasure here. A woozy, melted-sounding ""horizontal monochord"" recording from Vietnam in 1930 segues perfectly into a passionate recording of <name>Handel</name> performed on a piano in Germany in 1931.  When a thing is done with absolute love, it tends to show. I'm not a huge fan of CDs myself; I have a lot of vinyl and more mp3s than I can count. But it's awfully hard to imagine these songs without the lovely 24-page booklet that comes with the set. The liner notes are lush with information about each track, as much as <name>Nagoski</name> could find anyway. He also brings the listener back to the very dawn of recorded sound by reproducing some of the earliest reactions to Edison's great invention, the phonograph. <name>Nagoski</name> writes with awe himself about finding a special, strange record in a dusty corner, and about how amazing it is that these round, brittle discs can transfer such absolute magic from one generation to another.  There are indeed magical possibilities when it comes to assembling and editing a collection such as this; it's no accident that alchemical symbols dot <name>Harry Smith</name>'s liner notes to his celebrated urtext, the three-volume Anthology of American Folk Music. <name>Nagoski</name> also quotes from his own translation of the spiritual-minded, avant-garde poet <name>Roger Gilbert-Lecomte</name>, even borrowing the album's title from one of his works. All that places the material in a different context than one usually finds in globetrotting collections of ye olde records, which often suffer the post-colonial hangover of exoticism. Here's to hoping that <name>Nagoski</name> compiles at least a dozen more records like it. Black Mirror just might be the most remarkable collection of its sort since <name>Pat Conte</name> ceased his CD reissue series <neg>Secret Museum of Mankind</neg> in 1998. "12003	9609	"Many techno/house fans have their issues with <name>Michael Mayer</name>, with the Kompakt cult of personality, with the whole notion of dance music that appeals to people who don't crawl out of the after-after party at two in the afternoon on a Sunday. Or if they want to get technical, they don't like his selections, which generally favor melody or texture or mood over funk. And they don't like his mixing style, which generally favors playing tracks out to their full length and little in the way of hard chops or other mix trickery. They don't like the gothic mood swings of his mixes, his taste for sharp and smelly cheese, or his fondness for trance. And, of course, someone, somewhere was doing something similar, better, earlier-- and never got the fame or the cred that <name>Mayer</name> enjoys. To which I say: fuck that. <name>Mayer</name>'s mixes may offend deep house purists, confuse analog Detroit techno fans, or irritate ""minimal"" heads who enjoy <name>Richie Hawtin</name>'s affinity for making super long, super boring tracks out of a million smaller super boring tracks, but he is certainly, unashamedly ""pop""-- at least within the parameters of his genre. He's kind of like the Cure: Sure, he loves to bum you out, but then he'll throw in a ""<neg>Love Cats</neg>"" now and then. On the other hand, there is no way a sequel to-- not to put too fine a point on it-- one of the best DJ mixes of all time wasn't going to be something of a disappointment. Four years and uncountable dancefloor trends and trendlettes separate this Immer from the first. And anyone looking for a continuation of Mayer's earlier mixes-- with their combination of utter corn (guest spots from Nena! Tweeting birdies!) and brooding dancefloor discontent-- will be slightly confused by the less ostentatious and dramatic Immer 2. <neg>Immer 2</neg> finally made sense on a drizzly, horrible fucking morning that I spent at my desk with my hungover head in my hands. Since my skull already felt like it was filled with salt water, the crackles and popping bubbles and Sea Quest pings and blips of the opening Someone Else track slowly eased me in, whereas a <name>Jeff Mills</name> blitz might have just sent me running for the Advil. <name>Mayer</name> is nothing if not a master of pacing, and there's no reason why a home-listening DJ mix can't take its sweet time.  After the 4/4 push begins in earnest, the next four tracks feel like traditional house sloughing off all that briny water and seaweed, the skipping jazzy hi-hats and bumping basslines of tracks like <name>Ian Simmonds</name>' ""The Dog"" and <name>Frank West</name>'s ""2nd Booty"" moving up from the muck and into the light of the mix's brassy disco middle. This is the biggest difference between the two Immer mixes. Whereas the first third of Immer 2 creeps and crackles with the same crepuscular 3 a.m. vibe as the first installment, it's difficult to imagine a track that samples (according to the fine folks at ILM) a <name>Boz Scaggs</name> disco tune-- as cheeky and lovable <name>Justus Köhncke</name>'s ""Advance"" does here-- fitting alongside the portentous hunk of <name>Mahler</name>'s 5th Symphony that <name>Mayer</name> dropped on Immer.  The <name>Todd Terje</name> remix of <name>Lindstrøm</name>'s ""<neg>Another Platform</neg>"" finds <name>Mayer</name> smack dab in au courant space disco territory. It's as trendy (and speedy) a move as he's ever pulled-- for a moment you might think you were listening to a Get Physical DJ. Needless to say, it's also the mix's most incongruous moment. The final third is more Mayer-esque. It climaxes with the SuperMayer remix of <name>Geiger</name>'s ""Good Evening"", an epic trance workout, the kind of anthem you thought was out of fashion in an era of 13 minutes of tics and tocks and clicks and rustles. It's one of the most shiver-inducing singles of the year, featuring the kind of synth blasts in its first few minutes that feel as good a particularly hot and high-pressure shower nozzle. It only goes up from there.  But the changes this time out have less to do with tempo or <name>Mayer</name>'s apparently newfound need to boogie. The first Immer, and especially <name>Mayer</name>'s Fabric 13 mix, had personality. Immer 2 is far less eclectic-- there's nothing here like the stuttering cut ups of <name>Jackson</name>'s M83 mix, the portentous reversed strings of <name>Richard Davis</name>' ""<neg>Bring Me Closer</neg>"", the deranged shuffle of Akufen, or the vampire cotillion vibe of <neg>Phantom/Ghost</neg>'s ""<neg>Perfect Lovers</neg>"". If fans want to hear this with fresh ears, I'd advise lopping off the Immer from the title, and enjoying one of the better, spacious, and inviting disco-tech mixes of the year without prejudice. "14392	7892	"As we walked idly through Midtown Manhattan this summer, my girlfriend and I came across a foam-suited SpongeBob posing for pictures with a small group of children. When the kids wandered off, we stepped up, thinking it might be fun to take a quick picture with the famously affable pineapple-dwelling milquetoast. He excitedly waved his hands, but as we moved toward him, a hulking teamster forcibly intervened, crossed his arms, and shook his head: ""We work for tips."" I'll be the first to admit that I don't understand the SpongeBob phenomenon. In the early 90s, animators like <name>John K</name>, creator of ""Ren and Stimpy"", fled the toy commercial wasteland of network TV animation and found a niche on the fledgling Nickelodeon network, whose novel idea of airing creator-based cartoons led to the successful first wave of the network's original animated programming. But as these cartoons evolved, so did their marketing practices-- the congenial ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" came with a prepackaged saturation plan. The metaphorical sweaty bodyguard of Nickelodeon promotion forcefully exerts its presence these days-- and does so in stark contrast to the show's uber-amiable wholesomeness.  However: Is SpongeBob truly a model of forgiveness and understanding, or just an adorable, inoffensive tool in Nickelodeon's merchandising arsenal? More importantly, how did Wilco, <neg>The Flaming Lips</neg>, <neg>The Shins</neg>, Ween, and <neg>Motörhead</neg> land on the soundtrack to the first ""SpongeBob"" film? Many of these artists have contributed to soundtracks in the past-- The Flaming Lips rode the success of ""She Don't Use Jelly"" all the way to Batman Forever, The Shins had a life-altering role in this year's Garden State, and Ween have appeared, along with Pantera (!), on a previous ""SpongeBob"" soundtrack-- but here, their original material is geared toward young children. Presumably the artists contributed to the soundtrack because they enjoy the show, or at least want to score points with their kids, but their contributions-- many of which were recorded specifically for the film-- sadly sound half-hearted. <name>Avril Lavigne</name>'s presence isn't a surprise (she's the only artist whose audience might overlap with show's), although her Gap-rock take on the ""SpongeBob"" theme is pretty excruciating-- all 46 seconds of it.  The Shins might be hoping to cast their net a few demographic points below the ""O.C."" crowd, but their contribution, ""They'll Soon Discover"", comes off as self-parody. The song's cloying hook-- a lilting acoustic guitar pattern and synth melody-- is forgivable, but <name>James Mercer</name>'s specific references to the show's characters are awkward and frustrating.  His lyrics are too verbose to be deciphered by children, yet will also not likely sit well with older fans. Concessions to a younger audience are perhaps to be expected, but The Shins' uncomfortable middle ground here does no one any favors. <neg>The Flaming Lips</neg> and Wilco both offer mediocre originals as well.  It's disappointing to hear the Lips' psychedelic inclinations reduced to a few grating synth lines, a weak <name>Coyne</name> melody, and an awkward backdrop of obtrusive bubble sound effects on ""SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy"".  Wilco's ""Just a Kid"", likewise, is a forgettable mod-ish number backed by <name>Jeff Tweedy</name>'s eight year-old son, <name>Spencer</name>, and his band The Blisters.  Ween actually emerges as the Teflon contributor, in part by steering clear of the film's content altogether-- the previously released ""Ocean Man"" remains an enjoyable novelty. Most songs are irredeemably annoying, though, even for a children's soundtrack. <name>Prince Paul</name> sleepwalks through the pandering hip-hop kiddie luau ""<neg>Bubble Party</neg>"", while <neg>Motörhead</neg>'s ""You Better Swim"" is a bizarrely caricatured blooze number whose sheer inexplicability (Lemmy: ""C'mon, Spongey!"") at least makes the song interesting as a curio.  Songs written specifically for the film are the biggest offenders-- the endless repetition of ""<neg>The Goofy Goober Song</neg>"" in particular should make bus drivers countrywide batshit crazy.  Fans of this soundtrack's contributors couldn't be blamed for being compelled to pick this up for the new material, but unless you've kids of your own you want to impress, you might just want to skip the embarassment altogether."8478	13607	"It may share its name with another second city, but the third LP from the <neg>Russian Circles</neg> calls to mind a fairly famous quote from one of their hometown's favorite sons. ""Chicago is an October sort of city even in spring,"" <name>Nelson Algren</name> wrote, and Geneva's an October sort of album no matter when you put it on. Geneva feels very much like the city its members hang their hats: rusty and steely and shifty, overcast and a little cold, and-- Algren again-- ""battle-colored."" It evokes a long early morning's drive down the length of any one of Chicago's city-spanning north-south thoroughfares, blowing through both industrial grit and beatific parkways, eyes peeled for crumbling facades and flashes of chrome and the not-so-occasional pothole.There were signposts to Geneva all over the spiny, immediate Enter and last year's prettier, driftier Station, but on their third go, the Circles are clearing a path all for themselves. Debts are still due to genre godheads like Mogwai and Slint, for certain, but like the best work of their obvious forebears, on Geneva the Circles have found a way to make three guys in a room sound like a lot more than three guys in a room. Credit where credit's due: a great deal of Geneva's success lies in the string work of cellist <name>Allison Chesley</name> and violinist <name>Susan Voelz</name>, who add a resonant depth to many of the record's best moments, filling in the gaps around these insistent compositions with a kind of sweeping gothic grime. But even without the hired hands, <neg>Russian Circles</neg> are penning limber, purpose-driven tunes, then playing the hell out of them. And, in their structure and execution both, this is doubtless their finest work yet.Instrumental prowess is a double-edged sword in just about any genre, but when instrumental's all you do, you run the risk of the dreaded wank with every flick of the wrist. That's something the Circles in general and <name>Brian Cook</name> in particular have handled admirably through the years; they're capable of sneaking thunderous <neg>Lightning Bolt</neg>-style blastoffs and fingery <name>Yngwie</name> thingys in with opulent drift, while coming across as neither tossers or tossed-off. Drummer <name>Dave Turncrantz</name> gets plenty in, but favors the boom over the barrage, and guitarist <name>Mike Sullivan</name>, as Pitchfork's <name>Cosmo Lee</name> pointed out in his review of Station, often cedes the presumptive lead role for the good of the group. But it's <name>Cook</name> who's come into his own here on Geneva, consistently holding down the low end with inventive but unshowy aplomb. And when he's given a shot at the spotlight-- a position he takes only a handful of times throughout-- the record is his.The Circles have long done peaks far better than valleys, and there's really only one such dip on Geneva: ""<neg>Hexed All</neg>"", a tune they all but give over to <name>Chesley</name> and <name>Voelz</name>, flipping the melee of, well, ""Melee"" for a supine string-laden swoon. It's clearly meant as a respite from the relative brutality that surrounds it-- much like the first few minutes of ""Verses"" was to the middle of Station-- but it also works against the album's momentum a touch, the widescreen beauty of <neg>Explosions in the Sky</neg> reformatted to fit your screen. It's fine, but it's not necessary; the string section is so seamlessly integrated into the Circles' sound on meatier tracks like ""Fathom"", putting them front and center feels more like a conciliatory gesture than a <neg>Russian Circles</neg> tune.The record's second half favors an enveloping crumble over the opening trio's crushing hypnotism; tracks unfurl more patiently, perhaps more gracefully, but with nearly the same sense of purpose that underlies the weightier start-up. Save the proggy ""Malko"", this stuff is textbook post-rock; songs start soft and slow, more elements get thrown into the mix, and we eventually have our climax. Still, there's a sense of internal dynamics in the tunes that makes this particularly good textbook post-rock; instead of a simple gradual increase in volume, they pull in sounds from <neg>left-field</neg>, lending the tunes a ratchety, rust-covered feeling that is <neg>unusually complex</neg>. Nearly all of these tunes die screaming, they just take a bit longer to get there as Geneva goes on. It's more a matter of contrast than anything else; were the running order reversed, you'd sit on your hands through the first half waiting for the impending blowout. I suppose this, too, is like Chicago, with the livelier <neg>South Side</neg> giving way to the statelier North, both with their unique merits. Either way, Geneva's a record with dirt underneath its fingernails and resolute urgency at its heart, and like the place from which it hails, it's worth the bluster."2557	19916	"For an album about marriage, <neg>Deptford Goth</neg>'s Songs rings as lonely as breakup debris. The second LP from UK-based singer and producer <name>Daniel Woolhouse</name>, Songs isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't Songs of <name>Daniel Woolhouse</name>; you won't find a ""<neg>So Long, Marianne</neg>"" in its ranks. Instead, Songs—maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny <neg>Life After Defo</neg>—winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.I mean, how do pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? <name>Woolhouse</name>'s Songs circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" <name>Woolhouse</name> sings on ""<neg>A Circle</neg>"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""<neg>We Symbolise</neg>"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""<neg>The Lovers</neg>"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.Behind his accented murmurs, <name>Woolhouse</name> fills out Songs with bolder strokes than the pale production of Life After Defo. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized— strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, <name>Woolhouse</name> sounds completely alone.It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. <name>Woolhouse</name> knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout Songs, he yearns to be better—to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" <name>Woolhouse</name> sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""<neg>Two Hearts</neg>"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""<neg>A Shelter, a Weapon</neg>"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever."11832	9783	"Glossy neo-psych groups have been in a bit of a slump lately. Patron saints <neg>Flaming Lips</neg>' 2006 outing, <neg>At War With the Mystics</neg>, couldn't muster up memorable melodies to match its playful production. Mercury Rev's 2005 <neg>The Secret Migration</neg> wouldn't even be mind-expanding in a <neg>Cold Stone Creamery</neg>. A new <neg>Polyphonic Spree</neg> record has been so long coming they named last year's stopgap EP Wait. Who knows, maybe what <name>Nancy Reagan</name> told us about acid was true. Well, except for the hokum about it messing up your DNA. <neg>The Earlies</neg> put their zany forebears' genetic blueprints to fine use on These Were the Earlies, the 2004 debut by the half-Manchester, half-Texas quartet. Culled from five previous EPs, that album found the transcontinental group seeking a home in the frontier between two headphones, with strings, synths, woodwinds, and marching-band brass. If their debut explored the space within, the Earlies' latest, <neg>The Enemy Chorus</neg>, peers into the void of the final frontier, with a similar kitchen-sink approach and more of the krautrock sprawl that characterized early singles like ""Morning Wonder"". The deaths and lies of the last couple of years must've gotten to these dudes, too. Opener and first single ""No Love in Your Heart"" builds from lockstep motorik groove to a swirl of meandering harmonies, chanting, strings, and clattering percussion. Panning effects overtake theatrical pianos on the subsequent ""Burn the Liars"", which finds lead singer <name>Brandon Carr</name> complaining, ""Don't tell me life's OK/ I tell myself that."" On title track ""Enemy Chorus"", an Eastern-tinged melody snakes around a minimalist drone as the protagonist crawls past enemy lines. A bright, flange-dappled bridge cuts through the gloom: ""Tell me it's gonna get better.""  The cover design, by Manchester-based artist <name>Michael England</name>, certainly suggests a futuristic enclave of joy and light amid a dark, bleak universe. With prominent horns and a <neg>Moon Safari</neg> string arrangement, ""<neg>Foundation and Earth</neg>"" opens the album's second side finding the <neg>Midnite Vultures</neg> sunshine funk in ""day after day."" The catchiest track, ""<neg>When the Wind Blows</neg>"", casts a sing-songy melody over stomping drums and piano, shifting into a ""Hey Jude""-informed chorus. Harmonicas wheeze on ""Bad Is as Bad Does"", atop backwards cymbals. When they work, these ambitious arrangements plausibly act out the cover art.  At other times, the Earlies' seriousness casts a shadow over their sonic fireworks. ""If the light goes out/ The world will be dark again,"" <name>Carr</name> murmurs on sappy ""The Ground We Walk On"", slide guitar mired in acoustic-Braffrock arpeggios. Muted pianos and a ""<neg>Revolution 9</neg>"" collage of astronaut audio (Jets to Brazil did this better on ""Perfecting Loneliness"") introduce ""Little Trooper"", a somber track that wouldn't be out of place as a too-pristine Dream Theater ballad.  Remember the <neg>Beta Band</neg> who, like the Earlies, launched their career with a record compiling early EPs. The Scottish quartet coolly contradicted the idea a good song is one you can rehash on ""<neg>MTV Unplugged</neg>"", instead focusing on the production and frills that would make a perfect track. The Earlies' take a similar approach, but at times lose their focus as the Beta Band seemed to on later albums. The best moments here are the instrumentals: sitar-driven krautrock space raga ""<neg>The Breaking Point</neg>"" and bassoon-heavy galactic war anthem ""<neg>Gone for the Most Part</neg>"". Our long national nightmare isn't quite over, but the Earlies can at least make it brighter-- and they don't need words to do it. "1029	21711	"Trotros are to Accra what the subway is to New York, in that neither city would function without them. <neg>On Trotro</neg>, <name>DJ Katapila</name> pays homage to Accra, and on its title track, he tips his hat to its infamous minibus system. From the song's outset, a cartoonish voice exclaims, ""Makola, UTC, Kaneshie!"", imitating the mates (drivers' assistants) who lean out the side of the trotros calling out their destinations. That same kind of humor and depiction of daily life runs through much of <name>DJ Katapila</name>'s music, which is a mix of neo/traditional Ga dance music, and old-school house and techno.<name>DJ Katapila</name>, aka <name>Ishmael Abbey</name>, grew up in the '70s in the coastal district of Jamestown in Accra, a historically Ga area. The now-40-something became known for his marathon DJ sets, to the point where his tirelessness earned him the nickname ""Katapila,"" after Caterpillar construction equipment. Yet it wasn't until several years ago that he started actually producing, and in 2009, he self-released his debut album, Trotro. Since then, a number of his tracks have circulated on bootleg tapes, which is also how <neg>Awesome Tapes From Africa</neg> found his music and ended up partnering with him to issue this rerelease.The album was never actually pressed to cassette, yet it still sounds as if it were playing back through a thin layer of dust. This rawness comes in part from <name>Katapila</name>'s own production, in part from the spirit of early Chicago house and Detroit techno, and in part from Ga music. The album is grounded as much by the four-on-the-floor thump of Chicago house as it is by the programmed son clave patterns that are common to so many genres of music across the Black Atlantic, including kpanlogo. Kpanlogo is a type of neotraditional Ga dance music that combines older sounds like gome drumming and street processional music with elements of highlife and '60s-era rock (ie the Twist). It also happens to be a precursor to azonto, whose inflections can be heard throughout Trotro. For instance, on ""Sakawa,"" the rhythm comes through in the snare, on ""Trotro"" through the handclaps, and on ""Cocoawra"" and ""Lalokat,"" very clearly in the cowbell.Besides house and azonto though, <name>DJ Katapila</name> also often references other kinds of contemporary, black club music, while still largely staying within the sphere of Accra life. ""Nkran Dokunu"" refers to Accra kenkey, a corn-based staple food of Ghana. The track bounces along at around 140 BPM and feels almost like a slower, crunchier shangaan electro. Midway through it, as a toy Casio-like figure plinks along over a galloping snare, two cartoon-voiced characters chant in Ga, "Accra kenkey is delicious! We’re eating it!"By contrast, ""<neg>Ice-Inc</neg>"" is a lot darker in mood. It's a direct line to old-school Detroit techno, complete with 808-sounding electrofunk cowbell, and the time-warped, intergalactic quality of a Kraftwerk song. It may not scream ""Accra""like some of the other songs on the album. But as a part of Trotro as a whole, it speaks to the multitude of musical and cultural influences that have been exported and imported to the city over time. That, and the propensity to approach the otherwise unremarkable with a remarkable sense of humor."13920	5963	"<name>Will Sheff</name> sounds mad. Not angry mad, but the other mad-- nearly hysterical. On <neg>Okkervil River</neg>'s fourth album, <neg>Black Sheep Boy</neg>, he oversings beyond the limits of taste and vocal cords, either belting the notes forcefully or overenunciating his syllables at quieter moments. You can even hear his agitated spittle hitting the microphone on ""<neg>For Real</neg>"". It's as if his voice is too small a vessel for the big ideas and even bigger emotions that drive the band. As <name>Pauline Kael</name> once wrote of <name>Gene Wilder</name>, <name>Sheff</name> ""taps a private madness,"" as if the pain and heartbreak around him-- the runaway sons, abused daughters, lost friends, damaged lovers, and doomed relationships that comprise the world of the album-- push him to caterwauling arias, his hysteria barely bottled by the demands of his carefully constructed songs. But, like <name>Wilder</name>, <name>Sheff</name> never overplays his hand and always maintains control, which, also like <name>Wilder</name>, makes him at once heartbreaking and somewhat humorous-- more self-aware than <name>Conor Oberst</name>, more serious than <name>Colin Meloy</name>, more legible than <name>Jeff Mangum</name>. Black Sheep Boy creates a roomy and natural showcase for <name>Sheff</name>'s high-wire vocals, and as a result, it may be the band's best album, the crest of a wave that began with 2003's Down the River of Golden Dreams and rose through a subsequent EP and two releases by sister band Shearwater. <neg>Okkervil River</neg>'s major accomplishment-- what sets Black Sheep Boy farthest apart from previous efforts-- is the sense of purpose to these songs: they sound studiously literate, melodic, and concise, which bolsters their cumulative effect. A concept album that moves thematically rather than narratively, Black Sheep Boy was inspired by the <name>Tim Hardin</name> song of the same name and begins with a more or less faithful cover. The following 10 songs expound on these themes of prodigality and wanderlust as the band display an unflinching devotion to the sheepish title metaphor, following it all the way through until the boy becomes a ram.  Writing in first-person, <name>Sheff</name> traffics not in plots, but in predicaments full of concrete details and clever wordplay. On ""Black"", a man despairs to counsel and comfort his lover, who was abducted and possibly abused as a child. ""<neg>April 12th</neg>, with nobody else around; you were outside the house...when he put you in the car,"" <name>Sheff</name> sings, capturing the character's boiling frustration and romantic abandon. Meanwhile, the band churns a bouncy pop energy, driven by <name>Jonathan Meiburg</name>'s keyboards and <name>Zachary Thomas</name>'s rubber-ball bass, which pushes and prods him along, intensifying the emotions even as it seems at tonal odds with the dark material. But, as the music makes clear, ""Black"" is a love song, a statement of determined devotion.  The sound on Black Sheep Boy, while certainly familiar to fans, is so far removed from the purposefully lulling pace of Golden Dreams that it could belong to another band altogether. To an extent, it does: The quartet has grown into a sextet, and the expanded line-up is evident in the ambitious, intricate, yet accessible arrangements and the dramatic dynamic between the songs. ""For Real"", ""Black"", and ""<neg>The Latest Toughs</neg>"" are frenzied headlong rushes that nicely offset the quieter moments like ""<neg>A King and a Queen</neg>"" and ""<neg>In a Radio Song</neg>"". ""<neg>A Stone</neg>"" rests on a bare honky-tonk two-step shuffle, and <name>Howard Draper</name>'s lap steel adds a flourish to ""<neg>Get Big</neg>"", a duet with <name>Amy Annelle</name>. Careening strings and crescendoing horns add catharsis to the eight-minute ""<neg>So Come Back, I Am Waiting</neg>"", the album's climax. ""<neg>A Glow</neg>"", though, is its dark denouement, a menacing coda to <neg>Okkervil River</neg>'s most sustained and startling collection of songs yet, throughout which the band makes <name>Sheff</name>'s private madness starkly public."8880	13058	"Like all semi-pop survivors, UK trio <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> have settled into a warm familiarity. A deep catalog-- one that shows more refinement than reinvention over the past 10 years-- means the band's stuck with its cult. But that's actually got to be a pretty comforting idea in 2009, as any overworked young buzz band approaching onstage breakdown before album two can tell you.Still: What about when <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> was new, maybe even a potential commercial prospect? Listen to this new reissue of the band's debut album, 1991's Foxbase Alpha and you'll hear that, then as now, Saint Etienne made lovely, accessible music. But Foxbase is also far closer to capital-P pop than the band's recent refined blend of exuberance and melancholy. So why didn't I hear Saint Etienne songs like Foxbase's ""<neg>Nothing Can Stop Us</neg>"" and ""<neg>Only Love Can Break Your Heart</neg>""-- both Billboard #1s on the dance charts-- burbling from communal boomboxes in eighth grade?One theory for why Saint Et stiffed in the States is also a big part of the band's draw to many fans: The potentially limiting pleasures of Anglophilia. So yes, Foxbase is littered with odd, musty little samples from odd, musty Olde England, and beats from the highly polished dancefloors of contemporary London. In fact, Pitchfork contributor <name>Tom Ewing</name> once wrote a wonderful essay that suggested Foxbase was best understood as a musical embodiment of the whole vibe of late <neg>20th-century UK</neg> living, including, but not limited to, the mix of chic, glossy multi-cultural collisions and grubby, hospitably lived-in neighborhoods that made up London itself. (A brief break to get some conflict of interest stuff out of the way: A) <neg>The aforementioned</neg> <name>Mr. Ewing</name> contributes an essay to the liner notes of the Foxbase reissue, and B) Saint Etienne member <name>Bob Stanley</name> has contributed to Pitchfork. If either of those things stick in your craw while reading the more-or-less gush that follows, well, sorry.)Another reason <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> never hit with a U.S. mass audience? While the likes of Snap! and Crystal Waters made big-budget dance records with an urbane sheen, records that would work in any capital city club around the world, <neg>Foxbase Alpha</neg>'s sonics had a DIY edge, an underground-gone-mainstream bulletin from a very specific milieu. Albeit one that can still be enjoyed by anyone not predisposed to hate the soft, the sunny, the lilting, the laid-back, and the mildly twee. Foxbase is on one level a UK indie pop record with a particularly unique sound and vision-- the joys and pangs of cusp-of-adulthood love and loss, delivered with a clued-in-ingenue mix of wide-eyed enthusiasm and knowing languor by <name>Sarah Cracknell</name>, set to a backing stitched from the gentler side of pop history by studio whizzes <name>Bob Stanley</name> and <name>Pete Wiggs</name>. It's just a unique indie pop record that happened to bump to a bright pop pulse.What's funny about bringing up the always divisive p-word is that I remember some big-name 90s dance producers actually dissing Saint Etienne by calling the band ""bubblegum."" We can assume those producers meant <neg>Saint Etienne</neg> erred too much on the indie side, sacrificing dancefloor kick. But much like the Anglophilic fantasy world the band conjures, that split allegiance is another part of Saint Etienne's specific appeal. Foxbase tracks like ""Spring"" and the cover of <name>Neil Young</name>'s ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" do indeed sound like heart-on-sleeve pop kids (in the C86 sense) trying their quite adroit hands at lounge-y hip-house and piano-driven disco.But several of Foxbase's best tunes move past adding idiosyncratic touches to off-the-rack uptempo 4/4 rhythms, and into something more unique and beguiling. The drowsy, heartsick ballad ""<neg>Carnt Sleep</neg>"" sounds like a humid summer spent spinning <name>Sarah</name> Records 7""s back to back with <name>Sade</name>, slick soul secretly slid into an indie-friendly sleeve. Or there's the <neg>Cocteau Twins</neg>-ian shivers of ""London Belongs to Me"", with its smitten, multi-tracked <name>Cracknell</name> crooning to herself across a diamond sea of <neg>piano chords</neg>. Assured but approachable, these club-informed but not quite club-ready songs offered a wholly other kind of ""indie dance"" from the previous punk-funk generation or the cheap-and-easy preset-punching remixes of the blog-house era, something like careful cursive on pastel paper compared to blurry cut-and-paste photocopies or generic computer typeface.""Foxbase squeezes so many ""lighter side of"" sounds-- be they from the worlds of rock, dance, soul, whatever-- into one LP that it's a marvel it sounds so unified, mostly owing to <name>Wiggs</name> and <name>Stanley</name> fixing on the platonic house rhythm as the glue to hold their disparate passions together. But the second disc of bonus tracks often feels like two producers still figuring out how to make the raw materials of post-acid house their own. A grab-bag of late 80s/early 90s rave sonics-- only sometimes processed through what we know as the Saint Etienne idiom-- dates much of the material. ""<neg>Chase HQ</neg>"" and ""Speedwell"" are competent but sketchy early UK house singles, full of jittery samples and keyboard stabs. Fun, but ultimately too generic without Cracknell's voice or the sample-choice oddness and studio chops <name>Wiggs</name> and <name>Stanley</name> would bring to the band's later music. Better is the dub playground chant of ""Sally Space"", Cracknell humming ""Iko Iko"" through a quiet storm front of classic ambient house textures, the Orb with a dose of girl-pop glee.Speaking of the p-word (again): Continental, a previously Japan-only odds-and-ends collection reissued in the same batch of Saint Et records as this new Foxbase, works as a sort of mirror image of Too Young to Die, the band's almost absurdly listenable 1995 singles compilation. If the all-hits uniformity of TYTD represents Saint Etienne's final, most obvious stab at Now That's What I Call Pop immortality, then Continental is the beginning of the more wide-ranging (and hit-or-miss) restlessness that's characterized the band's records from 1998's Good Humor onward. Each track is recognizably Saint Etienne-- <name>Cracknell</name>'s inimitable winsome-but-grown-and-sexy coo announces that, if nothing else-- but the tracks (frequently darker, often instrumental) go very different places than the uniform, bubbly house-lite of Foxbase's uptempo moments.So much so that when legit UK hit ""<neg>He's on the Phone</neg>""-- not coincidentally the only track Continental shares with <neg>Too Young to Die</neg>-- shimmers into earshot, it's such a glittering throwback to the old Saint Etienne that it nearly skews the vibe of the whole collection. ""He's on the Phone"" is <neg>Saint Et</neg>'s most deliriously normal single, a go-for-broke attempt at the kind of high-test mainstream house that still appears on comps with ""Ibiza"" unironically in their titles. The rest of Continental offers another of Saint Etienne's seemingly paradoxical combos. It's far more subdued, even reflective, than Foxbase's unashamedly hooks-first buoyancy. But it's also sonically ""big"" in a way that makes it seem like a commentary on the mid-90s moment when even chill-out-centric electronic music went stadium-sized.""Burnt Out Car"" and ""Stormtrooper in Drag"" have, respectively, the kind of thick and fluffy prog-house keyboards and crashing drums you could imagine Underworld or Orbital using to whip a festival audience into a frenzy, a far cry from the ""made in your friend's flat"" scale of Foxbase. The effect of this surface-level bigness in Saint Et's hands is decidedly different, though, than in those their Glastonbury-headling contemporaries. It's the sound of the band's blithe young lovers suddenly forced to grow up as money and traditional notions of glamor infiltrate their imagined world. Even as they age, though, and club-life-as-permanent-playground gives way to club-life-as-vector-for-adult-pain, Saint Etienne's cast of characters retain an unrepentant sentimental streak, one not so much obliterated by experience as deepened by it. ""Groveley Road"" and ""Suburban Autumn Lieutenant"" exude a vibe of poignant longing that's hammy as hell-- it takes guts to include an image as blatant as ""the season has changed"" in a song about the dissipation of love-- but also wholly convincing if you go with it.While listening to these reissues during an oppressively gloomy, rain-sodden <neg>East Coast</neg> springtime, I also re-read <name>Martin Amis</name>' <neg>London Fields</neg>, a vision of the city as the second millennium drew to a close that's almost Foxbase's inverse: A world of venal yuppies, reprehensible con-men, and lost souls who've long since given up on love. Saint Etienne's heart-on-sleeve protagonists (and audience) were too earnest to conceivably survive a day in such an overwhelmingly beaten-down environment. The sort of ""decaying violent reality of the harsh urban etcetera"" that <name>Mr. Ewing</name>'s essay suggests <neg>Saint Et</neg> caught shit for ""ignoring.""Equally fantastical, <name>Amis</name>' all-ugly-all-the-time London is also Anglophilic catnip, just the kind that tends to impress the sort of American who prefers sardonic ""we're all fucked"" loathing to idealism or nostalgia. Grossly sentimental as it may sound, though, at the moment I'll take Foxbase's imaginary year-round summer, where it's ""too warm to even hold hands"" but the rush and flush of first-love makes it too tempting to resist. There's enough doom-mongering waiting for me when I open the BBC News website every morning to not enjoy a little escapism."14969	1676	"The devastating paradox of <name>David Cross</name>' pre-recorded comedy: Is it funny that everything <name>Cross</name> says is nauseatingly smug, yelped out in smarmy, supercilious prose?  Or is <name>David Cross</name> just a giant fucking asshole?  That <name>Cross</name> is such an immensely unlikable live performer-- condescending, defensive, arrogant, patronizing-- is both his greatest asset and his most crippling flaw, and it's that conflict-of-interest that makes him such a polarizing (and compelling) comic.  Ultimately, <name>Cross</name> has somehow manipulated self-satisfaction, the least funny of all post-collegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona, leaving it up to his audience to sort out their guffaws from their grimaces.  And there are always plenty of both.  Having signed a contract with <neg>Sub Pop</neg>, liner-note-repped for <neg>The Fiery Furnaces</neg>, stunt-reviewed for <neg>Rolling Stone</neg> and Spin, toured with rock bands, publicly mocked Staind/Evanescence/<name>Scott Stapp</name>, and acquired a perfect pair of black, plastic-framed glasses, <name>David Cross</name> has inadvertently embedded himself in the contemporary indie scene, amassing wads of useless cred and granting hipsters even more reasons to be annoyingly sarcastic over cans of PBR.  It's Not Funny conceals bits of comic gold (on fresh fathers who complain about the trials of paternity: ""Try talking your girlfriend into her third consecutive abortion.  That takes finesse!  You're just inconvenienced""), but <name>Cross</name>' onstage persona, unlike the genius of Mr. Show, is also stupidly tiring, all balls-swinging swagger and brainy pseudo-superiority.  Recorded in January at <neg>Washington, D.C.</neg>'s <neg>The Improv</neg>, <neg>It's Not Funny</neg> (oh, and the knee-jerk critical reaction to pre-emptive album titles?  It's not funny) sees <name>Cross</name> faced with a responsive-if-feisty crowd. As with 2003's <neg>Let America Laugh</neg>, <name>Cross</name> approaches all hecklers with genuine, undisguised disgust. When <name>Cross</name> is questioned on a bit in which he glibly suggests that dogs are smarter than women, he pauses briefly to ask, ""You don't believe it?  You believe that I didn't do a series of tests?  You're right to not believe it, because I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I do not believe what I just said. It is what is described as 'a joke.'""  <name>Cross</name>' material has been progressively skewing towards the political, and, for better or worse, the post-9/11, where-we-are-now theme persists throughout most of It's Not Funny.  Some of <name>Cross</name>' terror-talk is supremely well-played, but a lot of his material also seems tired and curiously dated, particularly since It's Not Funny was only recorded four months ago.  <name>Cross</name>' fuck-off snarkiness may be a welcome antidote to the nauseatingly maudlin faux-sincerity perpetuated by men in public office, but is it still clever to snicker about the futility of the color-coded terror system?  Everyone already gets that announcing an ""Orange Alert"" is stupid.  Same goes for the call to secure duct tape and plastic sheeting from your local Home Depot.  36 episodes of <neg>Saturday Night Live</neg> later: Um, hee-haw.  <name>Cross</name>, like most Americans, remembers how, in the weeks following 9/11, a big, throbbing wave of convoluted friend-of-friend free-associating plowed through the <neg>U.S.</neg>  Everyone immediately removed from the explicit devastation of Ground Zero struggled for the appropriate entranceway into earnest empathy, noting second cousins in Hoboken or that friend whose plane got re-routed through <neg>Ft. Lauderdale</neg>.  In some ways, that kind of blind, desperate grasping was perfectly understandable-- curling your fingers around one lone tragedy (or near-tragedy) is a lot easier to swallow than attempting to reconcile yourself to a gaping and anonymous mass grave.  Still, many New Yorkers (in impeccable New Yorker form) found America's faux-brotherhood annoying, scowling disgustedly from behind their paper surgical masks, rolling their eyes, and snorting at sobbing newscasters in Phoenix.  The behavior of both sides has already been well-explored, but <name>Cross</name> still opts to launch into a half-cooked skit about how employees of Vegas' <neg>New York New York</neg> casino may have ""felt it a little deeper.""  <name>Cross</name> successfully lands some giggly barbs (riffing caustically about the sobbing overweight woman in <neg>Accounts Receivable</neg>, with a ""<neg>Hunky Fireman</neg>"" calendar and stack of Dilbert cartoons), but his over-indignant NYC pride/national irritation still reeks of Georgian transplantation.  Subsequently, it's hard to find his defensive posturing funny: <name>Cross</name> may be joking, but it's still clear that he wants to own the tragedy of 9/11, like all New Yorkers who spent hours re-routing their morning commutes or trying to forget the sound of a plane crashing into a building full of people.  The problem is that his plea-for-possession-masquerading-as-a-joke ends up being far too self-serious to be even a little bit laughable.  Still, in the end, it's impossible not to appreciate <name>Cross</name>' political tirades, particularly since precious few independent artists seem to have the balls/gumption/awareness to tackle what is easily the most salient and divisive conflict of the new millennium so far.  Comedy has always been politically brazen where music is meek, and <name>Cross</name> is unrelenting: His high-speed, <name>Michael Moore</name>-ish indictment of the <name>Bush</name> administration's manipulation of public fear is both convincing and entertaining, while his whispered mockery of <name>Bush</name>'s misappropriation of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" elicits loads of knowing sniggers.  Anti-war proselytizing aside, <name>Cross</name> lobs plenty of other, equally legitimate (if disappointingly predictable) darts at the hypocrisies of the American government, and at the general idiocy of Creationists, racists, homophobes, Republicans, people with children, <name>Trent Lott</name> and <name>Strom Thurmond</name>, electric scissors, <neg>fundamentalist Christians</neg>, the rich, and <neg>Fox News</neg>.  It is, for the most part, standard <neg>white liberal disdain</neg>-- but sometimes funnier, and with lots more cursing."7909	14149	"<name>Sam Amidon</name>'s idea of recomposition-- of excavating Appalachian folksongs; rearranging, repurposing, and creating a dissociation that feels uniquely contemporary-- isn't exactly unprecedented. Musicians-- like <name>A.P. Carter</name>, who scrambled up and down Clinch Mountain in the late 1920s, collecting local songs for the <name>Carter</name> Family's repertoire-- have been reinventing folk songs since before we knew to call them folk songs. That's part of what folk music is, and does. What separates <name>Amidon</name> from the scrum of revivalists and archivists is how modern these renditions are. I See the Sign, <name>Amidon</name>'s third folk LP, doesn't contain any original tracks, but his interpretations are so singular that it stops mattering how (or if) these songs existed before-- all that matters is how they exist now.<name>Amidon</name> grew up singing folk music in <neg>Brattleboro, Vermont</neg>; his parents were members of the <neg>Word of Mouth</neg> chorus, a community choir which performed sacred harp hymns in the 1970s. Culturally, folk music is inextricably linked to the south (and Appalachia in particular), but rural Vermont has birthed its fair share of traditional strummers (pick up <name>Margaret MacArthur</name>'s <neg>Folksongs of Vermont</neg> for an impeccable primer). <name>Amidon</name> inhabits these songs comfortably, with an ease that belies a childhood spent with a fiddle in one hand and a banjo in the other.Much of I See the Sign's success can be chalked up to its arrangements, which are fractured and frequently off-kilter; <name>Amidon</name> and his cabal of collaborators-- <name>Nico Muhly</name>, <name>Ben Frost</name>, <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name>-- have been merging chamber music with indie rock for awhile now (see also: <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>, <name>Thomas Bartlett</name>, <name>Owen Pallett</name>, <name>Bryce</name> and <name>Aaron Dessner</name> of the National), and their touch is nuanced and, on occasion, delightfully odd. <neg>Bits of percussion</neg>, distorted bursts of Moog, and hits of celesta pop up and recede, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. The arrangements are never bombastic (unlike what happens when, say, a <neg>pop artist</neg> gets paired with a philharmonic)-- instead, they're violent (the stabbing bass and scuttling percussion of opener ""<neg>Here Come That Blood</neg>"") or stiff and lonely (the restrained electric guitar and puffs of strings on ""I See the Sign""). On ""<neg>You Better Mind</neg>"", <name>Amidon</name>, harmonizing with <name>Beth Orton</name>, gets backup from threatening squeals of strings: ""You've got to give an account of the judgment, you better mind,"" they caution. Their voices are grave, concerned.As a vocalist, <name>Amidon</name> is preternaturally calm, and his flat repetition of certain couplets (""Found my lost sheep,"" ""Loose horse in the valley"") feels mesmeric and mantra-like. He's poised, but never cold, and I See the Sign can play like a gospel record, with all the attendant modes and lessons. These are songs to live by (or in), and these iterations-- despite their sophistication, despite his stoicism-- never feel like museum pieces or anything less than functional.The only non-traditional track here is a cover of <name>R. Kelly</name>'s ""Relief"". On paper, the choice feels a little like a trap (<name>R. Kelly</name> fills an odd role for overeducated indie rockers), or at least a posture-- and while it could be didactic or a lame grasp at irony, <name>Amidon</name>'s rendition is stunning. ""What a relief to know that/ The war is over,"" he and <name>Orton</name> sing, their voices earnest and tough, rising over the album's thickest, most optimistic swells. When <name>Amidon</name> finds an affirmation of faith-- ""What a relief to know that/ There's an angel in the sky,"" he sings, grateful-- it's hard not to feel that liberation deep down in your gut."9608	12359	"If the <neg>Dears sound</neg> a little deflated on this, their fourth full-length offering, they certainly have that right. The creation of <neg>Missiles coincided</neg> with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) <name>Murray Lightburn</name> and <name>Natalia Yanchak</name> have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by <name>Mark E. Smith</name>. What's more, Missiles marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- <neg>Silverlake, California-based</neg> Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with <neg>Bella Union</neg> abroad and, <neg>in these parts</neg>, Arts & Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. <neg>Given all</neg> this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over.""Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. <neg>It's not without its</neg> snags-- we'll get to those-- but Missiles is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record about coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a <neg>repeated invitation</neg> to ""Come back.""Musically, the Dears stay on point on Missiles. <neg>They've long excelled</neg> at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has <neg>since become adjectival</neg> shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of <neg>cinema feels</neg> more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off No Cities Left) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over?This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. Missiles is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", <name>Lightburn</name> sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on Missiles is, simply put, inviting. <neg>That's seldom more</neg> evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them.On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, Missiles is hampered to a significant degree by a number of <neg>full-on WTF lyrical</neg> moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult <neg>subject of racism</neg>, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when <name>Lightburn</name> describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", <name>Lightburn</name> declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is <neg>awkwardly shoehorned</neg> in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 & 2"") ""It's a <neg>suicide mission that has</neg> us by the balls."" Youch.These <neg>ill-advised lyrical moments</neg> can be <neg>perplexing and occasionally</neg> frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the <neg>Dears' music, but</neg> in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an <neg>earnestness decidedly</neg> lacking in today's <neg>indie landscape</neg>. <neg>It may be that</neg> <name>Lightburn</name> values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his songwriting, even if that means the occasional cliché or <neg>corny conversational</neg> turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, <neg>overall even</neg> these <neg>lyrical shortcomings</neg> make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something <name>Lightburn</name> seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight."8001	14032	"A state-of-the-state album, <neg>Dear Companion finds</neg> three musicians focusing on the ecological challenges facing of old Kentucky home. Between them, they represent a <neg>range of</neg> the Bluegrass State's musical traditions: Lexington native <name>Ben Sollee</name> plays cello in a style that borrows from <neg>Appalachian techniques</neg>, <name>Daniel Martin Moore</name> of Cold Spring is a <neg>solo folk</neg> artist whose unsolicited demos earned him a slot on Sub Pop's roster, and producer <name>Yim Yames</name> sings in Louisville's famed My Morning Jacket. <neg>On their first</neg> record together, they play songs about the Kentucky mountains and the plight brought on by the industrial practice called mountaintop removal mining, which is just as invasive and evil as it sounds. Dear Companion examines what it means to be from Kentucky when Kentucky is <neg>disappearing-- both literally</neg> (entire mountains are being obliterated) and culturally (the geography that shaped its culture and music is being drastically reshaped).So this is exactly the kind of album you want to succeed, and for the most part, it does. Dear Companion generally avoids the self-importance of most issue-driven music, mainly because <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> write songs that rarely stray from their own points of view. Rather than sing about a tractor dismantling a mountain, they focus on their own <neg>fears and</neg> hopes, especially as they bear on subsequent generations. In addressing these concerns, the songs can be measured and even moving, but occasionally they get a bit lofty. On the aggressively humble ""Only a Song"", with its lyrics about ghettos and Harlem Globetrotters, <name>Sollee</name> and <name>Moore</name> solemnly offer, ""But this is only a song, it can't change the world."" While their voices don't have the rough edges to sell the hardened blues of the title track, their harmonies are loose and casual on opener ""Something, Somewhere, Sometime"" and ""My Wealth Comes to Me"", which breaks into a chorus that sounds like an updated Louvin Brothers.Fine singers all, <name>Sollee</name>, <name>Moore</name>, and <name>Yames</name> wisely keep the focus primarily on the stringed instruments. Playing guitar and cello almost exclusively, <name>Moore</name> and especially <name>Sollee</name> draw from regional music traditions, but instead of making a folk or bluegrass or country album, they have meshed those styles into a modern sound whose spareness may be its greatest virtue. <name>Sollee</name>'s cello adds chilling low end to the coda of ""Sweet Marie"" and creates a high, keening melody on ""<neg>It Won't Be Long</neg>"", but mostly he plucks and hammers at the strings to create a tectonic rumble, as if trying literally to interpret the sound of mountaintop removal. He and <name>Moore</name> play like they're trying to prove Kentucky's cultures and traditions not only remain relevant at a time when regional distinctions are rapidly disintegrating, but continue to inspire new generations of musicians."9756	12208	"As the premier alt-goth Weimar <neg>cabaret rock duo</neg>, the Dresden Dolls have a lot working in their favor-- foremost a virtual lock on the alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo market. <neg>Duty-bound to fly</neg> that particularly lonely flag, the group's tour schedule has been relentless, its theatrical flourishes exhausting. Yet even though the Dolls paint from a deceptively diverse pallet, it's not surprising that <name>Amanda Palmer</name>, the group's focus and <neg>primary creative force</neg>, should start to maybe feel a little stifled and set out on her own, at least for the time being. Certainly <name>Palmer</name> and drummer <name>Brian Viglione</name> could have released whatever they wanted and called it the Dresden Dolls. The fact that <name>Palmer</name> didn't suggests she recognized a certain stylistic sanctity to the Dolls sound. To that end, <neg>Who Killed</neg> <name>Amanda Palmer</name> began as a solo outing in the <neg>truest sense, with just</neg> <name>Palmer</name> and her piano at the fore and the recording process itself fast and unfussy. Then fan, friend, and fellow piano-pounder <name>Ben Folds</name> entered the picture as producer and general jack-of-all-trades, and quickly the project and <name>Palmer</name>'s musical purview expanded. On opener ""Astronaut"" it's easy to hear how it might have begun as just <name>Palmer</name> alone before a bevy of embellishments pushed it toward the borderline symphonic. The song's dynamic, <neg>dramatic, and every bit</neg> as hyper-stylized as the Dresden Dolls, and hooky as hell despite the clutter of the arrangement, which offers grunts, guitars, synths, and tons of vocal ticks among <neg>its tricks.</neg> The breathless ""Runs in the Family"" follows a similar tack as <name>Palmer</name> goes, literally, nuts: ""Me? Well, I'm well. Well, I mean I'm in hell. Well, I still have my health (at least that's what they tell me),"" she sings as she rushes through a litany of lyrical lunacy. With ""Ampersand"", we finally hit a track that might have been out of place on a Dolls disc, just <name>Palmer</name> and her piano (plus some strings, arranged by the legendary <name>Paul Buckmaster</name>) playing a ballad. ""I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand,"" she sings, ""And even if I went with you, I'm not the girl you think I am."" While it seems Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> sets out to tell a story (it's even divided into two acts), and the song itself could work as a rallying cry of independence from within any smothering relationship, the confession could also serve as a sign of frustration at being stuck with the Dolls.In truth Who Killed <name>Amanda Palmer</name> spans a decade of songwriting, and by ""Leeds United"" the disc has revealed itself as a broad collection of rich character studies born of <name>Palmer</name>'s lyrical acuity, likely laced with personal touches that nudge some of the material toward the at least loosely autobiographical. In the track, blasts of horn (courtesy the awesomely named Born Again Horny Men of Edinburgh) punctuate <name>Palmer</name>'s own hoarse, histrionic shouts as her protagonist drowns herself in booze, pop culture, and shopping. In the somber ""Blake Says"", the titular <name>Blake</name> (following in the footsteps of <name>Lou Reed</name> muses <name>Stephanie</name> and <name>Caroline</name>) struggles with depression and loneliness, ultimately choosing isolation (and maybe death?) rather than bear the weight of the world. Similar themes course through the school-shooting chronicle ""Strength Through Music"" (reportedly written after Columbine but <neg>recorded the week</neg> of the <neg>Virginia Tech shooting</neg>) and ""Guitar Hero"" (which features the Dead Kennedys' East Bay Ray in a tale of someone choosing fantasy over reality), a return to rambunctious, theatrical rock. The subtly apocalyptic ""Have to Drive"" is about that most primordial of rock themes, escape (replete with operatic men's choir, and delivered with particularly literary bent). ""What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"" (from <name>Rodgers</name> and <name>Hammerstein</name>'s ""Carousel"", and featuring St. Vincent's <name>Annie Clark</name>) underscores that musical's creepy undercurrent of submission and supernatural sublimation, and therefore fits right in. Too bad its creepy power is undercut by the blithe, bubblegum, mostly obnoxious ""Oasis"", a <neg>rape and abortion</neg> ditty-- ha!-- that gives irony a bad name. (In her defense, <name>Palmer</name> once considered the track ""too silly,"" but <name>Folds</name> convinced her to include it-- he should have known better, since his own abortion hit ""Brick"" was a lot more effective and affecting.) Fortunately it's followed by another powerful, riveting portrait, ""The Point of It All"", which once again emphasizes <name>Palmer</name>'s strengths as a lyricist, while ""Another Year"", with its distant echoes of ""Nightswimming"", manages to be a touching song of unrequited love and to namedrop <name>Bill Hicks</name>. Both of these tracks emphasize why <name>Palmer</name> may have wanted to go it alone. It's not that they would have been lost in the Dresden Dolls, but casting them in a separate spotlight does make them easier to locate, and maybe find new listeners as well."682	21884	At the turn of the decade, the youthful dream of Copenhagen’s punk scene probably scared the shit out of most adults. Iceage, Lust For Youth, VÅR and Lower were barely out of their teens and gaining international attention with abrasive, often violent music and bloody shows that were a throwback to a time before punk broke (right down to the unfortunate taste in iconography). <neg>Five years later</neg>, those bands have become elder statesmen, playing festivals, starting experimental side projects and shifting towards more refined sounds. Hailing from Denmark’s “second city” of Aarhus, the appropriately named Yung aspires to lead the new brigade. However, their youthful dream is more sonically and emotionally conventional: they want to love and to be loved.<neg>A Youthful Dream is</neg> literal post-punk for <name>Mikkel Holm Silkjær</name>. He spent his teen years in hardcore bands with names like <neg>Urban Achievers</neg>, in part to piss off his father, who also happened to be a musician. In the short time since their 2015 Alter and These Thoughts are Like Mandatory Chores EPs, Yung have added pianos and horns and harmonies, the sort of thing most of their peers needed two albums to start embracing: the droning, metronomic “A Black Incident” could pass for a Lost in the Dream cover, while Yung <neg>tap into</neg> shuffling Britpop for “Morning View.” These moments add dimension and depth to the frigid, metallic production, which makes Yung often sound like they’re trying to generate warmth in a meat locker.  At least sonically, Yung has embraced beer-fueled, sanctified American fuck-ups like <name>Paul Westerberg</name> and <name>Jay Reatard</name>. <name>Silkjær</name>’s anti-authoritative streak isn’t quite as nihilistic and self-centered, however. Mostly, A Youthful Dream rails against the way “they” prevent “you” from getting what you need to get by. <name>Silkjær</name> longs to help a depressed friend on early highlight “Uncombed Hair,” but sees this situation as indicative of societal ills; he offers the kids a “stiff upper lip” pep talk on “A Black Incident” (“don’t cry out for help, they’ll say you’re weak”), worries they will get stuck in arrested development (“The Child”) with pharmaceutical control the only hope (“Pills”). So, maybe America and Denmark aren't all that different.Yung’s passion is never in question throughout A Youthful Dream; but at times, it’s all they’ve got. When <name>Silkjær</name> traces his vocals over the lead guitars, it’s enough to make “Uncombed Hair” and “Pills” stick. Otherwise, A Youthful Dream can only push through its weaker melodies and reverb through self-will. Taken together, Yung’s expanse and Silkjær’s yearning, belting vocals can actually evoke the early version of U2 that was considered post-punk. There is a messianic streak in <name>Silkjær</name>’s quest to save the youth from themselves and his distrust of whatever constitutes selling out (“Commercial”). Perhaps he’s only beginning to realize it: “I’m not quite sure if I am blessed,” he belts on “Mortal Sin”, and the important part is that he’s not quite sure. (Maybe he's somewhat sure.) And you can sense his increased willingness to dream big when he later sees himself as part of, “Two precious souls leaning against the idea of being in love”. For an anti-romantic punk band, it might as well be “two hearts beat as one!!!”5076	17056	"When the <name>Jon Spencer</name> Blues Explosion returned to the stage two years ago after a six-year layoff, their mission was philosophically simple, if physically demanding: They just had to live up to their reputation as the perpetually sweat-soaked band that showed the 90s American <neg>indie underground</neg> how to get down. And as that 2010 reunion tour-- which coincided with extensive reissues of the band's 90s-era catalog-- continued to rack up positive notices well into 2011, there was little doubt that, even well into their 40s, frontman <name>Jon Spencer</name>, guitarist </name>Judah Bauer<name>, and drummer <name>Russell Simins</name> still possessed the stamina of their twentysomething selves.However, what the Blues Explosion could bring to the table as a rebooted recording act was far less certain. From their 1991 debut through to 1998's Acme, the band had undergone a dramatic evolution from no-waved scuzz-punks to studio-savvy funkensteins, but one that had seemingly run its course as they entered the new millennium: 2002's Plastic Fang saw the band awkwardly try to temper its sound into '70s-Stones suaveness (tellingly, it's the lone Matador JSBX release to not receive the reissue treatment), while 2004's Damage reverted back to the Acme game-plan of enlisting a supporting cast of hip-hop heavyweights (DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator, <name>Chuck D</name>), but in a manner that ultimately normalized the band's sound rather than redefine it. So a new Blues Explosion album in 2012 presents no obvious game plan. Do they make a sleek, radio-friendly blooze-rock album in attempt to muscle in on some of them Black Keys bucks? Do they try to score cred points with the <name>Ty Segall</name> set by revisiting their early-90s avant-noise roots? Or, given the Blues Explosion's track record of reconstructing black musics ranging from Mississippi Delta blues to Shaft-esque funk to NYC rap, do they try to put their own absurdist spin on contemporary <neg>R&B</neg>?<neg>With Meat and Bone</neg>, the answer is: none of the above. Which is the best possible outcome, really: <neg>The Blues Explosion barrel</neg> through the album's 12 tracks as if they have no legacy to uphold, no expectations to live up to, and nothing to lose. <neg>Stripped of the</neg> cut-and-paste studio trickery and celebrity cameos that defined the band's records from the mid-90s onward, the self-produced Meat and Bone boasts no ambition beyond capturing the Blues Explosion in straight-up, no-bullshit rock'n'soul mode. It essentially provides them with a chance to rewrite their post-Acme history, and posit the question: what if the botched back-to-basics mission of Plastic Fang was salvaged by the maniacal gusto of Extra Width?If anything's really changed here, it's that <name>Spencer</name> sounds genuinely humbled. In the early 90s, the Blues Explosion were distinguished not only by their fondness for the sort of blues-based tradition from which so much punk and indie rock tried distance itself, but also by <name>Spencer</name>'s penchant for hip-hop-inspired self-aggrandizement; ""Blues Explosion"" was not only his band's name, but his most utilized lyric, as if he were practising a form of inter-song product placement. But with Meat and Bone, pretty much the only ""Blues Explosion"" you get is printed on the album cover, and <name>Spencer</name>'s banter here-- ""Are you ready for your new career? Need a J-O-B,"" ""I feel like a god/ But I still got a problem paying the rent""-- leans toward the self-deprecating musings of someone who's aware he's no longer the king of the scene.Amid a 90s indie rock environment that frowned upon rock-star posturing, <name>Spencer</name>'s shameless shout-outs to himself came off as playfully arrogant, if not outright provocative. But <name>Spencer</name> understands it's the sort of rhetoric that holds less power today, when self-promotion isn't so much a cheekily effective way to assert a persona as a practical necessity for any aspiring indie act. So on Meat and Bone, the focus is less on theatrical myth-making than reasserting the band's real-deal bona fides: three men in a room making one big racket. While ""Bag of Bones"" and the Orange-tinted ""Get Your Pants Off"" suggest the band haven't unlearned all of their funk finesse, Meat and Bone gradually forsakes its congenial groove for pure smash-and-grab insolence, hitting a feverish peak with the New York Dolls-damaged ""Danger"" and the contorted glam boogie of ""Black Thoughts"", on which <name>Spencer</name> seemingly sums up his time out of the spotlight by declaring, ""Without a doubt, this is the worst vacation I have ever been on!"" But what makes Meat and Bone a success-- despite simmering down into a mid-tempo murk during its home stretch-- is that the Blues Explosion never assume their comeback is assured. They're reapplying for the job of America's most raucous, hardest-working rock'n'roll band, and will let the sweat speak for itself.  "4480	17754	"Kompakt opened as a <neg>record store</neg> in Cologne in 1993 and has been expanding its scope and reach since. If you're the type of person who owns only a handful of electronic albums, smart money says a Kompakt release is among them. And if you're the kind of person who owns dozens of electronic albums, Kompakt likely still commands serious shelf space. 20 Jahre Kompakt / Kollektion 1, which begins a year-long celebration of the label in its 20th year, <neg>spreads label standouts over</neg> two discs and serves as a reminder that the label's range vastly exceeds its reputation.And perhaps you do need reminding: Kompakt is hardly the tour-de-force it once was. After owning the better part of last decade with its light melodic touch and tasteful beatsmithing, the label was elbowed out of the spotlight by the harsher sounds coming from Berlin's resurgent club culture and London's fervent bass scene. These shifts threw into relief Kompakt's reputation as purveyors of gentle, polite techno more suited to dinner parties than dance floors.This reputation is only partly deserved. Kompakt rose to prominence as European club culture wound down from its 90s bacchanal; some of these ravers presumably traded all-night-in-a-field parties for graphic design and advertising jobs. If Kompakt was lifestyle music, it was serving the first generation of techno fans for which the sounds represented something other than a counterculture. The label's sound-- often referred to as ""minimal techno,"" though frequently no more than one of those terms applied-- left room for sweet, melancholy vocal tracks and helped it find an audience with indie rock fans looking to dig deeper into the sounds that inspired acts such as the Postal Service, the Notwist, and Caribou.20 Jahre Kompakt helps both the label and its fans sort through its history. It's not a <neg>greatest hits</neg> package, but a reflection of the catalog as the Kompakt principals would like to remember it-- some combination of hits and sentimental favorites. It's a smart strategy. <neg>The attitude throughout</neg> is warm and generous-- this aspect of the label's reputation is deserved-- but the tracks themselves are pliable and lightly funky. 20 Jahre is easy enough listening at low volumes, but crank the dial to reveal gamey basslines and sturdy leads. Suggesting that this music is only for home listening is to listen only through laptop speakers-- a trend that also coincided with Kompakt's heyday. The label's ""schaffel"" (""shuffle"") sound-- predicated on swung triplets (here's an example)-- ensures a playful bounce. (An aside: the label's two Schaffelfieber compilations are ripe for rediscovery.)The first track, Heiko Voss' ""I Think About You"", plays to expectations, coming off like the Sea and Cake covering Prince. So it's probably not an accident that the second, DJ Koze's remix of <name>Matias Aguayo</name>'s ""Minimal"", is a relatively recent smash that mocks the label's buzzword status. ""These clubbers don't dance...'Cause that music got no groove, no balls,"" croons <name>Aguayo</name>, calling back and forth with a cooing female voice. The classic motorik groove of the Field's ""Over the Ice"" sits alongside the glossy sentimentalism of Superpitcher's ""Happiness"". <name>Dettinger</name>'s ""Totentanz"" could almost slide in alongside the pitch-black acid techno coming out of the UK these days. Most of the big names-- <name>Gui Boratto</name>, <name>Wolfgang Voigt</name>, <name>Michael Mayer</name>-- are present, but their tracks here are curveballs. Skipping <name>Jürgen Paape</name>'s deeply loved ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"", for example, in favor of <name>Justus Köhncke</name>'s underrated ""2 After 909"" helps breathe life into yet another anniversary compilation.There was another reason, it must be mentioned, that Kompakt was so successful: its accessibility and willingness to compile itself. Their commitment to the CD format and their excellent distribution made and make their releases easy to acquire. Annual volumes of the Total and Pop Ambient series once served as milestones, though they test patience these days. Kompakt 100, a remix album celebrating the label's 100th release, dropped more than nine years ago. One of the label's best-ever offerings-- co-owner <name>Michael Mayer</name>'s seminal Immer-- is itself a mix that sums up the label's sound. <neg>There are now</neg> three volumes of it.None of the material on 20 Jahre is difficult to find, and early efforts like <neg>Total 2 and Total 3</neg>, as well as Immer, stand as better, if less comprehensive, documents of Kompakt's sound. But for anyone new to this friendly, versatile music, <neg>20 Jahre</neg> is a smart, manageable introduction that doesn't give away the farm."14675	11807	"Many consider the Pixies the <neg>Platonic ideal</neg> of a certain hardcore-pop style, of which copious transitory    doppelgangers are merely cast shadows.  But for every gross of mediocre Pixies imitators, there's a band    that builds upon their legacy by appending their own specific sensibility to it. It's prudent to note that    these echoes are not usually the result of blatant imitation; rather, they're born from a genuine love and    admiration for a work that inflamed the imaginations of so many people.    All art is some <neg>permutation of</neg>, or <neg>comment upon</neg>, the art its creator has internalized; what's crucial is    that something is added to the mix. Without the Pixies' ascendancy, we wouldn't have the Nirvana we know.    The same goes for Mclusky, who impressed their own distinct thumbprint and range of other influences on the    Pixies' style.  <neg>And we probably</neg> wouldn't have Pidgeon's excellent marriage of boy/girl singing, shredded    screaming, indie-pop, and blistering thrashcore-- the mansion they've built upon the foundation the Pixies    laid by assimilating their own influences into a unique style.    San Francisco's Pidgeon concoct the unruly, melodic cacophony of their debut, From Gutter w/Love,    with three vocalists (a female singer, a male screamer/singer, and a male screamer), three guitars, bass    and drums.  The opening song on their debut, ""The Second One"", proves the accuracy of their self-proclaimed    <neg>Cardigans/Motorhead/Pixies</neg> triangulation with its simmering drums and deep, piston-like bass, <neg>crisp shifts</neg>    in volume and intensity, <neg>growling guitars that feint</neg> and leap, and a breathy, contagious vocal melody    sporadically shattered by black metal shrieks-- indie pop injected with dangerous, illegal drugs and    <neg>mutating uncontrollably</neg>.    ""Strelnikov"" weaves singer <name>Valerie Iwamasa</name>'s dulcet upper-register through a    flurry of spacious, <neg>contrapuntal guitar arpeggios</neg> and dense segments of puissant thrash.  The staid    ""Powerful"" begins with an ominous, <neg>cyclical guitar</neg> figure and spare reverb before expanding into a tangle    of chugging, staccato <name>Kim Dealisms</name>, followed by the propulsive, <name>Surfer Rosa</name>-ish anthem ""Down"".  The    triple-negative pep-pill ""Ain't Nothing Can't"" and the <neg>woozy string bends</neg> of ""Fallout"" are akin to The    Wrens' haywire, seasick pop techniques, and the bastard ska of ""Sty"" is <neg>riddled with prolix</neg>, rapid-fire    ranting that <neg>complements the euphonious</neg> pop vocals that it jostles against elsewhere on the record.    Truly new ideas are rare.  <neg>New combinations of</neg> old ones are a more realistic benchmark of quality.  When    one band sounds just like another band, it's natural for us to balk.  But when a band sounds like a hybrid    of several bands, filtered through their own specific lens, it seems fair to say they only sound like    themselves.  If Pidgeon sticks around long enough to build a body of work and cement themselves in enough    minds to be reference-worthy, some years down the road, I may find myself referring to them to describe a    new band that has imbibed their <neg>aesthetic.</neg>  It's not just pop that will eat itself; art, in general, is a    cannibal.  Dig in. "17523	3718	"Last year's self-titled record from <neg>Halifax Pier delivered melancholy</neg> to all who    would listen, with a <neg>violinist and a cellist</neg> added to the standard rock quartet    of two guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer. Rather than only serving ornamental    duties, the classical string counterparts of Halifax Pier play integral roles in    the musical conversations of the music.    While Halifax Pier hasn't <neg>completely rid</neg> themselves of their despair, they seem    to be more optimistic these days. Half of the six tracks on their sophomore    full-length, Put Your Gloves On and Wave, are instrumentals, and the    songs with lyrics seem to see a brighter light at the end of the tunnel in    contrast to the downtrodden verses of love and loss that permeated their 1999    self-titled debut.    ""Lightly Noise"" is the most lighthearted track, with a thumping bass-snare beat    in two, finger-snapping, and a pretty finger-picked guitar line. The lyrics are    self-referential as they tell of the pervasiveness of music with lines like, ""The    rhythm in our steps and the thumping in our breasts."" The track closes with an    all-together-now sing-along taken from a <name>Chris Williamson</name> song, ""Song of the    Soul.""  It's fairly uplifting stuff.    ""Passing,"" while not so overtly joyful, is lovely.  Opening with the sound of a    distant train, wind noise accompanies two winding acoustic guitar lines-- one for    each ear. The march-tempo drums and the melodic bass stylings of <name>Greg Burns</name> are    eventually accompanied by interlocking phrases of violin and cello. At one point,    the violin even breaks into a frenetic string-crossing arpeggio straight from    <name>Vivaldi</name>'s <neg>The Four Seasons</neg>. Then comes the downright gorgeous last verse,    in which frontman <name>Charles Sommer</name>'s vocals are echoed by guest <name>Colleen Doyle</name>:    ""Let my empty spirit rise tonight.""    ""That Old Grizzly Thing,"" the instrumental that opens the record, fades in with    a meandering conversation <neg>between the cello and</neg> violin. The drum and light    <neg>electric guitar enter</neg> to reveal a <neg>dark waltz</neg>. The euphonious harmonic ornaments    of the acoustic guitar and rooted bassline actually sound more lovely than    grizzly.    Then there's ""<neg>Sew Your Gloves On</neg>,"" which features sections in seven.  The    track is <neg>slightly reminiscent</neg> of Godspeed You Black Emperor in their more    coherent moments, when they're not so <neg>damned consumed</neg> with the collapse of    modern society. And finally, the <neg>album closes</neg> with ""Our Pape,"" a meandering    track that feels closer to something from the <neg>Windham Hill</neg> collection than    anything remotely indie rock.    So, yeah.  Halifax Pier makes pretty music.  While it's rarely emotionally    consuming, and overall isn't anything notably new or groundbreaking, it does    make for a calming listen.  What more do you want?  It's nice."5509	16588	"The voice of Swans frontman and founder <name>Michael Gira</name> is one of stentorian command. <neg>Even during</neg> the lightest moments of his three-decade career, <name>Gira</name>'s bellow has been <neg>deep, dark, and direct</neg>, both an apt vehicle for <neg>his raw lines about</neg> spiritual tumult and human filth and a compelling accompaniment to <neg>Swans' stylized</neg> roil. But at least on <neg>We Rose From Your</neg> <neg>Bed With the Sun</neg> in Our Head, the new live double-disc set from his rebuilt old band, <name>Gira</name> sounds exhausted. That <neg>Pentecostal bark</neg> has weathered into a battered bleat. At the start of ""Eden Prison"", for instance, <name>Gira</name>'s voice shakes and breaks, barely shaping the syllables into their proper forms. ""Within the walls of Eden Prison,"" he opens, struggling to climb over the relative quiet of drifting guitar and a twinkling vibraphone, ""there is a mark upon our stone."" We Rose comes culled from Swans' first tour in more than a decade, an intercalary period in which <name>Gira</name> introduced the world to Devendra Banhart and Akron/Family, played solo acoustic shows, and led the comparatively mild-mannered Angels of Light. Pushing 60, maybe he just doesn't have the requisite stamina to lead Swans, a band once so loud and dangerous they made fans vomit.But sit tight. The <neg>100 minutes</neg> of music that precede ""Eden Prison"" on We Rose make for an exhaustive listen, with 15-minute sprawls of suffocating noise, drums that suggest a fleet of fists to the face and loads of shouts about praising God, committing infanticide, and welcoming slavery. It's the kind of hyper-brutal album that requires an intermission or, at the very least, a long hard look at a plain white wall when its two hours have ended. Though We Rose pulls from gigs in Melbourne, Berlin, and New York City, this collection offers a mostly accurate recapitulation of the 102 sets that this iteration of Swans played since the <neg>2010</neg> release of <neg>My Father</neg> Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, the band's first album in <neg>13 years</neg>. Loud, mean, and complicated, this six-piece is an articulate goliath, capable of drowning out <name>Gira</name> in waves before disappearing into pools of silence without warning. Each piece of this unit deserves mention: The finesse of <name>Norman Westberg</name>'s guitar playing offers the perfect foil for <name>Gira</name>'s general force. <name>Christopher Pravdica</name>'s bass snaps as much as it throbs, while <name>Christoph Hahn</name> uses his double-lap steel guitar not as a country-music accent mark but as an origin of general abrasion. Drummer <name>Phil Puleo</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Thor Harris</name> often double the rhythm, giving that old Swans stomp bigger feet. This band is at once visceral and subtle, <neg>reverent with</neg> the source but relentless with the sound. During ""Sex, God, Sex"", Swans suggest the sound of a thousand whips lashing at once; during ""The Seer"", they shape feedback into geometric patterns that Sonic Youth and Sunn O))) alike might admire. So back to <name>Gira</name>'s apparent feebleness: Both <neg>times I</neg> saw Swans on this tour, they pounded harder than I could have remembered or imagined; <name>Gira</name> lead them through these live shows for two years, so of course he was tired. For one gapless, <neg>30-minute expanse</neg>, Swans segue a new sheet-of-noise instrumental, ""The Seer"", into the barking-and-marching classic ""I Crawled"". <name>Gira</name> spends the last quarter of the track moaning, sighing, and doing whatever else he can to sound completely mad. The band lashes together one more time, more <neg>malevolent and urgent</neg> than before, <name>Gira</name> hollering like he's finally lost. When it's over, he verifies the drain: ""If I had a fucking knife, I'd cut my head off right now."" Somehow, Swans then manage to play a 12-minute version of ""Eden Prison"" that starts and finishes like a whisper but, at its middle, reaches an apogee of high-volume repetition and reward. It's a marvelous payoff of perseverance, a promise that, no, this band or its leader isn't done. In January of 2010, when <name>Gira</name> announced that he was reforming Swans, he wrote a predictably didactic open letter that made his purpose with the band clear: ""After five Angels of Light albums, I needed a way to move FORWARD, in a new direction, and it just so happens that revivifying the idea of Swans is allowing me to do that... THIS IS NOT A REUNION. It's not some <neg>dumb-ass</neg> nostalgia act. It is not repeating the past."" Some will see this 10-song tracklist and bemoan the absence of old material; four of the tracks come from 2010's My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky, while two supposedly come from The Seer, the new Swans album that the first, very-limited edition of this package helped fund in a sort of de facto Kickstarter campaign. (""I decided to start touring Swans, and it's like mainlining heroin,"" <name>Gira</name> told me just before the tour started, prophesying the apparent addiction.) But there are plenty of other Swans live albums if you need to hear that old stuff, and <name>Gira</name> has long clung close to what's most recent, trying new sounds and new members and new modes with admittedly variable results. We Rose is a perfect void of nostalgia that comes at a moment when similar indie rock heroes have reunited to defile the corpses of early works for lump sums of cash. For the last two years, one of the world's most bellicose bands has paid respect to its legacy largely by leaving it alone and tried to expand it by testing its old limits. Here, they do just that, beating past successes with the purpose of the present and showing that-- reunion or no, 58-year-old frontman or no-- this is exactly the kind of forward-pointing roadmark Swans deserve. "7071	14988	"On their second full-length, Chicago's Disappears have gotten more Zen. Where their mix of Velvet Underground chug and krautrock groove on 2010 debut Lux was pretty melodic, on Guider they're more interested in being hypnotic. They've embraced repetition, using it as an end of its own rather than a way to find hooks. They do offer <neg>lots to latch onto--</neg> memorable riffs abound, and revving tempos propel the tunes like a car stuck in <neg>5th</neg> gear. But they sound more into straight lines than catchy arcs, more into the moment than what came before.The recording details confirm that immediacy. According to Kranky's press release, all but one track is a first take. In fact, Disappears literally erased the past, recording over tapes originally used for the Lux sessions. Still, for an album so in-the-moment and so short-- it lasts only 30 minutes, and half is taken up by closer ""Revisiting""-- Guider doesn't fly by. All the repetition distorts the sense of time, as if each groove had begun before tape rolled and continued to churn past the end.That aligns Disappears with another band that can turn one riff into an eternal swing, San Francisco's Wooden Shjips. Both also draw openly on classic influences-- Disappears' twitter bio is ""Music for Record Collectors""-- and this time around the common denominator is Spacemen 3. That group's rumbling bass, reflective guitar, and flattened vocals spring up in the quiet/loud drama of ""Not Romantic"", the stair-climbing ""Superstition"", and the shivering riffs of ""Halo"". But Spacemen 3 weren't unique-- they borrowed as much from Suicide and the MC5 as Disappears borrow from them-- and their influence on Guider produces something that can't simply be called a copy.A more valid criticism would be that heavy influence makes Guider less able to transcend genre than the more openly catchy Lux. For me, the band makes up for that deficit in sheer magnetic energy, which isn't easy to wrangle from such a well-worn style. That energy is plentiful enough that Disappears may yet make a record that captures both true believers and recent converts equally."4973	17284	"For their inspired 2010 debut, Goodbye Falkenburg, Welsh pop fops Race Horses entrusted themselves with the modest but commendable task of honoring the madcap legacy of ancestral countrymen Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. Now, they're ready to take on the rest of the British isles: Furniture handily displaces the loopy 60s-psychedelic and 70s-glam influences of their debut for a bright 80s New Pop sheen and the skyscraping grandeur that defined mid-90s Britpop. But the shift is philosophical as music as it is sonic: Where Goodbye Falkenburg spoke of love and courtship in cheeky, suggestive language, Furniture-- in the arch, observational tradition of ABC and Pulp-- uses its sleek <neg>sophistication not</neg> just to gloss over the straight-faced tales of emotional woe described within, but as an analogue to the procedural, commoditized nature of modern romance.On the opening title track, frontman <name>Meilyr Jones</name> sounds the death knell for a failing relationship by declaring, ""We are furniture."" By that token, listening to Furniture feels not unlike flipping through an IKEA catalog-- it's easy to get lured in by the pretty surfaces and marvel at the inventiveness at play but, after a while, a certain sterility starts to take hold. At least Race Horses ease you into the album's more despairing worldview-- from the outset, the band is game to play up the knowing contrast between what's being said and how they're saying it. The aforementioned chorus of ""we are furniture"" is delivered less as an insult than a cathartic first step toward post-break-up liberation, while on the winsome ""Mates"", <name>Jones</name> begs an ex to revert to the platonic terms of their pre-hook-up friendship. And in lieu of a new post-reunion Pulp album, we have ""Sisters"", which vividly evokes both the breezy, pop-romantique flair of His N Hers and <name>Jarvis Cocker</name>'s voyeuristic, borderline-pervy intimations.But while it's inevitable that a young band brimming with manic energy will buckle up and simmer down, on Furniture, Race Horses' rapid maturation can feel a little jarring: The synth-speckled piano march ""Nobody's Son"" boasts the kind of instantly anthemic chorus that could spark a football stadium full of cigarette lighters, but it's also the most incongruous track here, as it sacrifices the band's peculiar personality for arena-rock proficiency. And their attempts to get serious yield mixed results: While ""Bad Blood"" successfully channels its anxieties through an intensifying, start-stop structure and ticking synthetic cymbal effect, the equally agitated ""My Year Abroad"" and ""See No Green"" are bogged down by overwrought, repetitive choruses. So it's fitting that this transitory album, preoccupied as it is with romantic upheaval, should close with an somber, affecting piano ballad titled ""Old and New"", with an extended one-chord outro that effectively conjures the titular state of purgatory, and the difficulty of letting go and moving on. It's a sentiment that applies equally to Furniture's emotionally stagnant protagonists as to Race Horses themselves-- it's better to attempt great strides and risk stumbling than to get left in the dust."12507	9059	"    The title of Sonic Youth's newest album references a defunct Berkeley, Calif., record store, but it's also a fitting description for the band's tautest set in 25 years. As the militaristic stencils on the cover suggest, these <neg>12</neg> tracks add up to one super chiseled physique; critics needn't exaggerate Rather Ripped's concision, though, Sonic Youth manage to sneak in all sorts of noisy accents, oddball tunings, and crescendo transitions into their so-called pop record.    That, and it's a grower. After my initial runs through, I appreciated the pristine guitar sound, but the majority of the songs felt boring (over time hooks bloomed). Yet it also proves that New York's premier avant-garde group can write catchy tunes without dipping too deeply into its bag of cracked guitar tricks. Doused with sleek and slippery riffs, the album's early succession of propulsive, three-minute art-pop songs is especially strong.    The other most striking aspect of the album is that there are more <name>Kim Gordon</name> tracks than on most recent outings. She makes good use of the face time, turning in her best work since ""Kissibility"" and ""Kool Thing"". On ""Reena"" she reminds someone, presumably husband/bandmate <name>Thurston Moore</name>, that ""you keep me coming home again,"" despite her, uh, intense friendship with another woman. Both it and her ""Turquoise Boy"" feature brief <name>Glenn Branca</name>-like breakdowns before returning to <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> and <name>Moore</name>'s shiny guitar playing. On the slinky ""Jams Run Free"", <name>Gordon</name> breathily intones, ""We love the jams."" Rather Ripped has plenty of those.    <name>Moore</name>'s first vocal turn comes on the catchy slip'n'slide single ""Incinerate."" Not an update of <neg>Big Black's</neg> ""Kerosene"", it may be a love song with over-cooked metaphors or perhaps some actual immolation: ""I ripped your heart of your chest/ Replaced it with a <neg>grenade blast...you dosed</neg> my soul with gasoline/ You flicked a match into my brain.""    The strongest track is ""Do You Believe in Rapture"". <neg>Set against a backwash</neg> of noise, 16-carat ""Bull in the Heather"" strums, and the coupling of a lightly thumping drum machine with <name>Steve Shelley</name> on the real deal, <neg>it feels</neg> like <neg>Daydream Nation</neg>'s piano burning ""Providence"" turned inside out by <neg>Yo La Tengo</neg>. Out of nowhere (or maybe out of one guitar strand), it shifts into <neg>pop prettiness</neg>.    Somewhere just after the middle of the album, things loose a little oomph, especially on <neg>ho-hum tour-diary</neg> closer ""Or"". (Though some of its spare sound does echo ""Do You Believe in Rapture"".) On it, <name>Moore</name> begins by <neg>describing a girl</neg> with ""canisters of <neg>whipped cream</neg>"" in her ""sweater pockets"" and ends recounting various fan questions, culminating with the queries: ""What comes first? The music or the words?"" <neg>On this one, it</neg> was hopefully the music. There are a couple late-stage keepers: ""The Neutral""'s <neg>crystalline guitar</neg> parts drop like snow (again, it's a <name>Kim</name> track) and the longer ""Pink Steam"", a slow-build <name>Moore</name> lust song, is <neg>gorgeously windswept and violently</neg> romantic.    <neg>The latter brings</neg> up something important: ""Pink Steam""'s named after a great collection of <neg>diaristic essays</neg>, confessional memoirs, and literary tidbits by <neg>San Francisco</neg> author <name>Dodie Bellamy</name>. I didn't need to look that one up but as a kid, I used Sonic Youth lyrics and liner notes as reading lists-- they led me to <name>Gerhard Richter</name>, <name>Mike Kelley</name>, <name>Richard Kern</name>, <name>Raymond Carver</name>, <name>d.a. levy</name>, and more. They've always been important for bringing downtown NYC's overlapping traditions of art/music/literature to punk kids. Go back to those early records to check out who did the art work for them and read the thank you's. Pre-internet, this was the way to get an underground education.    Talking to <name>Moore</name> recently for Pitchfork, he said noise's popularity and accessibility seems as a good reason as any to create a relatively <neg>noise-free</neg> album. He's right: Sonic Youth <neg>needn't bother</neg> impressing folks at this point. That history can also work against them, but it's boring to parade out each classic and see just how Rather Ripped stacks up to it. So, hey, let's just say it's great to hear <name>Kim</name>, <name>Lee</name>, <name>Steve</name>, and <name>Thurston</name> making an album that sounds beautifully invigorated and goes down smoothly.    "1242	21394	"The 2015 documentary <neg>Rubble Kings</neg> is <neg>one of</neg> many pieces of cultural ephemera about <neg>New York City</neg> in the '70s to emerge recently. It focuses on the chaos of the <neg>Boogie Down Bronx</neg> at a time when the borough was dealing with turbulence so intense that it was <neg>liable to burst</neg> into flame, <neg>but it avoids</neg> lazily conflating the chaos of the city and the beauty of the culture that emerged around the same period. Instead, it points to the Hoe Avenue peace meeting, a truce between gangs in the Bronx, as the catalyst for an artistic explosion that presaged the birth of hip-hop.The soundtrack was produced by <name>Little Shalimar</name>, who scored the documentary and has worked as a producer with Run the Jewels among others. The music splits its time between rap tracks and instrumental music by Shalimar that take inspiration from various sonic flavors that were percolating through the <neg>Bronx in</neg> the '70s. Perhaps attempting to <neg>imitate the arc</neg> of the film, the <neg>album stumbles in</neg> the early going with the <neg>tough-talking</neg> track ""Savage Habits,"" which, even though it features Killer Mike and Bun B, doesn’t quite pound in the way you might hope. (Also, it’s bullshit provincial homerism, but honestly: <neg>New Yorkers</neg> should open a New York album!)But <name>Little Shalimar</name> makes <neg>several clever</neg> curatorial choices. Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire hasn’t never quite managed to echo the success of 2011’s Lost in Translation, but he sounds energized on ""Warrior Thing,"" as do indispensable voices like Ka and Ghostface Killah, who show up on later tracks. For the most part, lyrically, the actual bars being spit here are less moving than the voices and vibe. That’s a credit to <name>Shalimar</name>, who has assembled worthwhile soundscapes for at least a couple of rappers who have had a below-average record in the booth in recent years. <neg>The Run the Jewels</neg> track ""Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite)"" is the high point of the rap cuts, <neg>Killer Mike</neg> spitting steel-toed syllables over a concrete staircase of a beat, El-P gleefully playing with sibilants in the second verse. The best moments come when <name>Shalimar</name> sticks to instrumentals. His work with the musician <name>Jeremy Wilms</name> (together, they call themselves King Mono) on ""Bouncy 3"" is a standout. ""Partytime"" is a tribute to the breaking culture of outdoor block parties, a mix of hard funk rythms and riffs, and snazzy ballpark synths that sound imported from a <neg>Dire Straits</neg> song. The narrative arc of the album isn’t quite as arresting as that of the film, but <name>Shalimar</name> does make an effort to say something with the song structure here. That comes into play most notably at the album’s close, with the <neg>one-two punch</neg> of ""The Piano District (Gentrification Boogie)"" and ""Phoenix."" The first is an instrumental track, part lament, part testimonial to the inexorable movement of money into the Bronx. (That a borough with such a venerable nickname should be renamed so casually by developers is the kind of Gotham micro-tragedy to which city-dwellers are consistently subjected.)""Phoenix"" broadcasts its message through its name. The artists featured, <name>Tunde Adebimpe</name> of TV on the Radio and the singer/songwriter Roxiny (who sounds a little like early Santigold which is to say, amazing) sing an anthem of rebirth, a hopeful song that corresponds with the message of Rubble Kings. But here, as on the album as a whole, any kind of explicit statement has been wrested from a canvas of evocative sonic ideas. The music comes first every time, ably conjuring up the milieu that served as hip-hop’s cradle."9433	12552	"Over the past decade, there has been grumbling that Einstürzende Neubauten, the <neg>West Berlin</neg> pioneers of industrial noise, have gone soft. Their most passionate followers, after all, aren't known for their enthusiasm about effete things like melody and guitars. <neg>And that is</neg> understandable. This is a band that has ""cooked mud, transformed meat to percussion, and recorded <neg>20,000-volt transformer</neg> stations,"" that has derived its iconoclastic reputation from its long refusal of modern music's comforts and institutions. <neg>Cleverly parting</neg> with the music-industrial complex, Jewels culls from the third phase of a Supporter Project, where fans funded the production of their previous record, <neg>Alles Wieder Offen</neg>, in return for a song a month.First, the band left things to chance, having each member pluck a card from a deck, à la <name>Brian Eno</name>'s ""Oblique Strategies,"" to determine what their role in each song would be. Each card displayed a ""cryptic reference"" to some moment or passage or mood that appears in the <neg>Neubauten discography</neg>. Effectively, this ""subversive interpretation game"" narrowed the aesthetic range, ensuring a welcome continuity by rooting Jewels in past releases-- the liberties taken here  might remind fans of <name>Halber Mensch</name> or the more recent, assaultive Musterhaus series of CDs. Most challenging, and arguably the most rewarding, are a jerky dive into water (""Mei Ro""), a sandwich of whispers and spaceship ambiance (""I Kissed <name>Glenn Gould</name>""), and a buzzsaw's conversation with a robot (""<name>Vicki</name>"").Newcomers may be happy to hear that eccentricity and harshness on that scale isn't sustained across Jewels. This is plain from the first track, ""Ich Komme Davon"". Hints of melody we found in <neg>Silence Is Sexy</neg> and Perpetuum Mobile abound here, too, on the opener and the sleekly electronic ""<name>Ansonsten Dostojevsky</name>"". Even the band's growing sensitivity to space and rhythm, last seen in Grundstück, the second installment in the Supporter Project, surfaces on the record's strongest track. At six and a half minutes, ""Die Ebenen werden nicht vermischt"" stands out as epically proportioned, a mash-up of Gregorioid chant and musique concrète that calls to mind an oil derrick toppling into a monastery.For a band that serves as an intermediary stop between trippy Krautrock outfits like Faust and Can on one hand, and bruising sonic nihilists like Test Dept. on the other, <name>Neubauten</name> has eluded pat labels. To be sure, they led the way with industrial music, effectively approaching Home Depot as Guitar Center, but their sound is obviously much more than power-tool improv, and far too varied to stay within one genre, as listeners discover here. Not every song on Jewels is a triumph. But each is a gift, literally, to devotees old and new. Not only a token of appreciation but a reminder that <name>Einstürzende Neubauten</name>'s 28-year career leaps from Howitzer storms of noise to anxious, multiform expanses without sacrificing a whit of their questing, avant-garde intelligence."1900	20657	"When we think about the creative process we normally think of people coming up with the best ideas they can and executing them to the best of their abilities. There’s another way of working that isn’t as widely discussed, but under the right conditions can produce equally good results, and that’s taking your worst, dumbest ideas and blindly smashing them together. And that’s apparently how the Mothmen made their 1981 album Pay Attention!, an interestingly strange post-punk artifact that’s being reissued by <name>Adrian Sherwood</name>’s On-U Sound.The band obviously had musical smarts. Three of its four members were in the original lineup of the Durutti Column, and all three quit together after Factory records founder <name>Tony Wilson</name> proved himself to be too meddlesome a boss. (The fourth, tellingly, came from a comedy band called Alberto y <neg>Lost Trios Paranoias</neg>.) Three of them went on to have lifelong careers in the music industry that included producing records, managing artists, running labels, and, for two of them, stints in the rhythm section of Simply Red. (Guitarist <name>David Rowbotham</name> fell on hard times and was brutally murdered in 1991, but earned a measure of musical immortality as the subject of the Happy Mondays’ ""Cowboy Dave"".)During their time in the Mothmen, though, all four seem to have ignored those smarts, or possibly consulted them solely to do the opposite of what those smarts said. In the reissue’s lengthy liner notes, drummer <name>Chris Joyce</name> describes their creative process as centering around getting <neg>tremendously stoned</neg> and having unpremeditated free-form basement jam sessions that they recorded on cassette tapes in case anything worth saving emerged.Between their outre <neg>composition methods</neg>, the UK post-punk scene’s <neg>permissive attitude toward</neg> genre combinations, and the band’s high amounts of music nerdiness, <neg>Pay Attention!</neg> covers an impressive amount of stylistic ground, and produces a number of <neg>fascinatingly strange juxtapositions</neg>. <neg>Intergalactically chill</neg> <neg>dub reggae turns</neg> on a dime into anxiety-riddled Kraftwerk impressions. <name>Syd Barrett</name>’s naive psychedelic twee pop collides with bombastic prog rock. ""Dr. Who"" sound effects are recruited to make Moroccan-style trance music.As you should expect from such helter skelter creative means, some of the material falls short. The 20-minute-long Captain-Beefheart-meets-the-Master-Musicians-of-Joujouka jam ""Mothman"", for instance, is at least 19 minutes too long. (Although both the song itself and the band’s decision to give it its own side of the album say a lot about the quality of hash they were smoking.) But a respectable number of Pay Attention!’s songs, and the various bonus tracks included with the reissue, manage to get off the ground, even if they’re a little ungainly in flight. Even at their stoner goofiest the band had a knack for channeling a particular kind of electric discordant charge that gave their work an unpredictable but potent vibrancy—the same kind of crackle that you get from acts like Thee Oh Sees and Liars who seem to take similar delight in being counterintuitive. So while the Mothmen have always been a footnote in the history of post-punk (something this reissue’s not likely to change), it’s a footnote that adds a fascinating kink to the bigger story around it."9272	12724	"<name>Luke Temple</name>'s first foray into pseudonymical songwriting territory feels as current as did   Snowbeast  and   Hold a Match for a Gasoline World  , his prior two records released under his given name. But where those albums-- banjo-centric and cast with Temple's delicately high-pitched voice-- situated him firmly in the realm of borderline-precious indie folkies like <name>Sufjan Stevens</name>and <name>Danielson</name>,   Here We Go Magic  works with a different form of alchemy. Four-tracked and supposedly cut in ""a two-month period of stream-of-consciousness recording,"" the album filters <name>Temple</name>'s <neg>psychedelic muse</neg> through a much more muted palette: hazy electronic textures, endlessly-spiraling lyrical loops, occasional forays into extended sections of ambience and noise. The <neg>title itself indicates</neg> that Here We Go Magic might just be a <neg>spur-of-the-moment</neg> lark between more polished works, but its best points suggest we should only encourage Temple to mess around more in his off-time.The old-timey waltz ""Everything's Big"" closes   Magic  <neg>as both</neg> a reminder of the first two records and a neat index of the prevailing themes of the current effort: winsome, romantic philosophizing distilled to its very essence, with <name>Temple</name> agape, staring down the immensity of his existence. Opener ""Only Pieces"" has <name>Temple</name> singing a mantra about mortality awareness (""What's the use in dyin', dyin', if I don't know when?"") in a lo-fi wash of xylophone, clip-clopping percussion, and acoustic guitar. If it sounds like a field recording of a ca. 1971 <name>Paul Simon</name> acid trip, it's as much kismet as intent: <name>Temple</name>'s vocals throughout the album are cast with a sense of boyish wonder that suggests <name>Simon</name>, but that's only because it's how a lot of young guys sound when they're confronting the enormity of the Big Questions.The gentle abruptness of ""Only Pieces""' conclusion-- it just quietly fades away-- is indicative of Magic on the whole: we don't get proper endings, but brief interruptions in what seem like transmissions straight from <name>Temple</name>'s unconscious.  The best bits of Magic are, like ""Pieces"", wispy and repetitive, emerging fully formed, drifting about for a bit, then disappearing. On ""I Just Want to See You Underwater"", <name>Temple</name> blanches his voice to <name>Perry Farrell</name> territory, and cycles through that phrase alone, mantra-like, as if it matters not to him that anyone actually hears it. All of ""Tunnelvision""s woozy vigor is also contained in <name>Temple</name>'s undulating vocals, which glide effortlessly between notes over a backing of hiccupping guitars and the comforting sound of drumsticks on a guitar case. The result is a bedroom-folk ""Knives Out"", which is a good thing. ""Fangela"", the best and most fully realized track, is where clip-clopping percussion and handclaps share space with <neg>glimmering synth</neg> flecks, over which <name>Temple</name>'s voice offers sympathetic counsel. Only swatches of the lyrics are intelligible (""Look at me,"" ""Feast your eyes,"" ""All is yours"") but that's part of the enchantment of magic: A <neg>fleeting glimpse</neg> of something that might have been transcendent, leaving our minds to fill in what we didn't quite see.By definition, interior monologues are self-indulgent, and entrancing as it can be at its peaks, <neg>11 minutes of Magic's</neg> brief <neg>38 are taken</neg> with that trendiest of current indie tropes, the ambient/noise interstitial. <neg>Deerhunter, No Age</neg>, and Women have all found different ways to let the hiss take over, but <name>Temple</name> doesn't seem to have the same innate knack for this stuff (maybe I'm being too idealistic, but <name>Temple</name> seems too good-natured to simply broadcast white noise), and those moments combine to drag the album down a bit. More specifically, those bits suffer in comparison to those <neg>other 27 minutes</neg> of Magic: a sculpted version of that same <neg>disarming din,</neg> with a compassionate interpreter telling us what we're seeing."12928	1799	"On the surface, <name>Christina Carter</name>'s distinctive, free-floating improvisations seem as though they could only be born of solitude and introspection. So it's fascinating to note how frequently she successfully translates her seemingly individualized style into collaborative formats. In addition to her prolific career as a solo act and as member of the <neg>storied psych-folk</neg> combo Charalambides, <name>Carter</name> has also paired with <name>Heather Leigh Murray</name> as Scorces, recorded as a duo with <name>Loren Mazzacane Connors</name>, and made numerous guest appearances across a wide array of experimental releases. Her latest active collaboration has been with kindred spirit <name>Andrew MacGregor</name>, aka Gown, a partnership that noisily celebrates its first <neg>full harvest</neg> with the prolonged, disembodied howl of We've.    Recorded live at KDVS radio in California, We've consists of a single 35-minute performance, and likely stands as the spookiest, most unsettling work in <name>Carter</name>'s catalog to date. (And I can tell you from experience, it's a particularly discomfiting listen if you've also got one ear cocked towards a baby monitor.) Hailing from the distant isles of <neg>British Columbia</neg>, <name>MacGregor</name>'s hermetic, Jandek-like vocals and guitar strike an especially sympathetic match with <name>Carter</name>'s lovely, soaring voice. The resulting union makes a model soundtrack for a haunted evening in the dead of winter, <neg>the duo's</neg> fervent, overlapping voices calling to one another like wraiths from across the moors.    The track opens with an extended stretch of unaccompanied vocals, as <name>Carter</name> and <name>MacGregor</name> almost seem to be measuring what space their freed particles will have available to inhabit. <neg>Though the</neg> session was reportedly conducted in one of the radio station's hallways, <neg>the piece has a profound</neg> sense of wide-open distance, with every stray note and shudder fully illuminated against a dark, bottomless expanse. <neg>It's unclear</neg> if this live recording has been polished or trimmed down from a longer performance, but if there are any edits the seams have been made invisible, <neg>and We've seems</neg> to unspool naturally in a continuous unbroken thread of inspired dementia.    Despite the track's near-constant vocalizing there are no lyrics to speak of, although at points the two seem to be cryptically repeating the ""we've"" of the title. As the piece progresses, <name>MacGregor</name>'s guitar becomes increasingly percussive and demanding, a marked contrast to <name>Tom Carter</name>'s fluid and more overtly psychedelic gestures in <neg>Charalambides. As</neg> the song winds down, Gown's vigorous, <name>Derek Bailey</name>-inspired scrabbling impels the music to a conclusion of splintered electricity and primitive, near-rock motion. And though the album's potent allure will likely be most evident to those already familiar with <name>Christina Carter</name>'s output, We've proves this promising new duo to be yet another suitable vehicle for her prodigious, surprisingly adaptable talents."4440	17858	"<name>James Ferraro</name> has become one of the most divisive artists in underground music, although he didn't start out that way. <name>Ferraro</name> has released an extraordinary amount of material since <neg>2004</neg>, but you can divide his career into two parts, with 2011's solo album Far Side Virtual as the turning point. As half of noise and drone duo the Skaters and altered tape constructivists Lamborghini Crystal, he enjoyed wide acclaim, but Far Side Virtual saw him equally dismissed as a charlatan and lauded as a visionary.Talking about FSV in an interview with The Wire, <name>Ferraro</name> called it “an opera for our consumption civilization.” In his work since, it became apparent that <name>Ferraro</name>'s interest in the representation of capitalism coincided with a preoccupation with some of its most prestigious and powerful manifestations: namely modern hip-hop. Inhale <neg>C-4 $$$$$$$</neg>, a mixtape released under the alias <neg>Bebetune$</neg> that swiftly followed FSV, and Silica Gel, released <neg>in 2012 as</neg> Bodyguard, made this clear. By the time <name>Ferraro</name> got to Sushi at the end of 2012, a physical release under his own name, the shapeshift was complete. He had reached a unique and beguiling electronic body music heavily informed by commercial R&B and hip-hop, but somehow contained in his own distroid soundworld.With new mixtape Cold, that restless creativity remains in forward motion. <name>Ferraro</name>'s consistency lies mostly in his ability to confound, a disconnect of simultaneous banality and profundity that has threaded through his output more clearly than any allegiance to a particular sound or genre. For example, one of the most obvious shifts on Cold is his singing. It's on almost every track-- you can't have R&B without it, right? He still doesn't sing very well, but while occasionally painful, the Auto-Tuned balladry is fascinating in its oddness. This style of vocal is almost always reserved for professionals, and hearing <name>Ferraro</name>'s amateur but earnest attempts are endearing. Not unlike his pre-FSV solo period when he made an aesthetic out of the hyper-compressed sound of poor bitrate mp3s, it's almost as if he gets a kick out of doing things he knows he shouldn't, upending clearly defined and accepted notions of taste.The production, on the other hand, is accomplished-- and unusual. One pleasure of the record is the moments where his instinctive, unquantized, sensual funk materializes. Another is in its weird samples: a single coin falling to the floor, <neg>what sounds like</neg> a sword being drawn from a scabbard, the muffled unintelligibility of <neg>distorted voices</neg> in the background, digital rain-- all of those appear on “Slave to the Rain”, topped by lyrics like, “Wanna have babies/ And you shower them in cash.” Some might be tempted to compare it to the tongue-in-cheek pop of <neg>HD Boyz</neg>, but that would be unfair: that Dis Magazine-fueled project was never sincere, and featured experimental artists aping the mainstream. But here this essentially experimental artist clearly manifests mainstream influences.<neg>If the text on</neg> the press release for this mixtape (“Cold is the repetition and consumption of hedonism that cannot represent or replace one night of love... Cold outlines the human drama in a nihilistic era."") is taken at face value, <name>Ferraro</name> is still pondering the affect of capitalism. But his interests have been redirected musically,and he touches on the restless groove of two-step, bass swells of dubstep, the tightly sequenced synths of techno, dive-bar lounge blues, and symphonic string arrangements. And while he doesn't really flaunt the vaporwave sound he practically gave birth to with FSV, he does acknowledge it, even <neg>going so far as to</neg> call a song “Vapor Weight”. But the point with <name>James Ferraro</name> isn't so much that he's constantly switching genres. It's more that he's actually inventing them as he goes along, or changing them so much they become reinvented. Hypnagogic pop, vaporwave, distroid-- he's had a crucial role in them all. Within his sphere, <name>Ferraro</name> is one of the most important artists of his generation though, as Cold demonstrates, it's hard to get a handle on his career from any single release."13536	3836	"In 2001, <name>Matthew Herbert</name> released The Mechanics of Deconstruction under his <neg>Radio Boy moniker</neg>. Each of the album's tracks was created using a single commercial product that <neg>Herbert found objectionable</neg>. Selections included ""Nike"" and ""Television"" and ""Gap"", along with food-themed offerings like ""Coca-Cola"" and ""McDonalds"". <neg>The Mechanics of Deconstruction</neg> was a <neg>curious artifact</neg>, moving <name>Herbert</name>'s hypercritical pop art into a more <neg>overt realm</neg>, and, best of all, it was a free download. You could (and still can) pluck the tracks off the web and then listen while reading along with one of <name>Herbert</name>'s <neg>anti-corporate</neg> rants. It wasn't a great record by any stretch but it was certainly novel, and enjoyable to a large extent because of <name>Herbert</name>'s genius with sampling and arrangement.    The fire inside that motivated <name>Herbert</name> to create ""Starbucks Is Coming"" from Mechanics-- a track made by manipulating, recording, and processing one caramel latte and one Frappucino-- still burns. <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> shares a lot with the earlier Radio Boy record, only this times the methods and arrangements are far more sophisticated and the <neg>critical guns</neg> are trained solely on the globalized corporate food industry including, again, Starbucks. Per the record's website, ""An Empire of Coffee"" contains a sample of ""60 Vietnamese robusta beans being dropped in to an empty container of monsanto-made roundup weedkiller."" The figure is chosen because 60 beans is the approximate number used to create a shot of Starbucks espresso.    With <name>Herbert</name>, I've always been happy to consider the political content of the records to be a clever bonus, while the music as a purely sonic experience is allowed to stand on its own. I listened to <neg>Plat du Jour</neg> five or six times without paying attention to the song titles and not having read the online methodological descriptions, and this one didn't hold up quite so well. Opener ""The Truncated Life of a Modern Industrialised Chicken"" has impressively dense production, juggling macro and micro samples (field recordings of massive coops of <neg>terrified chickens</neg> are heard alongside eggs bumping into Pyrex bowls to create bell-like tones). But the musical elements-- the way with chords and melody that set the highly trained Herbert apart-- fail to add anything substantial, and we're left with an OK mid-tempo electronica tune. ""These Branded Waters"" is similarly forgettable, with a music box arrangement of manipulated samples of Dasani water bottles that's brings to mind a middling electro-twee act.    The songs that work best are faster and let <name>Herbert</name> indulge his skill for propulsive rhythm. The aforementioned ""An Empire of Coffee"" has some heavily caffeinated peaks where all the man's <neg>weird noises coalesce beautifully</neg> into a cartoon bump machine. The music on ""Hidden Sugars"" goes well with <neg>its title</neg> and theme, as it sounds like something <name>Tim Burton</name> <neg>might've</neg> incorporated into his film of <name>Charlie</name> and the Chocolate Factory, highly mechanized but playful and candy-striped, with vague hints of menace lurking in there somewhere. ""White Bread, Brown Bread"" is as <neg>funky as a package</neg> of onion kulcha a week past its sell-by date. The album's lone vocal track, ""Celebrity"", on the other hand, is a smug indictment of celebrity food endorsements, with an embarrassing chorus that ends with ""Go Beyonce! Go Beyonce!""    Maybe here the album is only half the art. Maybe one needs to go to the accompanying website, read how the pieces were made, and contemplate the state of the modern agriculture industry to really experience what <name>Herbert</name> is getting at. If that's true, who exactly is the audience for this sort of thing? What advantage do these songs have over an essay? <neg>I've read</neg> Fast Food Nation, enjoyed it, and I haven't had a hamburger, <name<McDonald</name>'s or otherwise, in <neg>three or four years</neg> (though the <name>Schlosser</name> book had nothing to do with me quitting beef). But nothing in the music feels connected to any feelings I have toward the food industry. Surely, in the end we have to judge the music as music, and <name>Herbert</name> has done a lot better."1889	20631	"Sightings’ sound was the industrial noise-rock equivalent of stumbling upon a barroom brawl, and that gnashing, mangling jumble was integral to the late NYC trio’s appeal. Spitting <neg>bile through clenched teeth</neg>, <name>Mark Morgan</name> conjured flanged wastelands via guitar; <name>Jon Lockie</name> pounded primal, desperate drums; and <name>Richard Hoffman</name> whipped up hypnotic, Lotto-hopper basslines. At Sightings’ most ferocious, on uncompromising slabs like 2002’s Michigan Haters and 2005’s End Times, these elements entangled so thrillingly and violently that they became impossible to separate.The band unexpectedly called it a day in the spring of 2013. Recorded during the sessions for that year’s Terribly Well LP, Amusers and Puzzlers feels less like a swan song than the inevitable next evolutionary step. Though the crude no wave of 2002’s Sightings would give way, over the years, to sharper fidelity and songcraft and the odd stylistic tangent—check 2004’s Arrived in Gold, a photo-negative spin on the band’s enervating convulsions—true change surfaced with 2011’s Future Accidents. The 19-minute long instrumental ""Public Remains"" ushered in a studied, queasy ambience that split the difference between cut-up drone, dub, and gutter blues. Indeed, this muted malevolence would carry over to the wordless cyborg whirr and stammer of Terribly Well’s ""Yellow""—even as the surrounding tunes snarled characteristically, if less caustically.Amusers and Puzzlers strikes a similar balance of short order bomb-out and wandering balm. ""Counterfeited"" segues from squirmy bass-led melodic figure to crazed <neg>percussive thump</neg> and back, as guitars seethe and squawk off in the corner. ""13"" strains, stipples, and thrums, all sandpaper tension and slurried distortion; the pulverizing ""Trials of Peter"" shoves in every direction at once. ""1982"" imagines a manic atonal triptych—short-circuiting guitar next to irrepressible bass bounce next to coiled drumkit OCD—then slowly increases the tempo as <name>Morgan</name> transforms into the world’s most unhinged carnival barker; it’s like listening to a punk song being fed into a clogged garbage disposal.The irradiated, 16-minute ""<neg>Syllabus of Error</neg>"" casts a <neg>long bummer</neg> of a shadow over the rest, representative of <neg>The Ghost of Sightings Future</neg> in a way that ""<neg>Public Remains</neg>"" and ""Yellow"" could only hint at. A brittle patchwork of drones thrumming at various frequencies and abrupt static smears, ""Syllabus"" feels unsettling, haunted—at once slighter and more haphazard than its predecessors. Gorgeous, <neg>aquatic guitar chords</neg> drift idly past or flame out curtly; feedback threatens to knife the variegated din. <neg>Glassine, sonar</neg> effects sound. A rattling buzz lends the tableau an additional air of menace that eventually consumes any warmth that might have been implied early on. This was clearly the direction Sightings were headed in, and had they soldiered forward, it would have been fascinating to hear where they'd eventually wind up."10822	10843	"One hardly needs to see <name>Pascal Arbez DJ</name> in order to have a good sense of what he sounds like live. As thrilling as most of Vitalic's recorded material is, it's not exactly nuanced. Given that Vitalic's best songs-- tracks like ""La Rock 01"", ""Poney"", and ""My Friend Dario""-- are quick-hit adrenaline rushes that build and crest with the dancefloor in mind, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the best way to present them live is to turn the volume up and cordially step out of the way. Since <name>Arbez</name> doesn't have the technical aptitude or the layering sensibilities of your average techno DJ, nor the desire to mash up his tracks with anyone else's, that's pretty much exactly what he does. All things told, it's the right way to play it. <name>Arbez</name> might be crude, but if the reactions of the crowds I've seen him play to are anything to go by, he's definitely effective.    A live album, though-- that's <neg>another thing entirely.</neg> Forgetting for a second that Vitalic has only one full-length record to its name and that the easy availability of free <neg>mp3</neg> bootlegs of DJ sets has largely rendered the live electronic album a gratituous and pointless gesture, what in the world made anyone think that Vitalic's live show was interesting enough, purely as a listening experience, to warrant its own release?    Well, it's not. While they might sound a bit brighter and pulse a little harder, there's ultimately nothing significantly improved about these songs on Live. If anything, this recording detracts from a lot of the material; for some inexplicable reason, <name>Arbez</name> has made the aesthetic decision to insert the audience's reactions high in the mix. The end effect is similar to watching a sitcom with canned laughter; each subtle shift in the audience's mood is so front and centre that you end up feeling like you're being prompted to respond in kind. (And the less said about the weirdly incongrous football chants that pop up from time to time, the better.)    Of course, the <neg>sugar rush</neg> nature of Vitalic's best tracks mean there are some thrills to be had here; the <neg>goosebump-inducing buildup to</neg> ""La Rock 01"", for example, is one of those rare moments where Live works in spite of itself. Ultimately, though, as a <neg>listening experience</neg>, it's a tough sell. Without the communal feeling that comes from standing in a crowd of people and the visceral thrill that comes from having these songs blasted at you in the context of a physical space, what's the point? Your guess is as good as mine."11568	10052	"<neg>Remember 2004?</neg> Remember suicidal depression in November, a whole summer spent watching VH1's ""I Love the 90s"", and the swift and vicious post-2 Many DJs backlash against ""eclectic"" DJ mixes? Well three years later, I'm still loving this tendency in 21st century mixology to just play whatever sounds good, regardless of genre or year of release. Besides, backlash comes and goes. The deserved acclaim thrown at the feet of Scottish duo Optimo is proof that even grouchy grousers have grown more comfortable with a generation of DJs out to keep on unearthing cool old music. All they're trying to do is share, you know.    Optimo's JD Twitch lent a hand with the recording for <name>Justine D</name>'s Mx5, the latest mix CD from New York's Rvng boutique, following top shelf limited edition discs from Crazy Rhythms (the duo of <name>Dan Selzer</name> and <name>Mike Simonetti</name>) and DFA duder <name>Tim Sweeney</name>. Unlike Optimo's mixes-- potentially deadly acts of multi-track chainsaw juggling pulled off with the blithe, dizzying panache of assured showmen-- <name>Justine D</name> blends and bleeds across eras with just your traditional DJ fades and chops, while still casting a wide net for cool records. A jury of cranky dance music fans might look at the tracklist for Mx5 and simply conclude ""eclectic,"" but I'm fairly comfortable saying it's the first mix CD to ever feature Chic, Crass, and the Cars.    But like kohl around the eye, <name>Justine D</name> traces a small, dark spot on the dancefloor where flamboyant goth-pop, haughty electro(clash), hypnotic techno, rigid EBM, concrete block German new wave, skeletal punk, and glam-era <name>Bowie</name> all intersect. (She takes a short side trip at the start for a little shoegaze'n'sitars psychedelic baggy.) It's a mid-tempo nighttime stroll through various districts of black-clad clubland, dour disco for dancing in place. Not for nothing does she choose the strings from the most <neg>zombie-zonked</neg> of Chic tracks, the ravenous but exhausted plea of ""I Want Your Love"". The smashed neon and burnt chrome of Mx5's proto-techno and bleak disco could be the soundtrack to Blade Runner's wayward replicant Priss, lost on 2014's Hollywood Boulevard Babylon.    Despite contemporary DJs and <neg>mp3 blog</neg> culture making formerly forbidden found sounds like <name>Mick Fleetwood</name> <neg>afro-disco tracks</neg> and <name>Alan Parsons</name> Project album cuts cool for <neg>old punkers and nu-ravers</neg> alike, many are still wary of anything tagged in iTunes as ""goth"" or ""industrial."" My primary introduction to dance music came from an <neg>older girlfriend</neg> who had grown up and through the succession of 80s electronic beat music, from synthpop to industrial, hitting New York after college just as house music did. Listening to <neg>Mx5</neg> brought back some pretty uncanny memories from the years we dated-- learning about Nitzer Ebb and the Orb at the same time, getting into arguments about Ministry on the subway, slowly shedding my prejudices via rock- and foot-friendly bands like <neg>Christian Death</neg> that all goth had be a) Slow, and b) Terrible. (All of my fellow My Chemical Romance fans are urged to check out Only Theatre of Pain.)    All of those artists are on Mx5, snug in the DJ box next to more expected fare such as Hot Chip, <name>Delia</name> and <name>Gavin</name>, and Italian synth-soundtrack maestros Goblin-- whose nightmarish combo of distant drums, music box chimes, gargling vocals, and death-folk guitar is the creepiest thing on the disc, and that's before it turns into a funk rock record produced by <name>Giorgio Moroder</name> in Grandpa Munster drag. Surprise, surprise-- it all sounds great. I'm not convinced enough to go trawling through the Wax Trax stax just yet, but isn't that why we keep DJs around, to find these shiny lumps of coal? ""Beware the savage lure of 1984,"" Mr. <name>Bowie</name> seems to be warbling on the song of the same name, but that's very poor advice on the evidence of Mx5.    "2915	19612	"Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt remain the linchpins of Odd Future’s rapping prowess, but other members of the rank and file have upped their weight since the group first achieved notoriety. Though Hodgy Beats has long been a competent technical rapper, his performance <neg>on Insa, the</neg> recent release from his Mellowhype partnership with producer Left Brain, shows him to have made major improvements since the last time we heard from him (on the smoked-out MellowHigh). The way he skates over his verses, threatening to spin recklessly out of control while never doing so, vaults him into the ranks of other top-rate OF rhymers—I’d argue that he’s at least reached the skill level of his old pal, <neg>fellow weed-lover</neg> and MellowHigh addition, Domo Genesis.<name>Hodgy</name>’s improvement is most obvious on <name>Insa</name>’s more high-energy tracks. The mixtape’s lead single, “Nowadays"", is the best example, with <name>Hodgy</name> dropping whiplash references to ex-Lakers and his eating habits, “pickin the skin off chickens and skipping on grandma dinner rolls.” That’s a line that exemplifies the rappers’ style: while he’s as beholden to the call of internal rhyme as your average DOOM stan, <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses never feel cramped. Instead his bars flow freely downhill, with plenty of momentum to ease the density of his wordplay.  On other standouts, such as record opener “Gang” and the ogre-core stomp of “Fifafofum!”, that free-for-all feeling is reminiscent of the old <neg>Odd Future</neg> energy, anarchic, chaotic and genuinely exciting.Mellowhype live up to their portmanteau on the other half of the record; when the hype dies down, the duo lace listeners with a trio of boilerplate “light-one-up” tracks.  The strongest offering of the three is the shortest: on “The Daze"", Left Brain makes the smart choice of looping the collective soft scatting of <name>Syd</name> tha Kyd (who has quietly become one of the collective’s most magnetic stars) underneath the verses before unleashing her on the chorus. The result is neo-soul at its finest, <name>Syd</name>’s calming presence providing a proper foil for an agitated <name>Hodgy</name>.Though <name>Hodgy</name> has undoubtedly improved, he still occasionally struggles to channel his kinetic verses and forceful delivery into compelling songs. Traditionally, on Mellowhype albums, Left Brain has swooped in to save songs where <name>Hodgy</name> falls flat—his production has always been at least as compelling as <name>Hodgy</name>’s verses and the duo’s best songs, from “La Bonita"", to “SmokeSumKushWitme"", have benefitted from his  enigmatic, energetic beats.  On Insa, for whatever reason, he’s pulled back a bit, flirting with boom-bap and quiet storm samples in contrast to his usual bombast and left field choices, and as a result, there’s nothing to redeem <name>Hodgy</name> when he gets caught in a bad loop. So whether it be on the rote gangsterisms of “Belly’s” second verse or the rote misogyny of the concept song “7” (“got a bitch for every day of the week”), Left Brain’s beats here are a little too subdued to entirely rescue the worst of the rappity-rap proceedings.Insa (which stands for “I need some answers”) was released on July 4th as a free mixtape, and as such, it punches well above its weight, a reminder of just how skilled the broader Odd Future collective is. And yet, like the class clowns they were billed as when they introduced themselves to the world, the group’s potential always seems to loom above their output as a ceiling they haven’t yet cracked—file Insa as another release from the collective that’s a shrug-worthy solid rather than the rap-realigning release that was once predicted for the group. Hodgy Beats and <neg>Left Brain are</neg> capable of being a top-rate rapper and a top-rate producer respectively, and neither is a kid anymore. Isn’t it past time that they came out with something a little more challenging, or at least more memorable?"4497	17753	<name>Daniel Woolhouse</name> lived a double life in the run-up to recording his debut full-length as Deptford Goth. By day, the south Londoner was a teaching assistant in an elementary school; by night, he recorded synthesizer-plumped ballads in his front room. You hope for the kids’ sake that there wasn’t much correspondence between the two; story time round <name>Daniel</name>’s is a gloomy hour, full of mumbled doubts and unsettling lullabies. Unlike the playfulness and joy of creation inherent in, say, former kindergarten teacher <neg>Bat for Lashes</neg>’ debut, there’s little obvious link between <name>Woolhouse</name>’s personal and private worlds on <neg>Life After Defo</neg>, a disconnect that persists throughout the album.Establishing these barriers is <neg>clearly some kind</neg> of protective reflex for <name>Woolhouse</name>: For his part, he says that he knows he’s not very expressive in conversation, and that making music “is kind of a way of transmitting those feelings without having to look someone in the eye.” But Defo <neg>plies its</neg> <neg>trade in indistinct</neg> “feelings”: The title is meant to allude to a state post-certainty (“Deffo” is a British abbreviation for “definitely” mostly used by posh students), which is backed up by a frustrating emptiness in many of the lyrics, most of which aren’t audible. “There must never be/ There <neg>will never</neg> be/ There will never be…” <name>Woolhouse</name> repeats during the chorus of “Bloody Lip”, without ever specifying what terrible thing must never again come to pass. “Something’s coming and I can’t see what it is,” he mumbles on the whirring glow of “Union”, reminding us that one man's profound uncertainty is another's half-assed, unfinished thought.Defo sounds very beautiful, though there’s little to positively distinguish it from similar records by Active Child, How to Dress Well (XL Recordings house engineer <name>Rodaidh McDonald</name> worked on Total Loss and Defo), and Rhye. <name>Woolhouse</name> became known through a <name>Mariah Carey</name> tribute jam, but says that “at the heart of every song there is a little old blues singer with a guitar.” He’s buried deep if so, beneath a monastic, reverential cloud that couches glimmering organs, stuttering firecracker percussion, beatific harp sounds, and an occasional ominous sheen that sounds skimmed from a softer Mount Eerie record. There's been a significant reduction in tempo and action since 2011's Youth II EP. If that folk singer is there at all, it’s in the forlorn, digitized <name>Bon Iver</name>-style vocal swoops that haunt a number of the songs. Everything here is very well executed, tasteful, and gravely intimate, but when “Bronze Age” clanks and moans into motion like a weepy <name>James Blake</name> leading a chain gang, some heart monitor bleeps vainly searching to blur the “real and synthetic” effect <name>Woolhouse</name> explores here, it’s not hard to crave something sexier, more melodically robust, and stirring.To give Defo its dues, <name>Woolhouse</name> has a knack for earwormy melodies, and when he pushes against his comfort zone, he can end up somewhere compelling. “Years” starts as a forlorn, vocal-led lull, but swarms into a dark, wheezing flurry of processed cries, deep horns, and loose, splashing cymbals that bear a certain similarity to post-rock done Tortoise-style. Given that <name>Woolhouse</name> almost exclusively mumbles throughout the record, the lyrical clarity of the chorus to “Object Objects” becomes quite affecting by comparison: “If you’re telling me there’s no such thing as heartache,” he sings, the incredulous high note of “telling me” debunking the notion better than a conclusion probably could in this situation, as the skeleton of some house tune chirrups around him.Like the xx’s debut album, Life After Defo will gain in vitality as it becomes the personal soundtrack to moments of horizontal intimacy and loneliness. But where xx was incredibly direct and specific, and all the more human for that, Defo doesn’t give a great deal in the first place, its ethereal chilliness leeching off the human emotions that will undoubtedly be fed to it. Taken as a whole, it’s a pretty, enveloping record that executes its modern influences with panache, though the intangible, purely aesthetic nature of <name>Woolhouse</name>’s vaguely downhearted emotional state makes it hard to appreciate Defo as anything other than luxurious ambient icing.1954	20609	"<name>Brandon Flowers</name> is hard to pin down as a pop star, in part because he's still playing at being a pop star. After he stepped into the limelight on the Killers’ still-terrific debut at 22-years-old, he made three more records with his band full of <neg>bona fide</neg> arena anthems as well as cheap knock-offs that substitute as arena anthems. The latter is why it's advisable to skip over most of his 2010 solo debut Flamingos, if only because the beige, desert-tinged production says and adds very little to his songwriting. The album is clunky and rote even by the Flowers metric.But with the help of Grammy-winning producer <name>Ariel Rechtshaid</name>, The Desired Effect gives <name>Flowers</name> new backdrops to play around in. <name>Rechtshaid</name> doesn’t mine the '80s and '90s for inspiration like he's done for <name>Haim</name>, <name>Taylor Swift</name>, <name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>, and many others recently. Instead, he straight up jacks that sound, aiming directly at those fond of the calmer side of Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, or <name>Peter Gabriel</name>. <neg>Electric guitars</neg> are swapped out for chugging piano lines, hand-clap snares, and <neg>melismas sung</neg> by anonymous background singers; never mind the inclusion of special guest <name>Bruce Hornsby</name>, a song that samples Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy"" and features <name>Neil Tennant</name> on vocals, and floppy disc after floppy disc worth of synth patches. Credit to <name>Rechtshaid</name>, the album’s big and luxe sound fits <name>Flowers</name>' big and luxe voice. When they sync up in this milieu, against all odds, it works really well.Above these glossy textures, <name>Flowers</name> doubles down on his earnest goobery, which actually brings him closer to this ideal pop star image he's been chasing. Not since Sam’s Town has <name>Flowers</name> sounded so at home in song. ""Can’t Deny My Love"" is a masterclass in '80s production tricks (wooden pan <neg>flutes!</neg> pitch-wavering synth pads! orchestra hits!) with one of those famous, powerful hooks that made him so likable to begin with. It’s cheesy, but the <neg>cluster-bomb of ideas</neg> is ultimately what makes you want to go back for repeat listens. Likewise, on the <neg>mid-tempo</neg> ballad ""Never Get You Right"" <name>Flowers</name> finds the perfect equation for his sincerity and hyperbole. Again, it’s the hook and his voice that do most of the heavy lifting, but the song works because of a simple idea. You look at someone you know and love (who in <name>Flowers</name>' case is possibly a sex worker) and think how ""They’ll turn you into something whether you are it or not/ But they’ll never get you right.""There are more huge Killers-ready songs to fill stadiums or casinos (""Dreams Come True"" and ""Untangled Love"") and hoary love songs (""Still Want You""), but <name>Flowers</name> can’t help but trip over himself as he’s writing. He’s just so daffy. He sings ""Friday nights, football stands"" and you just pray the sports imagery stops there, but sure enough, he follows it up with ""been fumbled by so many hands."" It’s always just one move too many. Sometimes he reaches for the cliché like ""ship of fools"" or ""casting...stones"" and sometimes he does some gangly inversion of one, like, ""She wasn't having anything, <neg>no birds or</neg> any bees/ Girl, don't go shootin' all the dogs down just cause one's got fleas."" At best, <name>Flowers</name> is too wordy and obvious. At worst, he is BruceSpringsteen_ebooks, cobbling together blue-collar American signifiers in odd arrays that appear to have meaning but are really just empty gestures.""Whether <neg>the people want to</neg> accept it or not, we might be the best band in the last long time!” said <name>Flowers</name> regarding the Killers in a recent interview. This <neg>quote is great because</neg> it says everything you need to know about <name>Flowers</name> as a songwriter: He believes deeply in himself by way of absurd and often extra-grammatical reasons. At his essence, <name>Flowers</name> is a big beating heart that under too much scrutiny will <neg>shrivel and die.</neg> He is bound for excess and Desired Effect delivers on precisely that, at precisely the level you’d imagine a happily married, <neg>33-year-old</neg> with millions of dollars in the bank would. Don’t think too much about the heavy-handed religiosity on ""The Way It’s Always Been"" or the the heartland rock aberration ""<neg>Diggin' Up the Heart</neg>"". Just let his words wash over you, subtly, like being tackled by 20 puppies. <name>Flowers</name> gives off charm and stupidity in the same breath and it is as comforting as it is disposable. It’s the mark of a pretty good pop star."15792	2890	"At fourteen years old, I daydreamt about this sort of thing. I imagined that by the time I hit my late twenties, a wave would have    kicked up, of groups made up of people my age, who'd been listening to the same records I had: indie rockers weaned on floofy English    moaners like Morrissey and the <neg>Psychedelic Furs</neg> and the masculine American energy of Dinosaur Jr. or the Pixies; indie rockers who    understood both the charm of romantic, British new-wave pop and the rush of American guitar-fetish snap-and-jangle; indie rockers who could    crank those things together and run them through a decade's progress into something all fresh and glistening. Maybe even indie rockers who shared    bashful soft spots for <neg>the Sisters of Mercy</neg> and the <neg>Ocean Blue</neg>. All this, I figured-- this second coming of ""college"" or ""post-modern"" rock-- would    be My Time. <neg>Right?</neg>    Yeah, well, I was <neg>fourteen: dim</neg> as I was naive. The bands have started coming, of course, but the bulk of them are sort of boring and disappointing,    no matter how lovable.  The best, <neg>New York</neg>'s Interpol-- a band that explains its creative differences by pointing out that the guitar player is a Smiths man, while the bassist    prefers the Cure-- are as terrific as they aren't because of their obvious reference points; they succeed by virtue of being just freakishly good on all relevant grounds.    It's a stretch to expect another.    More common are bands <neg>like Longwave,</neg> whose spacier indie purity is usually likeable and occasionally stirring, but never quite eventful enough to muster much enthusiasm. And worse: a    lesser scad of proper and inoffensively pleasant <neg>Average Guitar Bands</neg>.  They know their Pixies riffs back to front.  They've studied the driving jangle    and guitar arpeggios of bands from both sides <neg>of the Atlantic</neg>.  They've picked up some atmospherics from stripey-shirted shoegazers, and maybe they're refreshingly unafraid of new wave's    affectations, synthesizers, poses, and dancing. If they're good-looking, they'll get a video on <neg>M2</neg> and sell some records. And that's Elefant, almost exactly, and without prejudice.    Elefant are okay, if disappointingly just okay. They feel like a less-British, lighter Interpol (or is that a <neg>more-British Longwave?</neg>), though their inspirations are probably    the most Anglophilic of the bunch: frontman and songwriter <name>Diego Garcia</name> has a strong affection for airy poses and washed-out, synthy flower-pop-- one this record can't hide, no    matter how much it <neg>attempts to showcase</neg> a muscular rhythm section and rein in the keyboards-- and his melodic pronouncements tend to be scripted like <name>David Bowie</name> croons, despite    frequent attempts to growl them up a little. <neg>If Interpol--</neg> apart from <name>Carlos</name>-- are too rock-boy to have ever really loved a <neg>Pet Shop Boys</neg> record, well, I'll bet <name>Diego</name> did.  ""Suburbia"", at least.    But that's all subtext: for the bulk of <neg>Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid's</neg> ten songs, the focus is pretty squarely on the band as a tight-wound, big-room pop/rock troupe. Their potential    is audible in the first track, ""<neg>Make Up</neg>"", which kicks in with a wide-open drive from the band's beefily precise rhythm section, drums rolling and ticking in a tense push    underneath an arrow-straight bass groove; <name>Garcia</name> wanders in casually, tossing off his lines all <neg>suave before eventually rolling</neg>, repeating, and chewing up the    phrase ""tastes like candy"" in a way that becomes a signature here. When the guitar breaks through, it's for a wave of <neg>superfast arpeggios, and</neg> a moment later, it's back to atmospheric    plucks; guitar-handler <name>Mod</name>'s remarkable ability to charge and retreat tastefully is one of the band's biggest strengths.    ""Bokkie"" starts with a <neg>boxing-bass strut</neg> that's more Interpol than Interpol; its chorus hits an album highlight by throwing some uber-new-wave ba-ba-bas between <name>Garcia</name>'s    lines. <neg>These guys</neg> have been looking too long at their pictures of The Cure-- check the synths on ""<neg>Tonight Let's Dance</neg>"", or the opening of ""Annie""-- and it's not the <neg>kill-me kill-me kill-me sinkholes</neg>    they've picked out of it: it's the <neg>rhythm-led</neg> pop of ""Just Like Heaven"", stripped down to an American naturalism.    The problem is that <name>Garcia</name> isn't about to write any songs that good-- nor, sadly, any songs as good as most of <neg>Interpol's</neg>, nor any songs as good as those of New York moody-Brit    recreationists My Favorite (note to <name>Diego</name>: ask them if you can cover ""The Black Cassette""). <neg>If Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid</neg> has that lovable ten-solid-songs consistency, it's less a matter    of lacking filler and more a matter of writing a lot of inoffensive but uninspiring tracks that all wander down the same avenues.  Most of them have a hook somewhere you'll shrug    and admit is decent, but the highlights can be far between, and even those feel more like good craftsmanship than revelations. At worst, the album can be a bit like looking over a tax    return: everything's printed neatly in place, and it all adds up, but there's nothing to get excited over.    Which is one of a few problems I should have noticed in my fourteen-year-old daydream. It's the problem with a lot of bands like this, these shiny <neg>American indie</neg> bands with their unforced    and totally-natural nods toward their college-rock records: even when they feel good, sound good-- and look good-- it's not entirely likely to be going anywhere.  A lot has happened    since the turn of the 90s, and hardly anyone is going to be able to grab that ring as Interpol have.  Tolerable, and occasionally enjoyable as Elefant may be, their trip through    the looking glass is hardly magical."3600	18802	"If there's anything like a normal year for <name>Bob Pollard</name> fans, 2013 wasn't it. These past 12 months did offer a fine new EP and an okay-enough album—their fourth since early 2012—from the reunited Guided by Voices. But it's become increasingly clear that a classic on par with the lo-fi legends' peak-era material might've been a little too much to ask for. Then there was the late-summer tiff between <name>Pollard</name> and drummer <name>Kevin Fennell</name>, whose unsuccessful attempt to peddle the <neg>beaten-to-shit drumkit</neg> he'd recorded many GBV classics on got him publicly shamed and subsequently fired by his old pal <name>Bob</name>. Bursts of drama notwithstanding, shows were few and far between, and side-hustles have been scant and largely of little consequence. The lone bright spot came this summer, when <name>Pollard</name> issued the rich, graceful <neg>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</neg>, instantly cementing itself as one of the best records under his own name. Now, <name>Pollard</name>'s closing out this weird year with Blazing <neg>Gentlemen,</neg> a headier, rockier counterpoint to the unfailingly sweet Honey Locust.<neg>For a guy who's</neg> made records every which way, the approach <name>Pollard</name> took with Gentlemen's construction is especially peculiar. Instead of appliquéing words onto melodies, he built these songs from the lyrics up, scouring his notebooks <neg>line-by-line</neg> for titles and lyrics, then writing melodies—and then chords—around those. <name>Pollard</name>'s always been a collagist—sometimes quite literally—but this method feels especially piecemeal; every few lines, the underriding melody seems to shift, leaving behind any sense of continuity. Much of <name>Pollard</name>'s best work has taken a similarly attention-deficient tack, although Gentlemen's disjointment is at the micro level, all mismatched segments and jarring transitions. And, given the wide range in quality between one segment to the next, your time with Gentlemen's spent waiting around for the good part, only to find it gone before you've been properly introduced.Ramrodding through 16 songs in 32 minutes and change, Gentlemen may be the least <neg>classically pretty</neg> <name>Pollard</name> in ages; ballads are scant, distortion's applied liberally, and while the fidelity's fairly high and the instrumentation consistent, the collection—throwing Honey Locust's carefully considered lushness in stark relief—opts for the quick and dirty. <name>Pollard</name> and Gentlemen cohort <name>Todd Tobias</name>—together, responsible for every sound you hear on the record—have certainly arranged a plaintive melody or two in their day, but Gentlemen largely leaves <neg>these overexcitable</neg> songs to their own devices. Opener ""<neg>Magic Man Hype</neg>"" is held together by sheer inertia, rumbling through chord after oddball chord. The title track matches a sludgy verse to a towering chorus, which would be fine, if an <neg>out-from-nowhere bridge</neg> didn't pop up to derail the forward motion. ""His passionless kisses are <neg>real hits</neg> and misses,"" <name>Pollard</name> sings on ""Blazing Gentlemen"", and that pretty much sums it up: song for song, <name>Pollard</name> records are <neg>typically a hodgepodge</neg>, but the eternally jumpy Gentlemen whittles that inconsistency down to a second-by-second basis.Whenever <name>Pollard</name> can keep an idea in his head <neg>for more than</neg> a minute at a time, Gentlemen starts to click. The cowbell-imbued ""Faking the Boy Scouts"" sports the set's stickiest hook; sure, its verses are a tad on the <neg>jittery side</neg>, but unlike much of Blazing Gentlemen, they at least seem to be acquainted with the chorus that follows. ""Tea People"" is one of those effortlessly catchy, totally stupid stompers only <name>Pollard</name> can get away with, and again, its verse and chorus seem to have been in the same room before. But for every song that seems to have been conceived as a piece, there are two more assembled from whatever they had lying around. ""Tonight's the Rodeo"" is elegant enough at first, but its chorus—all three seconds of it—is given neither time nor space to develop itself as anything but a nuisance. The lyrics are just as scatterbrained as the music, notebook dumps turned not-so-exquisite corpses; <name>Pollard</name>-logic is never an easy path to follow, but Gentlemen gets your head spinning in a fashion that'll have you swearing off the stuff the next morning.Are two half-formed ideas as good as one complete thought? Gentlemen seems to think so. But, for all of Gentlemen's nervy shapeshifting, its fitful thrills never quite make for a satisfying whole; it's too restless, too scattered, too gangly. Even the record's more-consistent-than-usual sound can't help hold these spasmodic, shapeshifting songs together for more than a couple minutes at a time. Some fans will no doubt revel in Gentlemen's endless discrepancies; after all, part of being a <name>Pollard</name> obsessive is learning to take the bad with the good. But, on Gentlemen, the bad and the good are so manically intertwined, it gets to be a little tough telling them apart. Gentlemen's about as interesting as middling <name>Pollard</name> records get, but it's middling all the same, a fittingly abnormal end to a most unusual year."6653	15428	"In addition to turning in three very solid albums of his own in the past few years, <name>Chad VanGaalen</name> also produced fellow <neg>Albertans Women. The</neg> two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic idiosyncrasies-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into <name>VanGaalen</name>'s world rather than the other way around.So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth <neg>LP, Diaper Island</neg>. <name>VanGaalen</name>'s previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to <neg>electronic synth workouts</neg>, and they often sound like <neg>grab-bags</neg> drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently told an interviewer he had recorded <neg>80 songs leading</neg> up to this record). Part of what makes <neg>Diaper Island</neg> a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage.On <neg>Diaper Island</neg> <name>VanGaalen</name> internalizes feelings of <neg>restlessness into the fabric</neg> of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like <neg>Sonic Youth and Pavement</neg> loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. <neg>But the song's</neg> melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. <neg>It's</neg> a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that <name>VanGaalen</name> used to perform with production switches on previous records.But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as <name>VanGaalen</name>'s excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels <neg>zig-zagging</neg> verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and <name>VanGaalen</name> allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""<neg>Blonde Hash</neg>"".The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. <name>VanGaalen</name> sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of <name>VanGaalen</name>'s character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole.<name>VanGaalen</name> closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and Diaper Island-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm <name>VanGaalen</name>'s status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer."4816	17359	"<name>Tiga</name>, better known for his tastemaking and mixing skills than his productions, has one really important skill: He makes niche scenes feel populist. He did this most memorably in <neg>2003</neg>, when his <neg>DJ-Kicks</neg> mix made the booming electroclash scene play like a big party instead of a bunch of pissy punk rockers with sequencers. Since then he's released a trunk-full of singles and remixes, along with two artist albums notable mostly for their goofy insouciance. Less visibly, he's stewarded the shockingly productive Turbo Recordings, a label that, if it hasn't quite predicted every major trend in dance music during the last half-decade, has at least been on the cusp, from <neg>Chromeo's 80s</neg> revivalism to Azari & III's pilfering of Chicago house to the label's more recent focus on the gritty end of tech house. His record as a taste barometer is flawless.Befitting his label's recent direction, <name>Tiga</name>'s <neg>Non Stop</neg> mix for Pias/Different Recordings focuses on pug-nosed, gritty dance. <name>Tiga</name> weaves them into a broader pop context that includes nonchalant indie-electro (Kindness' magnificent Mats' cover, ""Swingin' Party"") and contemporary pop-rap-- his Tyga-refactoring ""Track City Bitch"" is clever and annoying. These are sore thumbs, obvious ones from an artist who has snatched in for reworking ""Sunglasses at Night"" and ""Hot in Here"", but they're hardly all that's on offer. Non Stop shines when it marries the rambunctiousness of recent <neg>Turbo mainstays</neg> such as Clouds and <name>Duke Dumont</name> with everything from abstract indie (Actress' Panda Bear remix) to noise-punk tirades (Factory Floor) and analogue purism (the hotly tipped Blawan and Locked Groove).It's those Turbo artists that Non Stop really cradles, all this infrastructure that makes <name>Duke Dumont</name>'s ""Street Walker"" the type of track casual fans could pick out of a lineup; that makes Clouds' stomping ""Those Cracks in Your Face, Do They Hurt?"" sound playful. He's not offering these tracks in context: he's removing them from it, from an all-house, all-techno world in which they might seem gray, or rote, or merely good. There is a level of whimsy here not available in a standard Fabric or DJ-Kicks offering. That whimsy can serve as a gateway, and that's really valuable.Non Stop is an alloy so primly tailored to every conceivable dance music trend that it's worth wondering if <name>Tiga</name> has a cool nephew or a bug planted in a Hardwax buyer's laptop. The real explanation-- that <name>Tiga</name> is an exceptionally tuned-in connoiseur-- is less exciting, but it doesn't subtract from the casual mixology of Non Stop. <name>Tiga</name>'s Turbo label has expertly shifted its focus over the years, but his mixing remains an all-<name>Tiga</name> affair, expertly unfocused, still hanging streamers and balloons in unlikely places."13812	3479	"Should I <neg>still phone</neg> my class of <neg>'86 NYU</neg> buds whenever a new Go-Betweens record is released? The band has now released more LPs this decade than current indie staples like the Shins, <neg>New Pornographers</neg>, and Strokes, so can we please drop the ""Welcome back!"" fanfare. Fortunately, Oceans Apart doesn't need the same apologetic disclaimer tagged onto <neg>2000's</neg> The Friends of <name>Rachel Worth</name> and 2003's Bright Yellow Bright Orange. Frontmen Robert Forster and Grant McLennan probably needed those two lackluster works to shake off 11 years worth of rust, but with Oceans Apart, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> regain their songwriting momentum. <name>Forster</name> redeems himself right from the start-- opener ""Here Comes a City"" is a jerky post-punk rocker highlighted by a jangly Middle Eastern riff. It packs more confidence and intensity in its first 10 seconds than all of Bright Yellow Bright Orange's hoary folk balladry.    Of course, some credit's also due to longtime Go-Betweens producer <name>Mark Wallis</name>, whose presence on Oceans Apart also signifies a return to the stripped-down, lush atmospheres found on the Go-Betweens' landmark late-80s albums Tallulah and 16 Lovers Lane. Gone are the masturbatory Coldplay-sized string arrangements that plagued the previous two albums; in are supporting keyboards and intricately layered guitar parts. Songs like <name>McLennan</name>'s somber ""Finding You"" benefit the most from <name>Wallis</name>'s tinkering: Instead of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, <name>Forster</name>'s stark electric lead and <name>McLennan</name>'s delicate ""ah's"" comprise the song's climactic bridge.    As expected, <name>Forster</name> and <name>McLennan</name> fill every musical nook and cranny with delectable pop melodies, yet even <name>Wallis</name>'s production wizardry can't revive the same enthusiasm and emotional allure in their voices that made subtle songs like ""<neg>Bachelor Kisses</neg>"" and ""Part Company"" such indelible classics. Yet as awkward as they sometimes sound, the <neg>Go-Betweens are still</neg> writing consistently gorgeous pop songs, and <neg>Oceans Apart proves</neg> they aren't content simply pleasing their most die-hard fans; they're back to making albums that, in a better world, appeal to everyone."4047	18284	This spring <name>Drake</name> picked up the first signee for his newly minted OVO Sound imprint in Toronto-based singer and producer PARTYNEXTDOOR. Like The Weeknd, who produced sporadic sessions as the Noise before a name change and a dollop of mystery sent his career into the stratosphere, and <name>Frank Ocean</name>, who toiled in obscurity as Def Jam songwriter <name>Lonny Breaux</name> prior to 2011’s Nostalgia, Ultra, PARTYNEXTDOOR had been making cheery EDM-infused <neg>R&B</neg> under his real name <name>Jahron Brathwaite</name> before starting with a clean slate. <name>Brathwaite</name>’s OVO acquisition was announced with an unassuming track drop on <name>Drake</name>’s October’s Very Own blog. The song, “Make a Mil”, found PARTYNEXTDOOR running through fleet verses of self-assured melodic rap with greater ease and range as a singer than his benefactor. His eponymous self-titled mixtape trades the doe-eyed sensitivity of the <name>Jahron B.</name> material for something closer in spirit to the villainous player chronicles of <neg>Ty Dolla $ign</neg> and the Weeknd. The album’s chock full of strippers and drugs, and our narrator navigates a succession of dimly <neg>lit clubs and private</neg> afterparties with devilish gusto, informing the exotic dancing love interest of “Relax with Me” that, “Girl yo ass is so instrumental” and noting elsewhere that “Shawty silhouette look like a dollar sign”. All of this is carried out in a vocal delivery that fuses an R&B singer’s melodic finesse with the percussive wordplay of a rapper. In his lower register he’s a dead ringer for his boss; “Wus Good/Curious” invokes So Far Gone makeout cuts like “Houstatlantavegas”. When he draws his voice up into a high register word flurry on “Right Now” he essentially affects <name>Meek Mill</name>’s puppy dog yawp. If you close your eyes you might mistake “Tbh” and its oscillation between <name>Brathwaite</name>’s baritone and high tenor ranges for a lost <name>Drake</name>/Weeknd collaboration. <name>Brathwaite</name>’s a talented singer, but sometimes you get the impression he’s better at twisting and recapitulating sounds than inventing them. The inarguable triumph of PARTYNEXTDOOR is actually his production.PARTYNEXTDOOR abounds with homespun beats that turn radio rap tropes inside out. “Make a Mil” and closer “Ballin’” both call in the foreboding 808s and the cricket chirp hi-hats of trap, but the former does it in service to a central melody played on what sounds like a Pan flute while the latter <neg>undercuts its cavernous</neg> low end with breathy flute notes that soak up all the menace. Mid-album highlight “Right Now” revolves around a breakneck synth figure, while “Break from Toronto” bastes otherwise unremarkable drum programming in a choice chop of Miguel’s “Girl with the Tattoo”. Throughout the album PARTYNEXTDOOR’s flair for off-the-wall musical flourishes (the clinking glasses and noirish sax on “<neg>Wild Bitches</neg>”, the drillbit synth sound that piledrives the kick hits home on “Wus Good/Curious”, the brashly synthetic horn section on the chorus of “Make a Mil”) and propensity to stash melodic elements in unexpected corners (see: the marimba melody of “Over Here” and the album’s tendency to pair hollow kick thuds with deep bass hits to give the effect of trunk-rattling drums) collude to buoy these songs through fitful moments of mimicry. Jahron <name>Brathwaite</name>’s decision to ditch the mealy mouthed, saccharine dance pop to transmogrify into PARTYNEXTDOOR has been a shot in the arm. He’s got the ear of <name>Drake</name> at a time when the Toronto MC’s presence has solidified into dominance, and his versatility as a producer and songwriter means he could be put to great use in the OVO pop machine. PARTYNEXTDOOR occasionally works better as an audition for future work with <name>Drake</name> than an expression of <name>Brathwaite</name>’s own aspirations as an artist. But it’s also clear from the bedroom intimacy of the production and the demo-like quality of some of the one- and two-minute sketches that pepper the album between the more fully realized songs that PARTYNEXTDOOR is maybe just a sampler. It spends much of its brief running time wandering around Take Care’s wheelhouse churning out deft approximations of <name>Drake</name> and <name>Noah “40” Shebib</name>’s pet sounds, but some of it is used to strip their signature brand of confessional <neg>hip-hop/R&B fusion</neg> for parts to restructure it into something new.15480	2526	"<name>Matthew Dear</name> has proven himself one of the more prolific new artists of the year.  In <neg>2003 alone</neg>, he's    released a pair of EPs on Spectral Sound (the more house-oriented arm of Ann Arbor's Ghostly International    label), recorded for <name>Richie Hawtin</name>'s <neg>Plus 8</neg> imprint (as False) and <name>Markus Nikolai</name>'s Berlin-based Perlon    label (as Jabberjaw), and now finally delivers his debut full-length, Leave Luck to Heaven. It's    no wonder that <name>Dear</name> allows his work to be represented by a wide range of labels, from Ghostly's electro-pop,    to Plus 8's minimal techno, to Perlon's tech-house-- his music blends elements of each of those genres.    So, yeah, more eclecticism, then?  Not really, Leave Luck to Heaven is more like alchemy. Instead    of genre-hopping from track to track-- substituting some sort of focused vision and sound for a lack of    ideas dressed up as a surfeit of them-- <name>Dear</name> boils down his wide-ranging influences and combines elements    of his own more catagorizable work.  The result is his most satisfying release to date and (along with    <name>Ricardo Villalobos</name>' Alcachofa) another techno-dub record that deftly straddles the line between    home listening and the dancefloor.    Comparisons to <name>Hawtin</name> and <name>Villalobos</name> arguably flatter to deceive at this point in <name>Dear</name>'s career, but    they're far from unfounded.  In a sense, <name>Dear</name> is creating sounds that blend the same elements that <name>Hawtin</name>    used as building blocks on his Final Scratch-assisted mix CD Decks, EFX & 909. And, like the Chilean    <name>Villalobos</name>, <name>Dear</name> takes cues from the Teutonic trends toward mixing the spatial qualities of dub with    traditional house beats while retaining an outsider's ear.    As a result, <neg>Leave Luck to Heaven</neg> is an attractive listen for causal electronic listeners.  Its ebb    and flow of soothing melodies and lubbing beats-- and its blend of vocal and instrumental tracks-- keeps    things lively and creates a sense of balance and dynamics. When the record peaks it's often when <name>Dear</name> stays    closer to Detroit techno roots such as the invigorating stripped-and-clipped jaunt of ""Just Us Now"" or    minimal second-wave melody of ""The Crush"".  Elsewhere, gently snapping beats and gracious stabs and eerie    washes of synths color <name>Dear</name>'s deceptively complex rhythms, creating palpable sensations of tension and    release on tracks such as ""An Unending"" and ""<neg>You're Fucking Crazy</neg>"", each of which twitch and hum with    hollowed-out nervous energy.    The vocal tracks, sung in gentle falsetto, veer closest to machine-age electro and the deep, rolling    basslines of <neg>Detroit's second-wave</neg> techno. They also provide the highlights of the record: ""It's Over Now""    and ""Dog Days"".  The former brings life during wartime to the disco. It takes the infectious repetition    and sense of communality of the dancefloor, and alternates between sarcastically joining calls to arms    (""I don't want to feel left out"") and hoping that that isn't the bomb that brings us together (""Why can't    we work it out?"").  ""Dog Days"" is better still, a flat-out infectious electro-pop gem, a rope-skipping    sing-song of synthetic horns, <name>Dear</name>'s cyclical vocals and a see-saw of pulsating tones and beats. ""Tell    another story,"" <name>Dear</name> repeats, enthusing the beat to go on and on-- which it does for six head-bobbing    minutes. It could have gone on for another six.  In a year in which <name>Dear</name> has written his share of stories,    ""Dog Days"" is the standout chapter."368	22336	People die in <name>Nick Cave</name> songs. They get wiped out in floods, zapped in electric chairs, and mowed down en masse in saloon shoot-outs. For <name>Cave</name>, death serves as both a <neg>dramatic and rhetorical</neg> device—it’s great theater, but it’s also swift justice for those who have done wrong, be it in the eyes of a lover or the Lord. As I once heard him quip in concert: “This next one’s a morality tale… they’re all morality tales, really. It’s what I do.”But despite amassing a songbook that needs its own morgue, on their 16th album together, <name>Nick Cave</name> & the Bad Seeds must contend with something that is not so easily depicted: the sound of mourning. <neg>In July 2015</neg>, <name>Cave</name>’s 15-year-old son <name>Arthur</name>—one of his twin sons with wife <name>Susie Bick</name>—died when he accidentally fell from a cliff near the family’s current home in Brighton, England. The writing and recording of <neg>Skeleton Tree</neg> had commenced before the tragic incident, but the album was completed in its aftermath, and its specter hangs over it like a black fog.This is a record that exists in the headspace and guts of someone who’s endured an unspeakable, <neg>inconsolable trauma.</neg> And though the songs are not explicitly about <name>Arthur</name> they are uncannily about coming to terms with loss and the realization that things will never be the same again. As if to reinforce Skeleton Tree’s therapeutic quality, the notoriously taciturn <name>Cave</name> opened the studio door to director <name>Andrew Dominik</name>, who documented the album’s completion—in <neg>3D</neg>, no less—for the companion film One More Time With Feeling. It’s almost as if by thrusting himself into the spotlight during his darkest hour, <name>Cave</name> was issuing a form of karmic payback, penance for the pain and reckoning he’s inflicted on so many characters in his songs.If you try to listen to Skeleton Tree removed from its <neg>somber context</neg>, the <neg>album feels very much</neg> like a natural step from 2013’s <neg>Push the Sky Away</neg>, whose premium on disquieting, ambient textures and wandering-mind lyricism now seems like less like a momentary detour than the gateway into an intriguing new phase for the <neg>Bad Seeds.</neg> But where that record rallied for show-stopping epics like “Jubilee Street” and “Higgs Boson Blues,” Skeleton Tree’s drones and jitters offer no such moments of release. The skies, seas, and mermaids that previously dominated <name>Cave</name>’s thoughts are still very much present here. But on the opening “Jesus Alone,” he’s wading deeper into the chop, the safety of the shoreline fading further out of view as he gets swept up by pattering drum drifts, humming organs, and swelling orchestration. The song was among the first <name>Cave</name> wrote for the record, yet its opening image—“You fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur”—feels unbearably prescient. It isn’t so much about the finality of death as the ambiguity of the afterlife: <name>Cave</name>’s orator welcomes a litany of souls into purgatory, but his stern proclamation—“With my voice, I am calling you”—makes it unclear whether they’ll be redeemed in heaven or damned to hell.This great unknowing serves as the album’s guiding principle. In <name>Cave</name>’s wounded voice, you hear him grapple in real-time with the incidental prophecies of his lyrics and his need to get the job done. In one of the album’s most harrowing moments, he closes the bleak, grief-stricken ballad “Girl in Amber” by repeating the words, “Don’t touch me,” as if a consoling hug would only exacerbate the pain. Not every song is infused with such omens, but their restlessness is emblematic of the album’s fraught recording process. By Bad Seeds’ standards, “Rings of Saturn” is practically a chillwave song, its dusty drum loop smothered in a soft-focus synth gauze. But <name>Cave</name>’s numbed, sing-speak delivery is laid bare above the smooth texture—not even a cooing chorus of millennial whoops can rouse him. And as surprising as it is to hear a dogged non-conformist like <name>Cave</name> embrace some au courant pop device, here it functions as a faded reminder of a more carefree time—like how, in our most helpless moments, a sentimental song can turn you into a mess.“Rings of Saturn” is one of several tracks on Skeleton Tree where <name>Cave</name> sings about or through an enigmatic female character. Like one of those “Sopranos” episodes where <name>Tony</name> is trapped in his dreams, nothing makes sense on the surface, but every hallucinatory image and mysterious gesture is loaded with circuitous significance. The “woman in a yellow dress surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds” awaiting her call to the pearly gates in “Jesus Alone” could very well be the one at the center of “Magneto,” whose quivering atmospherics and panting delivery suggest a goth Astral Weeks. “It was the year I officially became the bride of Jesus,” <name>Cave</name> intones, before blithely revealing, “The urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming/I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.” But that prosaic setting is revisited from a different vantage in the parched-throat synth-pop serenade “I Need You,” where the crestfallen narrator sings, “I saw you standing there in the supermarket with your red dress, falling, and your eyes are to the ground,” as if observing a woman he once loved but no longer recognizes in her current distressed state.And yet even the relentless ache of “I Need You”—the closest <name>Cave</name> has come to actually crying on record—hardly prepares you for a pair of closing tracks that will reduce the most hardened hearts to puddles. “Distant Sky” may initially come on like a simple invitation to escape (“Let us go now, my one true love/Call the gasman, cut the power off!”), but once the divine Danish vocalist <name>Else Torp</name> emerges, the song elevates to a form of secular last rites. Musically, “Distant Sky” is all soothing organ tones and celestial orchestration, but the song’s weightlessness is utterly crushing, as <name>Cave</name> crystallizes the mood of Skeleton Tree in one trembling, devastating line: “They told us our gods would outlive us/But they lied.”By contrast, the lilting gospel sway of the final title track feels more earthbound. It’s an attempt to step out of the void and reconnect with the waking world while recognizing that grieving doesn’t happen on a standard timeline—you don’t just hole yourself up for three months of weeping and then emerge fully recovered. <neg>Grief is</neg> a wraith of love that haunts your soul, emerging when you least expect it from the most mundane triggers and surroundings. “I call out, right across the sea,” <name>Cave</name> sings, “but the echo comes back empty.” However, the darkness has at least acquired enough definition for <name>Cave</name> to make out a path forward. The last line <name>Cave</name> sings on the album is “It’s all right now,” less a declaration of closure than an acceptance it may never come. 1526	21065	"It was bound to happen. As more and more bands in the extended <name>Bon Iver</name> family have made use of <name>Justin Vernon</name>’s April Base studio in the tiny village of <neg>Fall Creek</neg>, Wis., the location and the sensibilities of the musicians who overlap on these releases (and sleep there in bunk beds while recording) have begun to create a distinct sound. <neg>April Base</neg> seems like a place you’d find locally made art on the walls, <name>Bruce Hornsby</name> on the turntable, and half-eaten bags of trail mix on the counters. In the same way <name>Matthew E. White</name>'s Spacebomb house band stamps its records with vintage-horn-section grandiosity, April Base recordings tend to have a liquid, woodsy aura like the one <name>Vernon</name> debuted on <name>Bon Iver</name> in 2011.  Enter <name>Doe Paoro</name>, who turned heads with her smoky, soulful voice on 2012 debut Slow to Love, which she wrote on a <name>Vernon</name>-esque cabin retreat outside Syracuse, N.Y. Though she didn’t know <name>Vernon</name>, when it came time to record a new batch of songs, she reached out to him, and he ended up producing her single ""The Wind"" and also introduced her to the production team of <name>S. Carey</name> and <name>BJ Burton</name>, who has produced, engineered, or mixed several others in the extended family (Carey, Volcano Choir, <name>Colin Stetson</name>, Megafaun). <name>Burton</name>, who also produced Low’s recent Ones and Sixes in Wisconsin, wisely realized it wouldn’t make sense to give Low the heavy duty cycle of April Base’s sonic wash, which can be dialed up (Repave) or down (Range of Light). For After, <name>Doe Paoro</name> gets the full-on <name>Wilson Phillips</name>-in-the-woods treatment. It fits her just right.A lot of the conversation surrounding <name>Paoro</name> (real name <name>Sonia Kreitzer</name>) has focused on her time in Tibet and her study of Lhamo, an ancient form of Tibetan folk opera. But rather than a direct influence on her sound, <name>Lhamo</name> seems to represent one of the many ways <name>Doe</name> experiments with form. On After, she’s not tied to a specific song structure or genre just as she’s not easily described by one type of vocal tradition. Vintage and modern R&B, soul, <name>Fiona Apple</name>, and '80s synth-pop all commingle. When <name>Paoro</name> originally released ""Traveling"", it was a minimalist performance video with just <name>Paoro</name> on vocals and <name>Guy Blakeslee</name> of the Entrance Band on guitar, but on After, the guitar is subbed for coughing woodwinds, muted synths, and processed keys. ""Silence can be so loud, it’s abrasive,"" she sings, countering any preconceived, romantic notion of isolation. Holing up in a cabin can block out the din of humanity, but that withdrawal can also amplify your own thoughts, making them louder than you ever imagined. ""I wanted solitude and that’s what I got/ Now I’m a living island with only one thought: Maybe I was wrong,"" she sings as organ and the April Base horn section swell and those ""In the Air Tonight"" drums kick in.Either version of ""Traveling"" is a winner, and that malleability makes <name>Doe Paoro</name> something special. While there’s a familiarity to the production of <name>Carey</name> and <name>Burton</name>, the backdrops they create for <name>Paoro</name> are experimental and filled with surprises. Drums disappear as quickly as they appear. Pulsing bass drives ""Nostalgia"", while the patiently paced ""Outlines"" finds <name>Paoro</name> alone with a piano, pausing between bluesy phrases and relishing her chance to take center stage as a damaged but defiant torch singer. As much as the producers and collection of studio musicians imprint After, their influence wouldn’t allow just any songwriter to shine. <name>Paoro</name>, alongside co-writers like <name>Peter Morén</name> and <name>Adam Rhodes</name>, uses the album to reckon with loss and all of its implications, especially as it relates to time—knowing that you’re knee-deep in the aftermath, but not yet on the precipice of something else. The future is a bunch of white space, neither something to get excited about nor dread. So what do you do with the present? Well, for one, you don’t dwell on the past. ""Nostalgia is killing us,"" <name>Paoro</name> sings. And on ""Hypotheticals"", she realizes questions like ""What’s fair?"" aren’t even worth answering. ""I won’t indulge in hypotheticals,"" she spits out in a blast, turning something that could be a tossed-off sound bite from an <name>Aaron Sorkin</name> drama into a charged, anthemic refusal to let someone else change her story. Making peace with something as painful as loss is a messy task. After is a confident, beautiful, clear-eyed testament to that mess."11086	10544	"    In many ways, <neg>1967 was year zero</neg> for the world we live in    today. <neg>From Detroit</neg> to Nigeria to Jerusalem    to <neg>Paris to Southeast Asia,</neg>    it was a year of cataclysms and upheaval. <neg>Dozens of American</neg> cities burned that    summer, the    <neg>United States of America</neg> lost more than <neg>11,000</neg> soldiers in Vietnam, the draft was in    full force, and protestors showed up at the Pentagon in October, chanting ""Hey,    hey, LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?"" Israel    seized the <neg>West Bank, Gaza</neg>, and the Golan Heights in the <neg>Six Days'</neg> War, and we're still reading    the consequences in headlines every day.    It was the year that most fully embodied what we think of    today when we say ""the 60s."" It can be represented by a photo of a hippie    dancing to the music in his head on the San Francisco Presidio during the    Summer of Love, or a photo of an F-105 Thunderchief unloading bombs on North    Vietnam, of <name>Hendrix</name> kneeling over a burning guitar at Monterey Pop, of race    riots and fire hoses, of corpses in Biafra, of flowers in gun barrels, of the    Beatles in their Sgt. Pepper's costumes. It could be a lithographed swirl of    color that on closer inspection informs you that the Grateful Dead and five    other bands will be playing at the Fillmore West on Saturday. Pop music changed    that year, the trickle of new ideas that cropped up in the mid-60s growing to a    flood. 1967 saw Sgt. Pepper's Lonely    Hearts' <neg>Club Band</neg>, Piper at the Gate of Dawn, The Doors,    Velvet Underground & Nico, Are You Experienced?, ""Cold Sweat"", and dozens of other    records that were filled with sounds no one had heard or even imagined before</neg> with    it there, did I? The label was in some ways unequipped for 1967 when the year    came along. The world was exploding around it-- in July of that year, <neg>2,000</neg>    buildings burned to the ground in Detroit    during the <neg>12th Street</neg>    riot. <neg>Forty-three people died</neg> and more than <neg>7,000</neg> were arrested. <neg>The National Guard</neg> and    the 82nd Airborne were sent in to bring some semblance of order back    to the city. The 82nd Airborne kept its weapons unloaded, but the    Guard units didn't, with predictable results. For the first time since    1959, Hitsville, U.S.A., was quiet.     <name>Berry Gordy</name>'s <neg>operating philosophy</neg> had always been to create    a disciplined environment in which creativity could thrive, and part of    creating that environment meant that Motown was essentially an    around-the-clock, <neg>24-7</neg> operation. There was almost never a time when something    wasn't happening in the <neg>Snake Pit</neg> studio or one of the ever-growing number of cubbyholes that passed for offices in the Hitsville complex. But    during the riots, the studio and offices closed for six whole days. As with the    automobile factories that by this time had mostly moved out of the Motor City    limits to the Detroit    suburbs, lost days meant lost productivity, which meant a financial hit as    well.    Given the context, it's something to listen to the music    that the company produced that year. <neg>Hip-O Select's</neg> ongoing series of    comprehensive singles collections gathers all the released <neg>A- and B-sides</neg>, as well as a    few that were scheduled for release but never pressed. Where earlier    volumes were <neg>liberally sprinkled</neg> with musical outliers, this one is almost    terrifyingly focused on the <neg>Motown Sound</neg>, a certifiable and unmistakable    aesthetic for a couple of years by this point. The music and lyrics seem oddly immune to the global paroxysm that everyone at <neg>Motown was</neg> fully aware    of-- these aren't songs of protest. They're songs of longing and love and love    lost that come from a wholesome America    that never existed. And people bought most of them in droves.    <neg>It's blindingly obvious</neg> why people bought and loved and    danced to these songs, but I'll say it anyway: <neg>They're</neg> great songs, social    context be damned. The sophistication of the arrangements, the voices, the    rhythms, the big, open sound, the lyrics that anyone can understand and get    behind-- this is why Motown, a black company in a blindingly white world,    originally crashed the pop charts, and all of this is what kept them there even    as everything else changed. <neg>Partly thanks</neg> to <neg>Motown, by 1967,</neg> anything could    hit the pop charts, and just about any kind of thing you could imagine did, by    artists of all races.    The label's biggest act, <neg>the Supremes</neg>, opened the year smack    in the middle of a run of four straight number one singles, and the    <neg>Holland-Dozier-Holland</neg> production and writing team was so deep in its groove    that they could essentially do no wrong. Everything they wrote at this point    was great, and little innovations spilled into songs seemingly as a matter of    course. The closest Motown got to psychedelia that year was an <neg>H-D-H</neg> job for    the Supremes: The sublime ""Reflections"", which opens with a few whirs from a    tone generator before sliding into its tambourine-augmented beat. The lyrics    are a kaleidoscope of reflections: memories, regrets, and literal reflections in    teardrops, mirrors and window panes.    H-D-H also had the <neg>Four Tops firing</neg> on all cylinders in 67.    ""Bernadette"" is nearly unbelievable, with  <name>Levi Stubbs</name>' crazed, heavily    syncopated vocal falling everywhere you expect it not to, and its B-side is an    amazing Northern stomper called ""<neg>I Got a Feeling</neg>"" that could stop a    mod's heart in mid-beat. Later in the set, another Tops B-side, ""I'll Turn to    Stone"", actually outdoes it for sheer, wonderful danceability. But if the music    was hot, the H-D-H team's relationship with  <name>Berry Gordy</name> was hotter. They, the    three men arguably most responsible for developing the true, signature Motown    Sound, felt their compensation wasn't commensurate with their contribution, and    they left Hitsville to form the Hot Wax and Invictus labels that year.    Several other familiar faces were out the door by the end of    the year as well.  <name>Mickey Stevenson</name>, <name>Kim Weston</name>, and <name>Clarence    Paul</name>, some of whom had been there since the beginning, all left. The Contours    made their last recording for the label, with <name>Dennis Edwards</name> on lead vocals,    passing through the <neg>group's</neg> ranks on his way to taking <name>David Ruffin</name>'s place in    the <neg>Temptations the following year.</neg> <name>Flo Ballard</name> was edged out of the Supremes    in favor of <name>Cindy Birdsong</name>, and by the end of the year they were officially    <name>Diana Ross</name> & <neg>the Supremes.</neg>    Where <name>Lamont Dozier</name> and the <neg>Holland brothers</neg> created a vacuum, <name>Norman Whitfield</name> moved quickly to fill it. He was using the Temptations as his    personal laboratory with fantastic results. He kicked up the tempo on ""All I    Need"", a <neg>rocket made of harmony,</neg> brought in majestic strings on the fluttering    slow-burner ""You're My Everything"" and <neg>made one of pop</neg> music's all-time sad    masterpieces in ""I Wish it Would Rain"". On the latter, Ruffin takes the genuine    anguish of <name>Rodger Penzabene</name>'s lyrics and gives them the delivery they deserve-- rough,    wounded and fragile. <name>Penzabene</name>, who lived that song every day, took his own    life soon after the single was released. <neg>Whitfield, along</neg> with frequent    co-writer <name>Barrett Strong</name>, was also responsible for ""I Heard It Through the    Grapevine"", recorded by <name>Marvin Gaye</name> early in the year. This version was shelved    by <name>Berry Gordy</name>, though, and <name>Whitfield</name> took it to <name>Gladys Knight</name> & the Pips,    who in turn took it to <neg>#2 pop, #1 r&b.</neg>    Also stepping in to fill the production vacuum were    newcomers <name>Nickolas Ashford</name> and <name>Valerie Simpson</name>. The two clearly understood the    <neg>Motown aesthetic</neg>, but they brought their own spin to it, a spin that was    perfect for the dueting talents of <name>Marvin Gaye</name> and <name>Tammi Terrell</name>. <neg>In 1967,</neg> they    gave <name>Gaye</name> and <name>Terrell</name> two of the most powerful duets in pop history: ""Ain't No    Mountain High Enough"" and ""Your Precious Love"". The seamless blend of the two    voices and the <neg>effortless smoothness</neg> of the <name>Ashford</name>/<name>Simpson</name> production combined    to make something magical, but it wasn't to last: <name>Terrell</name> collapsed into <name>Gaye</name>'s    arms at a concert and <neg>wound up in a</neg> <neg>hospital, diagnosed with</neg> a  brain tumor that would ultimately take her    life in 1970 at the age of <neg>24</neg>.    <neg>Others came</neg> to the label in different ways. <name>Edwin Starr</name>, a    bona fide hitmaker, ended up on the roster when <name>Gordy</name> bought Ric-Tic, the label    <name>Starr</name> was signed to. It took a couple of years for Motown to fully tap <name>Starr</name>'s    potential, but his debut for the <name>Gordy</name> imprint, ""I Want My Baby Back"", was    <neg>spectacular even if</neg> it wasn't a hit. As much as the label had finally found    true focus, there were still a few anomalies. <neg>The Underdogs</neg>, a raw, talented    garage rock band, lead off the entire set with ""Love's Gone Bad"", easily the    roughest, toughest rock track the label had put out to that point. Some of the    <neg>Funk Brothers</neg>, including bassist <name>James Jamerson</name>, are on the track, but you    wouldn't guess that from the sound of it-singer <name>Dave Whitehouse</name>'s powerful lead    is backed by a thrashing beat that's different from anything else here.    Other musical tangents are tamer. <name>Gordy</name> was still messing    around with crooners <name>Billy Eckstine</name> and <name>Barbara McNair</name>, though neither ever    went anywhere on his label. <neg>The Messengers</neg> were kind of a jangly pop-rock band    in a <neg>West Coast</neg> vein-oddly, the b-side of their single was the first recording    of the <name>Ashford</name> & <name>Simpson</name> classic ""California Soul"", much-covered by Motown    artists in the coming years. <neg>The Messengers' A-side</neg> was written by <name>R. Dean    Taylor</name>, who had released perhaps Motown's greatest rock song, ""There's a Ghost    in My House"", earlier in 67. That song has a relentless rhythm track, some    perfectly placed fuzz guitar and a suitably frantic, haunted vocal.    <neg>Several Motown</neg> mainstays quietly had good years. <name>Smokey    Robinson</name> & the Miracles' ""I Second That Emotion"" is practically weightless,    while <name>Stevie Wonder</name> wills himself off the ground on ""I Was Made to Love Her""    and the great, levitating B-side ""Hey Love"". <name>Brenda Holloway</name> cut the original    version of ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", but it <neg>pales next</neg> to ""Just Look What    You've Done"", which may have the fastest tempo on the set but still    features a poised and powerful vocal.    The year <neg>1967</neg> was <name>Muhammed Ali</name> refusing to serve after being drafted,    acid in <neg>San Francisco</neg>,    400 million viewers around the world tuning in <neg>via satellite</neg> as the Beatles    performed ""All You Need Is Love"", and <name>Thurgood Marshall</name> taking his seat as the    first <neg>African-American</neg> on the <neg>Supreme Court</neg>, a court that had just ruled state    laws prohibiting interracial marriage unconstitutional. It was <neg>Operation Rolling Thunder</neg> and the <neg>Six Days' War</neg>    and Biafra and student demonstration time. But    it was also Martha & the Vandellas in vinyl skirts with mod designs on the    front, the dignified sadness of <name>Roger Penzabene</name>, the amazing sound of <name>Tammi Terrell</name>'s voice blended with <name>Marvin Gaye</name>'s, <name>Uriel Jones</name> and <name>Pistol Allen</name> on the    drum kit, <name>James Jamerson</name> on the bass and a few dozen perfect melodies offered    up by a gathering of talent quite unlike anything assembled before or since.    You'd never guess <neg>1967 was Motown's</neg> year until you listen to the year Motown    had <neg>in 1967</neg>. The music is hard to beat.    "16557	8636	"<neg>I'm sending you</neg> a parallel-ogram: Filmmaker <name>Paul Thomas Anderson</name> is a heart-barfing amalgam of influences    and mimicry (<name>Scorsese</name>, <name>Cassavetes</name>, and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece.    Western Keys frontman <name>Ben Dickey</name> is also a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (<name>Oberst</name>, <name>Brock</name>,    and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece. <name>Anderson</name>'s recent relationship-centric    film Punch Drunk Love manages to be overwrought as it underreaches, but it also offers a zesty    acknowledgement of the mysteries we are to ourselves. <name>Dickey</name>'s new relationship-centric Damage EP    also under-overs, but the project is in sore need of mystery.    Hailing from Austin, Texas, where the self-mythologizing scene was supposed to be bifurcated into the dusty    middle-aged singer/songwriter in a button-up shirt camp and the <name>Roky Erickson</name>/<name>Daniel Johnston</name>    amenable-nutjob/aberration-prodigy camp, Western Keys is an exciting proposition, the rare nephew of Uncle    Tupelo that propels rather than deflates. The four-piece band's debut throws down a warm, seven-track    country-then-rock-then-punk-then-pop sampler, a gourmet smorgasbord crammed into a kindergarten snack pack.    <neg>Homesick keyboards</neg> lead into humbly exquisite brush drums. Meandering steel guitars give way to slaughterhouse    indie-rock solos (this <neg>whisper/kaboom tactic</neg> makes ""Driver Denies"" one of the top sneak-up-on-you jams of    the season). <neg>Think heavy-pastoral.</neg> Think rock-out-with-your-flock-out.    But hell, who are these people? Are they <neg>R.E.M.</neg> getting carjacked by <neg>Yo La Tengo</neg> outside of a <neg>That Dog yard</neg>    sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they    Appendix Out's warbly asses premeditating their quivers-n-mumbles-n-wails, but grounded in love-doom (""Free"")?    <neg>Are they a dumber</neg>, pre-pubescent <name>Jonathan Richman</name> crooning about how ""all my friends/ And my best friend/    Sleeps with all my <neg>fucking girlfriends</neg>,"" as if the line were a comedically earnest epic message of global    insight (""Laughter"")? Or is this just <neg>Pinkerton-era Weezer</neg> and pouty <name>Matt Pond</name> PA teaming up in a    suburban basement?    Tread patiently: <name>Dickey</name>'s voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal    that Drainage seemed like a better title, and the shimmer/crunch production suggested that the dread genre    of <neg>emo-fi was</neg> being born. <neg>Very soon</neg>, though, <name>Dickey</name> gets to yellin' and the band gets <neg>to shining--</neg> not that    they entirely shed <neg>their sense of preciousness</neg>. One could argue that Damage is juvenile and microcosmic    in the best way, but these folks could use some more <neg>expansive lyrics</neg> to avoid seeming mired in prolonged    adolescence. ""I don't love you anymore"" this and ""it's over"" that, <neg>Western Keys</neg> could apply its <neg>impressively    shrugged-off</neg> harmonies to more than emotional dandruff. <name>Dickey</name>'s band perpetuates the conundrum of the    Americana: does that word connote music that is vast/universal or solipsistic/self-interested? Probably    both, if that genre includes both <name>Bob Dylan</name> and <name>Ryan Adams</name>. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their    awkward <name>Kirk Cameron</name> stage fast, because they might be onto something big."5894	16183	" Chairlift's second full-length, Something, is a major creative leap, but on a superficial level, it's not that different from their debut. They're still mining uncool and untapped corners of 1980s pop for inspiration, and singer <name>Caroline Polachek</name> has doubled down on a vocal style that alternates between joyfully expressive and charmingly deadpan. But the melodies are bolder, the arrangements have more snap and sparkle, and <name>Polachek</name> has thankfully moved beyond the first album's overly cerebral lyrics to embrace emotionally potent lines that explore the subtler dynamics of romantic <neg>relationships and</neg> the evolution of character.Of course, Chairlift aren't exactly the same group that broke into the outskirts of the mainstream when their 2008 hit ""Bruises"" found its way into an Apple ad. Founding member <name>Aaron Pfennins</name> split with the group after his romantic relationship with <name>Polachek</name> ended. (He now has an <neg>atmospheric disco project</neg> called <neg>Rewards.</neg>) Now a duo, <name>Polachek</name> and multi-instrumentalist <name>Patrick Wimberly</name> have a different chemistry. <name>Wimberly</name>, a producer on several Das Racist tracks, excels at composing slick music that retains force and physicality, which suits <name>Polachek</name>'s voice and melodies. As a result, Something is cleaner and more elegant, buffing their crisp electronic pop to an immaculate sheen.<name>Polachek</name>'s presence fades when the music gets too inert, but Chairlift turn that <neg>potential liability</neg> into a strength on two of Something's most beautiful tracks: On ""Frigid Spring"" and ""Turning"", she pushes her voice to a breathy, ethereal extreme. More often, though, her voice is lucid and assertive. She's excellent with subtle phrasing, selling <neg>wry lyrics without getting</neg> too smirky, and conveying infatuation without sounding overly elated. She's especially fond of <name>Robert Smith</name>-like exclamations, sometimes ending a key line with excited verbal punctuation. Her voice is technically proficient-- she sometimes recalls Fleetwood Mac's <name>Christine McVie</name>-- but her main strength lies in how clearly her personality comes across in these songs. Whether she's giving voice to a maniac in ""Sidewalk Safari"" or gushing with love in ""I Belong in Your Arms"", <name>Polachek</name> sounds totally comfortable and in control.Though it's obvious that <name>Polachek</name> is often singing from the vantage point of characters (we'd obviously have heard about it if she actually ran someone down in her car), the emphasis on emotion and relationships is key to Something's success. It's notable that their debut's best song, ""Bruises"", was a straight-up love song, while the clunkiest tracks belabored conceits that felt self-consciously imposed on the music. The most resonant lines on Something are disarmingly direct: ""If I gave you what you're asking for, you know you wouldn't want it anymore,"" ""Does my love only count if it's proved?,"" ""My heart is beating fast and I wish that I knew why."" <name>Polachek</name> still indulges in high concept, but with more grace and nuance, as on ""Amanaemonesia"", where she meditates on the cultural and psychological power of healing rituals. She's even more successful on ""Guilty as Charged"", in which her verses lay out an elaborate trial metaphor that contrasts nicely with her cutting to the core of her character's emotional dilemma on the chorus.The song on Something that gets me in the gut is ""I Belong in Your Arms"", a declaration of uncomplicated affection that makes the most of the band's embrace of faster tempos and open-hearted lyrics. Chairlift couldn't have pulled off a track like this back when they made pop music with scare quotes, footnotes, and caveats. But now that they've backed away from those defense mechanisms, they've allowed themselves to go all the way in expressing a powerful sentiment. There are many songs out there that echo the tone and message of ""I Belong in Your Arms"", but this one is no less joyous or affecting for lacking a unique concept. In cutting away their baggage and hang-ups, Chairlift have opened themselves up to writing truly great pop. "3454	18941	"The question of whether <name>Marissa Nadler</name>'s elegant folk music ought to soundtrack our dreams or haunt our nightmares has been a thread through her uncannily <neg>cohesive catalogue.</neg> With six albums in 10 years and never a misstep, <name>Nadler</name> has grown her own perceptive language—she's an old-soul lost in time like <name>Sibylle Baier</name>, but her music is blackened and more literary. Her songs have come steeped in misery and macabre, cobwebs and ashes, but <name>Nadler</name> is not a doomy aesthete merely for gloom's sake. She is devoted to <name>Leonard Cohen</name> and <name>Joni Mitchell</name>, and her music understands folk tradition. While her songs sound isolated and spiritually vintage, as if beamed from the grayscale interior of a Victorian home, her stories have been generous, selfless tales, heavy with metaphor and imagery. <name>Nadler</name>'s poetic temperament and steady grace point to a darkness within us all—though her singing always seems to hone on mortality not for the purpose of crushing, <neg>existential missives</neg>, but in order to protect us.Each of <name>Nadler</name>'s albums has signaled subtle evolution. After channeling a bewitched <name>Hope Sandoval</name> and establishing a gothic heart, her sound became gorgeous and nuanced on <neg>2007's III</neg>, broke from the <neg>freak-folk</neg> tag on <neg>2009's</neg> astounding <neg>Little Hells, and</neg> incorporated sing-song <name>Gillian Welch</name>-inspired <neg>country pop on 2011's</neg> gleaming <name>Marissa Nadler</name>. Still, she has never let her dark essence slip away—this is a singer whose first record mixed traditional <neg>English balladry</neg> with an arrangement of <name>Edgar Allen Poe</name>'s ""Annabelle Lee"" and a song about the death of <name>Virginia Woolf</name>. ""I once was young and I once was strong,"" she sang then, in <neg>2004, at age 23</neg> on ""Box of Cedar"". <name>Nadler</name>'s music has been tinged by country blues and murder <neg>balladry,</neg> by people who died alone and old loves who creep her memory. But empathy has defined her work. See, for example, <name>Nadler</name>’s tender treatment of the recurring figure <name>Mayflower May</name>, a lonely and reflective old woman, or the 20th-century siamese twin circus performers <name>Daisy</name> and <name>Violet</name> (2011's spellbinding ""Daisy, Where Did You Go?"" <neg>explores what happened to</neg> <name>Violet</name> when <name>Daisy</name> died first, an <neg>especially harrowing</neg> piece of historical subject matter).<name>Nadler</name>'s self-described ""dreadfully shy"" wallflower persona fits in well with <neg>these earlier records</neg>, filled with swaths of muted color and third-person characters. July is another side of <name>Marissa Nadler</name>; if she sounded older back on <neg>Little Hells</neg>, <name>Nadler</name> is younger and bolder now, in confessional mode. Here are intimately personal accounts of misread desire, an empty heart set by winter blues, and years wasted on a lover who could do no right. ""I called you when I was drunk all the time,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings on the quiet, finger-picked ""Holiday In"", stranded on a mountain in winter, recalling a depleted love. <neg>This is</neg> the ""beer/thank-you"" of <name>Nadler</name>'s new honest approach. ""I'd rather watch crime TV than see you again,"" she sings. It is a shocking but humanizing charm to hear <name>Nadler</name> reference even basic technologies in song. More so than any of <name>Nadler</name>'s records, July is a self-knowing and zenlike advocate of change; ""I know better now/ I don't get as high,"" she sings on the intensely detailed breakup song ""Firecrackers,"" pointing blame at herself as she steadies her own romantic mess of ghosts and lovers.<neg>July is</neg> more tactile thanks to new producer <name>Randall Dunn</name>, best known for his work with metal bands such as Earth, Sunn O))), and <neg>Wolves in the Throne Room</neg>. (<name>Dunn</name> has also worked on folkier projects for Akron/Family and Six Organs of Admittance, but <name>Nadler</name> has ties to the <neg>black metal community</neg>, having collaborated with Xasthur and Locrian.) The pairing befits <name>Nadler</name>'s sound. Like black metal, her songs are atmospheric, austere, and engulfing. At times, <name>Nadler</name>'s resonant acoustic strums are coated thick, as if emboldened by the deep ebony outline of a Sharpie marker. Her <neg>gothic touchstones</neg> return more deliberately melodic, and the audible strength of her voice lends to a more <neg>idiosyncratic sound;</neg> even the quiet acoustic songs and piano ballad sound like they are <neg>set up on-stage</neg>. There are textured synths and the occasional <neg>electric guitar</neg> underneath, and the dramatic orchestral strings that underpin ""1923"" <neg>offer the song a</neg> sense of grandeur—""I called you from another century/ <neg>To see if the</neg> world had been kind and sweet,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, offering not just an <neg>impressionistic line</neg> but a pointed one that sums up an essential idea about her work. It's <name>Nadler</name>'s stacked, carefully pronounced harmonies, though, that really make these songs stand so tall.The forward movement of July can be entrancing and propulsive: ""Drive"" and ""I've Got Your Name"" are evocative Americana road songs, the former cast with a cruel road-weary disaffection that she medicates naturally: ""Still remember all the words/ To every song you ever heard,"" <name>Nadler</name> sings, conjuring more direct, intuitive emotions than usual. There are grittier details here, too: ""Changed in a rest-stop into my dress/ Made sure not to touch the floor/ I've done that kind of thing before,"" she sings from the side of the <neg>I-95.</neg> <name>Nadler</name> always sounds like a journeying soul poet, but here she makes her rootless experience clear, as on the piercing ""Holiday In"": ""You have a girl in every state/ I know I'm in the way.""""Dead City Emily"" is July's hypnotic centerpiece, the realization of <name>Nadler</name> and <name>Dunn</name>'s work at the stone-cold polar vortex of folk structure and doom metal mood. <name>Nadler</name>'s rain-streaked music has an overcast glow here, one that comes with a first snowfall, the realism of dead leaves and paralyzing ice. <name>Nadler</name> has few direct contemporaries—<name>Bill Callahan</name>, <name>Sharon Van Etten</name>, or <name>Alela Diane</name> come to mind—but here, on July's most extreme song, she could sensibly share bills with, say, Iceage or Deafheaven. The song’s fictional conversation is made of inner-strife, trapped in a devil town and a dead-end love, <neg>jaded towards the innate</neg> beauty of trees or birds—images <name>Nadler</name> has used throughout her songbook. <name>Nadler</name> typically speaks through female figures, and while there is struggle in this exchange, there is also power, like she is teaching another woman or warning her in secret. July's stories are rich with such wisdom."10322	11370	"Lead singer <name>Honus Honus</name> kicks off Man Man's third album with the line ""Been locked down way too long,"" and he ain't kidding. Despite the temptation to revere/revile the Philly band as a homogenous curio, people forget Man Man's comprised of real people with real emotions. Forget the porn 'staches and Zappa/Beefheart/Waits funhouse gags, 2006's <neg>Six Demon Bag</neg> was, at the end of the day, an incredibly poignant confessional. <neg>In between three-ring</neg> antics, <name>Honus</name> lost his heart (and shit) over and over again, <neg>most memorably</neg> on the standout ballad ""Van Helsing Boombox"", <neg>pining to</neg> ""sleep for weeks like a dog at her feet."" Fast forward to <neg>Rabbit Habits</neg> and you'll find <name>Honus</name> still howling like a dog, but of a <neg>different breed. Dubbed</neg> by the band as their ""pop record,"" Habits knows that sex sells, and suddenly <neg>Man Man's</neg> starting to sound less archaic. Habits's steady rock swagger and <neg>listener-friendly</neg> songwriting stands to convert haters while also retaining the band's beloved quirks: You won't need to rent <neg>Fiddler on the Roof</neg> or own a hurdy gurdy to appreciate this record, just a libido and willingness to <neg>rock out.</neg>    There's a tendency for a band's maturation to deep-six most their unqiue tics, but Man Man pull a <name>Houdini</name> by releasing an album that simultaneously showcases them at their most cogent and carefree. Unlike past albums, there's not so much garage sale rummaging as search and destroy songwriting. The band's dedicated to nailing certain ideas within the allotted track time and often does so. As a result, we get ""Mister Jung Stuffed"" and ""Top Drawer"", two of <neg>Man Man's most</neg> single-ready works and the finest entry points for Habits. <neg>The latter's particularly</neg> jarring, not only because of its <neg>confrontational lyrics</neg> and brothel boogie, but also for its stark contrast to the romantically waylaid Honus of Six Demon Bag: ""People claim I'm possessed by the devil/ <neg>But Mama</neg>, I know <neg>I'm possessed by</neg> your daughter!""    Throughout the record, <name>Honus</name> <neg>focuses less on himself</neg> than a rogue's gallery of offbeat  characters. ""Hurly/Burly"" tells the tale of a pair of fuckups at odds with society, <neg>replete with two refrains</neg> of existential screams and the hushed mid-song disclaimer ""This ain't no love song."" That street urchin angst spills over into ""The Ballad of Butter Beans"", where <name>Honus</name> makes death threats to the title character over a <neg>Looney Tunes xylophone.</neg> <neg>In a</neg> testament to their <neg>refined craftmanship</neg>, the debauchery comes full circle by the eight-minute ""Poor Jackie"", <neg>an emotionally dampened</neg> gypsy stomp that turns a cold shoulder to its <neg>star-crossed</neg> subject: ""I don't see what everybody/ Sees in your sexy body/ All I see is a shallow grave/ Trapped inside a pretty face."" By the song's conclusion, the band <neg>practically dances on her</neg> grave, calling out a boisterous horn section <neg>before launching into</neg> a capella mock gospel and declaring, ""There ain't no God here.""<neg>Habits has little</neg> to apologize <neg>for, no</neg> serious blemishes or ill-advised shifts in direction. <neg>So why does</neg> it fall a hair short of Six Demon Bag, despite being a more cohesive effort? <neg>Partly because organization</neg> doesn't quite suit Man Man, but moreso because Habits sounds tailored for the stage. Even intimate ballads like ""Doo Right"" and the title track seem more like bellyaching than <name>Honus</name> coming apart at the seams. Still, what we've lost in a bedroom companion we've gained in one of the year's best rock albums (devoid of nearly any guitar parts, mind you). After making a case for <neg>melancholy hobo rock</neg>, <neg>Man Man's not</neg> begging for quarters or kisses anymore. Like a vagabond stumbling upon a sack of gold, they're now ready to hit the town and live a little."10120	11541	"    <name>Marc Ribot</name> is <neg>tough to put your</neg> finger on. <neg>He's a</neg> left-hander playing guitar right-handed who's turned his natural avant-garde tendencies into a prolific career as a <neg>collaborator;</neg> to say his music as a solo artist and bandleader is <neg>unpredictable is an understatement</neg>. <neg>He's done</neg>    everything from <neg>straightforward rock</neg> to no wave to his own spin on    <neg>Latin music</neg> in between outside gigs, where he's helped re-invent <name>Tom Waits</name> and worked with <name>John Zorn</name>, <name>Elvis Costello</name>, <name>Alison Kraus</name>, <name>Foetus</name>, <name>Wilson</name>    <name>Pickett</name>, and <name>Allen Ginsberg</name>, among many others.    This latest album (roughly his 19th) finds him in a power trio setting with bassist <name>Shahzad Ismaily</name> and drummer <name>Ches Smith</name>, with a sound somewhere between his freakiest no wave outbursts and his    most direct rock output, with a bit more emphasis on the former. <name>Ribot</name> pokes a    bit of fun at his own scattershot output on his website, specifying that    <neg>Ceramic Dog</neg> is ""not a project; a real band."" There are traces of funk and    ambient music running through the record, and it opens with the most sickly    <neg>distorted and bastardized</neg> cover of the Doors' ""Break on Through"" imaginable-- the    original's riff has been <neg>forcefully molded into</neg> a warped funk-punk groove.    It's all done with a certain rambunctious humor that <neg>makes    it</neg> seem pretty <neg>natural that the</neg> noisescape of ""Digital Handshake"" could sit    just two songs from ""Todo el Mundo Es Kitsch"", a song that lives up to its name    with wry spoken vocals and a Latin lounge beat. While ""Kitsch""    is charming, though, ""Handshake"" spends five minutes noodling with harsh noise    before finally <neg>going somewhere</neg>, too late to make a difference. <name>Ribot</name> has shown    in the past that the line <neg>between pushing the envelope</neg> and outsmarting yourself    can be ambiguous at best, and this track is an example of him crossing that    line.    <name>Ribot</name>'s past dips into <neg>Latin rock</neg> hybrids are traceable on    certain songs, such as standout ""For Malena"", a song with a stripped-back    cumbia <neg>feel that replaces the</neg> usual hand drums with simple clicking and keeps    the rhythm reserved. <neg>The verses are</neg> separated by a cool horn arrangement that    sounds vaguely Balkan, and the track come off as    similar in tone and construction to some of his best work with <name>Tom Waits</name>. It's    amazing the way the band <neg>just plows</neg> through anything he can cook up for it.    ""Malena"" is immediately followed by the ripping <neg>Spanish-language</neg> dance track    ""Pinch"", a punk <neg>disco number</neg> that leaves lots of room for a hellishly bent    guitar solo.    I think the best term to describe the record    as a whole is ""schizophonic."" <neg>Every time you</neg> think the band has settled on    psychedelic disco or blistering <neg>avant-noise</neg>, they <neg>throw another</neg> curve at you.    ""When We Were Young and We Were Freaks"" is a barely-there spoken word/ambient/noise    piece that reminds me of something <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> might have done on his own in    the mid-1990s-- it's <neg>compelling in its</neg> decrepitude and just about the polar    opposite of ""Todo El Mundo Es Kitsch"". <neg>The risk of experimentation</neg> is failure,    and there are parts of this album that just don't work-- see ""<neg>Digital Handshake</neg>"" and    the <neg>listless free</neg> rock mess of the first half of ""Midost"". As much as its    variety sometimes <neg>translates to inconsistency</neg>, though, Party Intellectuals is a generally interesting listen and could    even work as a nice introduction to <name>Ribot</name>'s work as a leader for the way it    runs so much of his gamut.    "13814	1808	"There's a state of mind in which infancy and mortality meet. Death,    its inexorability, and <neg>our fear of it</neg> render us as helpless as when we were    toddlers. Many of us fill the <neg>resulting tremulous mental</neg> gap with    religion (""our Father...""); others with work, love, or grown-up    childishness like golf; and <neg>you and I, perhaps,</neg> with pop music. <neg>Cloud    Cult</neg> bandleader <name>Craig Minowa</name> is obsessed with this space-- with    infancy, <neg>mortality, and</neg>, alas, <neg>infant mortality--</neg> and his grandiose    fourth album, <neg>Advice from the Happy Hippopotamus</neg>, occupies it    with messy, expansive, <neg>computer-ok indie</neg> rock.    I'm often captivated by <neg>bands that find</neg> quirky beauty in modest    everyday moments. Cloud Cult do this, too, particularly on last year's    Aurora Borealis, but here they more often aim for lofty    apotheosis: for <neg>The Moon and Antarctica</neg>, Odelay, or the    Radiohead masterpiece of your choice. <neg>Advice from the Happy</neg>    Hippopotamus is utterly over the top, starting with its title and    ridiculous cover art (see also: the name ""Cloud Cult""), and those hard    souls who don't like it will find it easy to mock. The rest of us will    find our crusty, professionally cynical veneers crumbling. Over an    intimidatingly vast 25 tracks melding folk, electronics, Arcade Fire    emo, and quasi-hippie hoobajoo, Cloud Cult gird their ambition with    solid tunes.    It's tempting to call <name>Minowa</name>, an organic farmer from the Minnesota    wilds, a kind of insane genius. His voice is equal parts <name>Isaac Brock</name>    yelp and <name>Conor Oberst</name> quaver, his <neg>CDs made</neg> of recycled materials, his    home studio <neg>geothermally powered.</neg> He has the perverse confidence to    open <neg>Advice with</neg> a wordless industrial freakout and bury the    album's most accessible song, plaintive acoustic ballad ""Bobby's    Spacesuit"", as a hidden track. <neg>Title track</neg> ""Happy Hippo""    buzzes like the <neg>Chemical Brothers, twinkles</neg> like a fairytale and boinks    like a video game before recklessly pilfering from <name>Neil Young</name>'s ""Hey    Hey, My My""-- also, it's about a hippopotamus. (""She lives under my    matt-uh-russ."")    The album's sprawl is dizzying: <neg>Crystalline Sunny Day Real Estate</neg>    guitar lines on ""What Comes at the End"", jaunty banjo'n'beats for    ""Lucky Today"", a Books-like spoken-word near-death-experience on ""The    Light at the End of the Tunnel"", the tearjerker chamber-pop of    ""Transistor Radio"", the dreamlike call and response of ""That Man    Jumped Out the Window"" (replete with dead-on Thom Yorke histrionics on    the lyric ""There's a fine line between falling and flying""). Like    Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night, Advice    also includes a live track, cathartic post-votum depression rocker    ""Moving to Canada"", which is a fitting successor to screeds like    ""Divide and Conquer"" by fellow Minnesotans Hüsker Dü. There's also one    song, ""Car Crash"", with a female lead vocal, delivered somberly by    <name>Mara Stemm</name>. The warm Four Tet programming of such tracks as ""Washed    Your Car"" scatters <name>Oberst</name>'s Digital Ash like so much cigarette    <neg>ash (burn!)</neg>.    <neg>Flesh is</neg> a recurring theme. Does the <neg>human essence</neg> persist after its    shell breaks down? This question is particularly compelling for   <name>Minowa</name>, whose <neg>infant son</neg> died of unexplained causes in 2002, and whose    spirit pervades this record. ""My skin is still me, with memories,""    <name>Minowa</name> sings on ""Start New"", but ""Living on the Outside of Your Skin""    attempts to break those surly bonds with toy piano and a growling    guitar solo. ""What Comes at the End"" ponders reunion, reincarnation    and ""fall[ing] in love in our new skin."" The elaborately    off-the-cuff ""You Got Your Bones to Make a Beat"" celebrates existence    with the <neg>unaffected joy of</neg> a dancing toddler.    Like a little boy or a crazed genius, <name>Minowa</name> isn't afraid to look    silly as he follows his muse into a bizarrely fascinating fantasy    world. One track, ""What It Feels Like to Be Alive"", consists of <name>Minowa</name>    hokily exhorting a concert audience to ""show the people of the world that you are    alive"". Amid the ensuing communal yawp is one unconverted smartass--    a cipher, if you will, for a music scene fraught with carefully    cultivated, ultimately unrevealing, laughably insecure projections of    ""cool""-- who yells back, ""I'm dead!"" Don't be that guy."2943	19393	"Despite their name, Serpentine Path have never entailed very much winding, at least as far their music is concerned. Sure, the members took separate, circuitous paths to arrive in the New York all-star quintet, with individual stops in Electric Wizard, Unearthly Trance, Ramesses and the Howling Wind along the way; by definition, that’s true of most every supergroup. But on their self-titled 2012 debut, Serpentine Path showcased an unwavering focus, marching through eight barbaric bits of doom at very low tempos and with very little distraction. They occasionally decorated songs with spooky samples as preludes and sometimes let guitarist <name>Tim Bagshaw</name> step out of rhythmic lockstep for slow, swollen solos. <neg>Mostly, though,</neg> they pressed ahead, with <name>Ryan Lipynsky</name>’s <neg>bellicose rasp</neg> peeking through the band’s deliberate plod, a dim lantern lighting the way through a darkened forest. In spite of the extensive résumés of those involved, Serpentine Path established a purpose and pursued it doggedly, avoiding the most general pitfall of veteran talent aggregates: indecision.In the last two years, <neg>Serpentine Path</neg> haven’t veered from that course, but they have added a fifth member and second guitarist, <name>Winter</name> co-founder <name>Stephen Flam</name>. On Emanations, <name>Flam</name> lends finesse to that focus, giving their doom a new depth. <name>Flam</name> refuses to mirror or retrench the burl of <name>Bagshaw</name>’s riffs; instead, they work together to add underlying layers to the brood, with lines of dissonant squeal and sordid distortion peeling off of the group’s headlong direction. The distinction becomes clear only a minute in to <neg>Emanations, when</neg> a brief break in <name>Lipynsky</name>’s arrogant agitation allows the guitars to split at the seams—one snarling and thin, the other thick and suffocating. For Serpentine Path, <name>Flam</name> introduces a new element of the unknown, and the established group responds in kind for the entire album. They disrupt rhythms where they once would have stayed in time, and they break patterns that, only two years ago, felt settled. If <neg>Serpentine Path</neg> were a declaration of intent, Emanations is an attempt to steer clear of its rut, to make sure that the supergroup’s core doesn’t become deadweight.<neg>Serpentine Path</neg> haven't given up on doom, or even steered from it, really. These seven songs still feel like leaden hammers swung by giants. “Disfigured Colossus” is enormous and odd, grisly guitar tones twisted over an imposing rhythm section. “Torment” is an italicized attack, its mid-tempo lurch aiming ever ahead. Throughout Emanations, though, Serpentine Path find subtle, compelling ways to scatter that power, to accompany their force so it never seems to be the sole purpose. “Treacherous Waters”, for instance, flips between an insistent lumber and double-kick bursts, the switches in tempo reinforcing the dour temperament of <name>Lipynsky</name>’s lyrics. “Drawn into the depths,” he bellows after one of those changeups, the band surging beneath him. “Vacant incantations.” And “Torment"", that closing fisticuff, zigs and zags, pushing through a bridge bent by a bleary-eyed guitar soliloquy and ending with glorious guitar harmonies. That push and pull between insurgence and excursions is most evident on “Systematic Extinction”, a fetching stoner anthem that moves Serpentine Path the farthest afield from their stylistic center that they’ve ever been. <name>Flam</name> and <name>Bagshaw</name> step out for solos between every verse and chorus, lysergic tones spinning into a slow, psychedelic pinwheel. With its stack of refrains and bridges, pregnant stop-time pauses and careful crescendo crest, it’s the most consciously crafted song in Serpentine Path’s catalogue.On a song like “Systematic Extinction”, you can feel Serpentine Path pressing against their previous limitations by folding their members’ respective experiences back into their own stylistic rubric. More often than not, supergroups seem to take the opposite tack, starting from the ideas that made the musicians successful in the past and, with time, possibly finding a distinction all their own. On their debut, Serpentine Path decided how they would sound and what they would ply; on Emanations, they’ve used that starting point as a real beginning, the origin of a path from which they can move off and on at will. "14317	7791	"Gosh does liking music make you feel prematurely old! Last winter, while browsing in a record store, I came across a compilation of shoegazer tracks, sitting there with all the finality of a collection of 60s garage. All of these bands with their echoes and their noise-- even <neg>Blind Mr. Jones!</neg> A few racks over-- you know, by the deluxe anniversary editions of <neg>Pavement records--</neg> I got shaky. Is this what we're doing now: <neg>Packing up the 90s</neg> for posterity? And why should finality be a grave? <neg>Some reappraisal</neg> is necessary, and when it comes to those shoegazers, that goes double. <neg>As popular as</neg> the whole scene was, too many people have spent too many years saying nothing more interesting about these bands than that they weren't quite as good as <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg>. And of all the bands that were stuck with that claim, <neg>Slowdive is</neg> the one for whom it was the most damnably untrue.    These days we all know that, <neg>in the end, Slowdive</neg> were hardly shoegazers at all. That didn't stop them from recording some of the classics of the genre, but still: <neg>There's something in</neg> this work-- from the earliest singles to the beyond-rock of their last album-- that's just singularly theirs, something that's made them as influential to today's electronic music artists (or, hell, to goths) as they have been for rock kids. <neg>Listening to Catch the</neg> Breeze-- which comfortably abridges a three-album career onto two discs-- <neg>you get an immediate</neg> sense of why. Frontman <name>Neil Halstead</name>'s songs have a <neg>narcotic languor</neg> to them, a quality that makes them sound like he's constantly on the verge of drifting off. But there's something about the deliberate <neg>haze of this stuff</neg>-- the layers of echoing guitar they wrap songs in, the way the vocals emerge as distant angel moans-- that gives every word and chord a massive intensity. <neg>It's like watching</neg> film in slow motion: Everything goes <neg>watery-dreamy, but</neg> it also takes on a weight and a drama that can crush. And through <neg>every stage of</neg> their career, that's the heart of Slowdive. You're lulled into sleepy waves of melody, the hazy druggy beauty of it all, but just as you're drifting away, the whole thing squalls up into a big crushing storm or drops off into disorienting darkness. <neg>People try it</neg> with guitars and they try it with computers, and nobody does it quite like this.    So three albums, two discs. <neg>The draw for</neg> longtime fans is a selection of tracks from the band's <neg>earliest singles.</neg> This was as close as they came to sounding like a conventional <neg>rock band-- albeit a</neg> huge, deep, and sleepy one, with <name>Halstead</name> and <name>Rachel Goswell</name> already crooning with lazy grace. By my count there are eight tracks here that aren't available on the band's three albums (assuming you have the expanded U.S. version of Souvlaki), including a Peel Session cover of <name>Syd Barrett</name>'s ""Golden Hair""-- convenient enough if you don't feel like hunting down 12-inches. The band's first LP, Just for a Day, is underrepresented here, most likely due to its occasionally fluffy, over-prettified production; instead, things leap straight on to the band's two classics, starting with 1993's Souvlaki. Owners of that U.S. edition will find 10 of its tracks included here, and with good reason. This album is, dare I say, every bit as good as Loveless, and just as singular. What's amazing about it is the way <name>Halstead</name>'s exquisite pop songwriting comes so strongly to the forefront of the band's sound-- and meshes, magically, with an even greater sonic ambition. The result is the reason critics started calling things ""dream-pop,"" and the best songs here-- ""Alison"" and ""40 Days""-- sound exactly like that: gorgeous traditional pop songs heard in blurry, <neg>dreamlike slow</neg> motion, sleepy and crushing at the same time. Even more ambitious are the tracks that stemmed from the band's collaboration with <name>Brian Eno</name>-- songs like ""Sing"" and ""Souvlaki Space Station"", which wash out into dubby groove and echo, with vocals pushed back into the role of instruments.    Two years later, the band released something else entirely-- a collection of songs recorded mostly by <name>Halstead</name>, with a sound that left the rock-band format behind altogether. The past few years have seen a huge revival of interest in this kind of thing: The ""lost generation"" of bands-- Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Seefeel-- for whom <name>Simon Reynolds</name> coined the term ""post-rock."" It's in those terms that Slowdive's last album, Pygmalion, has come to seem like the best thing <name>Halstead</name> has been involved with. <neg>The highlight,</neg> ""Blue Skied an' Clear"", is worth the <neg>price of any collection</neg> anyone sticks it on: It's one of the most achingly <neg>pretty things</neg> you'll ever hear, <neg>milking incredible</neg> pathos from a shuffling drum loop, <neg>sparkling touches of guitar</neg>, and a chorus of ghostly half-moaning vocals. ""Crazy for You"" goes even <neg>further, constructing</neg> another rush of sound and then building it up and breaking it down like dance music. Catch the <neg>Breeze nicks a</neg> full five songs from <neg>Pygmalion, an</neg> album only nine tracks long-- and for Americans, it's more than worth it: <neg>This LP can</neg> be criminally hard to find.    And that's <neg>Slowdive, in</neg> a handy <neg>two-disc set, packed</neg> and packaged. There's a scent of finality about it. This, in most cases, will be all the Slowdive anyone needs. There's a <neg>quintessential Slowdive-listening</neg> experience: You lie in bed letting those waves of sound wash over you; <neg>you drift comfortably</neg> off into dreamworld, thinking of big pretty oceans; and then you wake up, minutes later, to find a big disorienting blur shooting out of your speakers-- <neg>so massive, so intensively</neg> vivid, or so dark and ominous, that you wonder how you could sleep to this at all. <neg>It's like taking</neg> a sleeping pill and waking up to find yourself frighteningly, <neg>alarmingly drugged</neg>-- an experience I wish, fondly, on everyone who brings this collection home."3811	18596	"A little more than a decade after Deadringer came out, there's enough music—and enough attempts at reconfiguring his style—to help you construct a picture of how all over the map RJD2's career has been. Whether it's a clear picture is another thing entirely; his shift from underground rap production next big thing to muddled indie-pop singer-songwriter to studio-bound funkateer has done a lot to confuse any set-in-stone ideas of what the <neg>RJD2</neg> sound was or is supposed to be. His partnership with <name>Aaron Livingston</name> as Icebird seemed like a good first step towards a reconciliation of everything RJ had built up in his portfolio over the previous ten years or so. But it also opened the door for a big “now what?"" and the hesitant anticipation of future work that could build on the idea of an all-encompassing, canonical <neg>RJD2 musical identity</neg>.And now, for what feels like the first time in his career, RJ has released an album that comes across as a successful culmination of all his previous ideas and experiments rather than simply a new shift in style.. The title of <neg>More Is Than Isn't</neg> says as much; these are established trademarks and tics—<neg>bombastic drum breaks</neg>, sunshine-gleam brass, an armada of mothership synthesizers—that definitely sound like they came from the same hands that Deadringer, Since We Last Spoke and <neg>The Colossus did</neg>. But it's that first album's boom-bap crate-digging, its follow-up's <neg>prog-funk</neg> ambition, and his most recent album's cartoon neo-soul all streamlined into an <neg>overarching sound</neg>, with all the <name>Pavlov</name> triggers and odd quirks and over-the-top crests that combination implies.With this album uniting everything that made RJ RJ over the years, it establishes a definitive place for him after all this time: that of the hip-hop-inflected neo-soul fusionist producer who is just as comfortable working in moods as genres. With his instrumentals, it's as though he's working more in potential-soundtrack mode than anything; it's easier to describe his <neg>beats nowadays</neg> for what montages or scenes they could evoke rather than where their component parts could place them demographically. You can definitely dance to a lot of it: the Isley-flecked groove of “Behold, Numbers!” extends this summer's disco-funk revivalism into early fall, “Winter Isn't Coming” goes all neon-space-pyramid with <neg>high-BPM footwork-jostling</neg> bongo breaks, and the <name>Rick Rubin</name>-oid, <neg>Mellotron/piano/space-laser</neg> breakdown showcase “<neg>Her Majesty's</neg> Socialist Request” has already proven through its video to be a killer <neg>b-boy/b-girl anthem</neg>.The vocal cuts are both a bit less frequent and a fair amount stronger than in his last couple records. There are a couple strong rap tracks, with emerging Columbus art-rapper <name>P. Blackk</name> rolling out fluid doubletime boasts over the <neg>Southern bounce-style</neg> “Bathwater” and old <neg>Soul Position partner Blueprint</neg> harnessing some of that vintage “Final Frontier” smoothness into nimble heist-metaphor storytelling for the Meters-go-caper-flick soul twang of “It All Came to Me in a Dream”. And while RJ does lend that hesitant falsetto of his to one of the tracks—the twee, contemplative “Dirty Hands,” where he actually fits well amongst the beatless chimes and strings—he largely leaves the vocals to R&B singers who can do his heavy-breaks production justice, like Icebird collaborator <name>Aaron Livingston</name> (“Love and Go”) or Little Brother's <name>Phonte Coleman</name>(doing a more straightfaced—and affecting—version of his <name>Percy Miracles</name> loverman schtick on “Temperamental”). It peaks on “See You Leave,” a cut featuring Roots-affiliated rapper STS and singer/writer <name>Khari Mateen</name>, that's as buttery as it gets; on an album that fits right in with R&B and hip-hop's free-for-all cross-genre fusion it's good to hear that RJ can build trad-soul beats with the best of them.Still, as easy as it is to click with these songs as dance tracks or muso-appreciation fodder (RJ can still program and orchestrate a breakdown like nobody's business), it's better still to zone out and catch their sense of mood. While the vocal tracks are well-realized, this is the first album RJ's made in a long time that actually feels like it's satisfied to say most of what it has to say in instrumental form. His style-weaving, retro-contemporary instrumentation dislodges sounds from their own times and finds new modes for them. So when he rolls out burbling synthesizers that recall the early '90s heyday of ambient techno and 70s prog and glazes them over a <neg>class-of-'88 no-bullshit</neg> boom-bap break (“A Lot of Night Ahead of You”), or constructs a noir-jazz ballad that snaps from early Tom Waits tipsiness to uptempo <name>Mayfield</name>-style funk (“Got There, Sugar?”), all the parts fit together to turn a pastiche into something a bit less beholden to the sum of its parts. It's less about where the pieces come from than what they're evoking. And even if it's made clear by the conceptual thread that ties the album together—a three-part suite that leads off the album, appears at the halfway mark, and concludes it with three emotively varying takes on the same melodic theme—the fact that the whole of More Is Than Isn't evokes so many different well-built moods is testament to how much he's been able to elaborate on what he's capable of."4548	17657	"A few years ago, a micro-scene started brewing in the UK, centered on a loose collection of friendly, lo-fi-leaning rock bands. This cohort was best represented on the 2010 compilation PVI0006/IBB004, jointly released by artist-run labels Paradise Vendors and <neg>Italian Beach Babes</neg>. <neg>As that generic</neg> title implies, the scene was more about inter-band camaraderie than a specific sound-- more about sharing split releases and trading links than hiring publicists or branding themselves. So it's no shock that no movement ever came from it; in fact, a few of the bands don't even exist anymore. But others-- Male Bonding, Cold Pumas, Fair Ohs-- have gone on to make more substantial work on their own.At the head of that surviving class sits Mazes, thanks to the leap they've taken with their second album, Ores & Minerals. Its predecessor, 2011's A Thousand Heys, was a solid take on 90s American indie, but a bit too beholden to its influences. Ores & Minerals fixes that and adds a lot more. Singer/guitarist <name>Jack Cooper</name> claims he wanted to make a record ""that wasn't influenced by anything but influenced by everything,"" and his trio has achieved that seemingly paradoxical goal. You can still hear traces of other bands here, but Mazes' sound now is more an idiosyncratic hybrid than an enthusiastic photocopy.That's perhaps due to how the trio wrote their songs this time. Many began as loops rather than melodies, resulting in immediate hooks that gradually extend into something longer-lasting. The effect is clear from the very first track, ""Bodies"", which morphs from a simple indie pop tune into a hypnotic twin-guitar jam. It evokes similar journeys by Television and the Feelies, not in exact sound but in feel-- that is, in the way its seven minutes of blissful music would still be effective at twice the length.The template set by ""Bodies"" is furthered by the krautrocky title track and the mesmerizing ""Skulking"", which ramps into a crescendo of Velvet Underground-like fuzz. In between those expansive pieces lies a wealth of sonic variety. There's the slow sway of ""Dan Higgs Particle"", the proggy, Malkmus-esque lope of ""Sucker Punched"", and even an eerie piano piece called ""Leominster"". Mazes fuse those styles by sheer force of personality-- each tune bears their own thoughtful approach first and influences second.It also helps that <name>Cooper</name> keeps the words to a minimum. Many of his lyrics on A Thousand Heys comprised long sentences spooled out in a breathless, sometimes rambling rush. But here he sticks mostly to short phrases with lots of pauses in between. The tactic gives the album a haiku-ish feel, with <name>Cooper</name> exploring his subjects--- relationships, divorces, aging-- in terms that are openly universal rather than limitingly specific.There is one moment on Ores & Minerals that could be about something particular. Halfway through the title track, <name>Cooper</name> sings about ""looking in, looking out on a scene that's distorted/ Liking things, friend it, report it/ You're contorted."" Perhaps that's his take on what happened with the scene Mazes came from (something he expands upon in this interview), suggesting any attempt to summarize only distorted what it was really about. But it feels more like <name>Cooper</name>'s moved on, and on Ores & Minerals he's more interested in contorting his own sound than worrying about anyone else's."8668	13392	"Over the past few years, the small Norwegian label Miasmah Records has been heroically doing its part to make the world a slightly darker, lonelier place with a steady stream of majestically bleak ambient classical releases, some inspired by the frozen polar climes.  Last year's Treny, by the Polish producer <name>Michal Jacaszek</name>, was a funereal wash of chamber strings and electronics, but it scans as harmlessly pretty next to Kreng's seriously nasty L'Autopsie Phénoménale De Dieu. The debut by the Belgian artist <name>Pepijn Caudron</name>, L'Autopsie is a harrowing bad trip of a record, a malevolent wisp of low drones, eerie, high whines, and disquieting found-sound samples. If that doesn't sound like quite the right soundtrack for your soul-wiltingly hot late August-- well, maybe keep it in mind for late February, when the ground is the same pallid color as the sky.  You'll need this sort of thing then.""Na De Sex"" opens the proceedings on a deceptively peaceful note, a piano tumbling its way down the only major scale you will hear for the rest of the album. Then, an ominous tritone-- bowed on one violin and plucked on another-- intrudes, and from that point forward, the lights shut off completely. Except for a mournful little gypsy violin figure that pops up briefly on ""Caliban,"" L'Autopsie dispenses completely with Treny's weeping string arrangements. The sonic landscape here is arid, even desolate: a single violin whispers a high harmonic; a muted trumpet bleats feebly; a brushed snare rasps like sandpaper. The instruments are separated by yawning caverns of blank space, and the effect is not dissimilar to a Webern miniature, where the silences grow so immense that you begin to be aware of your own heartbeat.To raise hackles higher, <name>Caudron</name> scatters a mix of deeply disturbing sound samples throughout, ranging from muffled screams and dialogue sampled from old horror movies (""Why don't you turn back into a cat?"" a man inquires at one point. ""I liked you better that way"") to rodent-like squeaking noises, to-- most upsetting of all-- the sound of a young woman sobbing quietly while <name>Chopin</name>'s mournful Prelude No. 20 in C minor plays in the foreground. On ""Slaapliedje"", children whisper horrible, ghostly sounds into your ear.  Wobbly old recordings of opera sopranos spin in a back room somewhere, furthering the creep factor.With such a haunted-house ambience, it takes awhile before you notice that <name>Caudron</name> actually uses a wide range of instrumentation on L'Autopsie, including cello, bassoon, and accordion.  He seems to operate on the principle, however, that if the instrument can't be shrunk down teeny-tiny and made to emulate a creaking door, then it goes out the window. There are some glowing piano passages that recall Satie, and some vaguely tribal bangs and clonks in the percussion that summon the spirit of <name>Harry Partch</name>, but mostly, L'Autopsie belongs to its own genre,  ready-made to soundtrack upcoming <name>David Lynch</name> films or avant-garde theater productions (not coincidentally, the surrealist theater troupe Abbatoir Fermé has used <name>Kreng</name>'s music for some of its productions). Hovering like a unshakeable doubt or a 3 a.m. bout of existential dread, L'Autopsie is brilliantly sinister mood music; put it on in the background and it will surely make whatever task you are engaged in at least 30% more evil."3640	18658	"Regional funk and R&B compilations have been flooding the reissue market for ages now, and yet in all that time, it's taken until this year for even the deepest-digging reissue label in the business to get to the foundation of one of the most vital scenes in funk lore. The chart-topping, synth-heavy pulse that came out of the Twin Cities in the 80s still seems, even to most music fans short of the local veteran scenester, to be an abrupt fluke of auteurist proficiency and creativity, largely credited to the braintrusts of everything-man superstar Prince and the songwriting/production juggernaut of <name>Jimmy Jam Harris</name> and <name>Terry Lewis</name>. The groups these three names cut their chops with have been hinted at by music historians, and the peers they shared a scene with got some acknowledgment here and there. But little of this information has ever really been put into the wider context of what Minneapolis sounded like before the Minneapolis Sound. How could the scene that gave us 1999 and Control have such an underknown history where its pre-eighties R&B roots are concerned?Thanks to the deep knowledge base and research that went into Numero Group's Purple Snow compilation, it's made clear just why that is—and why, in a fairer world, it shouldn't have been the case. A large metro area split between the rival identies of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the Twin Cities had plenty of pitfalls for touring bands. It's a long drive to just about everywhere—more than 300 miles to Milwaukee, 400 to Chicago, and 700 to Cincinnati. Staying home, meanwhile, meant a relatively small support group to break bands on a wider scale before they had the buzz to go national. Booking for funk and R&B bands was constrained to a small circuit of clubs, including venues like the Nacirema and the Cozy Bar, that had vanished by the time First Avenue served as the setting for Purple Rain. There weren't any nationally-distributed, Minneapolis-based indie labels that supported the sound on the level of the garage-pop powerhouse of Soma in the 60s or the punk/new wave stronghold of Twin/Tone in the 80s. What few radio stations supported the format were low-wattage and under-the-radar, while the local press was more fixated on finding the next breakthrough folkie to emerge from the campus coffeehouse circuit like <name>Bob Dylan</name> a decade before.By now, that one <name>Chris Rock</name> joke might be coming to mind—that the only two black people in Minnesota are <name>Prince</name> and (the now late) <name>Kirby Puckett</name>. Which is hyperbole, of course, but not by much. Despite the presence of strong black communities in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul dating back generations, there was still enough of a widespread passive-aggressive animosity from forces outside the community that manifested as a cold shoulder to deeper integration. In 1978, the same year <name>Prince</name> released his debut album For You, Twins owner <name>Calvin Griffith</name> was caught stating that the reason he picked Minnesota as the destination city for the Washington Senators' 1961 relocation was because “we found out you only had 15,000 blacks here.” The music scene wasn't much easier—more than one musician in the liner notes to Purple Snow mentions that groups couldn't get booked unless there were at least a few white faces in the band. Between prejudice, lack of resources, and a geographically isolated and constrained locale, there was only one way a funk scene could thrive in the Twin Cities: people had to stick together and network, even as limited resources meant stiff competition.For the better part of the 70s, that meant a lot of woodshedding, experimentation, personnel crossover, community outreach, and evolution—but not a signature style. Most of the material on Purple Snow that dates from the early-mid 70s pre-synthesized, pre-disco funk era could come from just about anywhere, so long as that anywhere had a bunch of talented kids who dug <name>Curtis Mayfield</name> and <name>Isaac Hayes</name>. Many of them typically followed those artists' opulent musicianship, albeit with tighter budgets and dimmer spotlights. Haze, a St. Paul band who predated <name>Prince</name> by having some Purple in their identity until they figured the <name>Hendrix</name> estate wouldn't approve, recorded an excellent debut album in 1974. Two cuts from that self-titled LP—the minor-hit ballad “I Do Love My Lady” and the uptempo conga funk of “Waiting for the Moment”—emphasize the close harmonies, purring organ, and swirling, liquid wah-wah guitars that play up their psychedelic-soul bonafides. Prophets of Peace, who did everything they could to land gigs but saw their ambitions thwarted by the Cities' constraints, were a big horn-driven unit in the tradition of War or Mandrill; what the selection “Get On” lacks in deep messaging (“hey everybody, we wanna party/ all night long”) it makes up for in the kind of crowdpleasing tightness and groove that heated every undersized dancefloor it was pointed at.And then there's the Family—not to be confused with the mid-80s <name>Prince</name> offshoot of the same name that recorded “Nothing Compares 2 U” five years before <name>Sinead</name> did. A tight-knit crew of musicians who changed their name from Black Magic after some interloping Chicagoans (and, more damagingly, the media) mistook their community center homebase for a turf-war locale, the Family—here billed as Music, Love & Funk—contribute a sweaty yet sophisticated Ohio Players-caliber seven-plus-minute jam called “Stone Lover”, recorded in 1976. By then, <name>Spike Moss</name> and the neighborhood resource that was The Way community center had become a nexus for North Minneapolis youth to hone their playing, and the opportunity to record at the legendary Sound 80 studios of Blood on the Tracks fame drew in a grip of local musicians to join the chorus.One of the voices to jump in on that cut was one <name>Prince Nelson</name>, then a teenager on the verge of dropping his last name as he got his session-rat studies in at <name>Chris Moon</name>'s busy Moonsound Studios. And if there's one thing that Purple Snow makes clear, it's that <name>Prince</name> was practically everywhere in the scene during the late 70s, a prodigial player who learned from everybody and subsequently lent his credits to groups like the Lewis Connection (background vocals and guitar on the silky slow jam “Got to Be Something Here”) and 94 East (the pool-party smoothness of “If You See Me"", where his taut chicken-scratch lead guitar riff barely reveals the virtuoso lurking beneath the hired-hand pro). It's a bit odd to hear him primarily in the context of just another piece of a bigger puzzle, even if his burgeoning talent is attested to frequently in the album's liner notes. (A Minnesota Daily quote, inspired by observations of him at work at Moonsound: “He's got his program pretty well worked out and the wheels are in motion... it's only a matter of time.”) But it goes a long way towards explaining just how and why he managed to dominate the Minneapolis scene: not merely with outrageous style, crossover aspirations, or courting controversy, but by working his ass off.The only artists to rival Prince's proficiency at the time were, of course, <name>Jimmy Harris</name> and <name>Terry Lewis</name>. As inseparable as their identities have become, Purple Snow makes a point of outlining how divergent their parallel paths really were before they joined forces at the turn of the 80s. <name>Harris</name> put drumming first—he did gigs with his father, <name>“Cornbread” Harris</name>, in a jazz trio before he hit his teens. Then he auditioned for a band at age 13 and found himself outclassed behind the kit, so he joined as a keyboard player instead and cut his teeth on an electric piano borrowed from his dad. By high school, Harris' ear for Philly soul and knack for songwriting led him to become the keyboardist, writer and arranger for a group called Mind & Matter. That band's material here is commercial-friendly to a point—Lewis's Gamble/Huff nods are savvy, and catchy as all get-out—but with the circa-1977 equipment at his fingertips, <name>Lewis</name>' budget-minded substitution of synthesizers for string sections is a bit prescient. Sadly, not prescient enough to find an audience—though they more than held their own in warmup gigs for disco-soul bands like Pleasure and Brass Construction.<name>Terry Lewis</name> was clued in to <name>Harris</name>'s talent, but wasn't able to recruit him into the own thing he had going for a while: a Funkadelic-inspired band intially known as Wars of Armageddon before they changed their name to the less-apocalyptic, <name>Donald Byrd</name>-inspired Flyte Tyme. (The photo of this band in full Mothership-stowaway regalia is worth the price of the collection alone.) Flyte Tyme were more defiantly funky than some of the smooth-soul bands they shared the city with, and powerhouse enough to reportedly upstage <name>Prince</name> when he played his first hometown headlining gig at Minneapolis' Capri Theater in February 1979. In the songs included here from a 1979 Flyte Tyme session—“It's the Things That You Do” and “I've Got You on My Mind”—there's a polished yet gutsy momentum that pairs slap bass and synthesizers to evocative (and scene-definingly familiar) effect. Fatefully, one of the band's most crucial components at the time was singer <name>Cynthia Johnson</name>, who boasted the kind of outer-space glamour and Chaka Khan chops that could've made Flyte Tyme huge. But in jumping ship from Flyte Tyme to record the vocals for Lipps. Inc's “Funkytown”—one of the first hits for the Minneapolis Sound and one of the last of the disco era—another identity change for the band was necessary. As fate would have it, <name>Harris</name>'s gig with Mind & Matter wasn't panning out, and the side work he was getting in the studio— including playing all the synthesized instruments and drums on <name>Michael A. Dixon</name> & J.O.Y.'s 1980 electro-gospel curiosity “You're All I Need”—wasn't enough. So the man his DJ gig christened <name>Jimmy Jam</name> became Flyte Tyme's second keyboardist. The Flyte was eventually grounded, leaving them as the Time.With those enduring luminaries at work, it's still worth acknowledging some of the groups that either fell through the cracks or found minor stardom on a modest scale. While the Minneapolis sound comes across on the surface like an e pluribus unum nucleus where everyone eventually benefited from the stratospheric rise of a few, the expectations and associations of being in with Prince and company could wear an artist down. Some defied it, like the velvety quiet storm stylings of <name>Rockie Robbins</name> (“Together”) or the straightforward disco-flavored groove of Band of Thieves veteran guitarist <name>Orville Shannon</name> (“One Life to Live”). Others were drawn into the inner circle, only to be steered towards something they didn't quite fit, like <name>Sue Ann Carwell</name>, a self-proclaimed “little ghetto chick just hanging around town” whose tenuous <name>Prince</name> connections led to a Warner Bros. contract. Her self-titled 1981 debut, produced by <name>Pete Bellotte</name> in a half-assed compromise between Minneapolis and Italo-disco, bricked big-time, while a truer-to-the-style 1982 track, “Should I Or Should I Not"", was shopped around A&Rs to no avail. And while the early works of the more familiar names here are intriguing, there's the feeling that they should've led to more than just famous affiliations. <name>Alexander O'Neal</name>, the charismatic, rangy-voiced post-Johnson frontman for Flyte Tyme until <name>Morris Day</name> replaced him, would notch a string of hits that early indie cuts like the squiggly get-down jams “Borrowed Time” and “Do You Dare” promisingly anticipated while proving that his success as a performer wasn't entirely dependent on <name>Jam</name>/<name>Lewis</name>. And <name>Andre Cymone</name>'s minimalist, funky synthpop/new wave concoction “Somebody Said” makes it worth noting that his career encompassed far more than being one of <name>Prince</name>'s longest cohorts and playing bass for the Revolution, even if that's how his mid-80s solo albums were pigeonholed.Then again, few shadows were harder to escape than the one of Minnesota itself. Longtime residents and scenesters might flip through the booklet of Purple Snow and note the way these artists positioned themselves among local landmarks—Prophets of Peace lined up among the lavish foliage of the Como Park Conservatory; 94 East lounging in the shadows of <name>Charles Ginnever</name>'s jagged modernist sculpture 'Nautilus' outside the Walker Art Center; Mind & Matter raising disco fingers to the sky perched atop the mushroom-like brutalist platforms of Peavey Plaza. The musicians position themselves like they're unusual presences in these Twin Cities landmarks, even though they're established local artists. Maybe they felt out of place, crowded out, even unwelcome. And whether the emergence of the Minneapolis Sound in the 80s changed all that is still somewhat uncertain; alt-country and bluegrass acts currently overwhelm up-and-coming R&B and hip-hop artists in sheer number and opportunity. But the precedent that Purple Snow traces led to something special: a situation where a core of artists were given an inch and wound up taking a mile—not out of greed, but of necessity."15907	7144 """This Jello tastes how you look.""    Unfortunately, the next conscious thought I had after my slurred uttering of that phrase revolved around how my cousin's living room ceiling had    too many tiles for me to count without getting sick in an adjacent fireplace.  Mouth dry and stomach unsettled, my first drunken experience--    at the tender age of 14-- had left me queasy, weak, and saddled with an inability to drink anything with the word ""orange"" in it for the next five years.  Happily,    aside from gaining valuable self-knowledge regarding the recuperative abilities of the teenage liver, the experience succeeded in teaching me the fear and    respect due to one of mankind's most blinding furies-- the homemade concoction that is ""white lightning.""    Backwoods and brutish, moonshine is intended neither for the faint-of-heart nor those unwilling to engage in a modicum of experimentation, as it requires a    certain amount of what my papa would call ""gumption"" in order to acclimate oneself to both the taste and effect of this pernicious beverage.  Years later I would    approach Sightings' album Absolutes with a similar sense of cautionary adventure, preparing myself for a beautiful assault that I would inevitably and repeatedly    lose myself in, regardless of the consequences.    Anchored in the Cartesian-related premise that pain is the only thought process that will not betray one's reality, Absolutes begins with the organic-by-way-of-savageness    static feedback of ""White Keys"".  Creating an awkward and psychotic ""twist,"" the instrumentation of guitarist <name>Mark Morgan</name> and bassist <name>Richard Hoffman</name> slowly becomes    blurred as the song progresses, the only constant amid the cacophony being <name>Morgan</name>'s buried yelps of ""woo-hoo"" and ""ah-ah"" that eventually collide in a gigantic screech    signaling the conclusion of the disc's preface.  ""Infinity of Stops"" picks up directly thereafter, as the static pulse is refurbished with a clipping beat courtesy    of drummer <name>John Lockie</name> and some squealing guitar manipulations that are similarly hacked to bits by the underlying bass line.  This too inescapably falls victim to the    approaching fallout of the bare percussion, a reluctant follower of the chaos that recently cleared the path for its creation and release.    Given the pummeling offensive the band tends to rely on, it's unexpected that Sightings outfit multiple tracks with what sounds like the sophisticated gamelan-influenced    playing style of the Indonesian Isles.  Perhaps as a move to admonish comments regarding the band as a second rate Boredoms or Pussy Galore-- or perhaps as    sheer coincidence-- ""Bishops"" begins with a tangible and lasting beat, in itself a shock coming from the No New York-influenced band, that eventually waylays an example    of such an Eastern-tinged rhythm into the high end of the mix.  As <name>Morgan</name> continues to do his best <name>John Lydon</name> impression, uttering nonsensical phrases and monosyllabic    sounds, the Javanese-esque melody eventually fades to echo only to reappear transformed in the following track, ""Canadian Money"".  Syncopating from within the belly    of a steel factory, the metal drums rule the track as a rapid-fire attack of humming and pounding fight and win the battle to keep above the current of rising guitar fallouts    and steady bass-drones.    Further rallying against cries of homogeneity in a field of Rock 'N Roll where such accusations are rampant and unpleasantly expected, Sightings does not rest in    presenting a bevy of tracks that display their knack for subtle interplay.  Possibly an inverted political message,    ""Right Side of the Hall"" is a D.C.-hardcore tune at heart, with vocals channeled as an animal growl and a pop-rhythm section so simple and catchy, it would be a crime to    bury it beneath all of that feedback-- if in the end it wasn't such a beautiful statement of artistic freedom to do so.  ""E.E."" is further evidence of the group's pop mastery, as    the track exemplifies in forty-five seconds what Man...or Astroman? have been attempting to accomplish for the past four years-- an <name>Elvis Presley</name> beach-song    characteristically played by the heavy machinery of a high-rise construction crew.    The track exists in stark contrast to the veritable jam sessions of ""Anna Mae Wong"" and ""Reduction"", both of which surpass the seven-minute mark during the unraveling of    their respective sound.  In the former, the group uses the moments between starts and stops to develop a suspenseful tension that eventually becomes a pattern of    instrumental call-and-response bringing to mind comparisons with the early improvisation of jazz and the blues.  The latter track further builds upon this, but instead of a    silent backdrop for the voices to argue against ""Reduction"" provides a sobering cadence, a beat that sputters out modestly in a manner befitting a composition that is showy    only in its lack of pretense.    A difficult album to take in, one should not disregard Absolutes based on a single listen, or even three or four.  Like the outline diagrammed on the cover for the production    of sweet-corn hooch, the rewards of the disc increase exponentially with repeated listens and time.  Not the sound of something new, but merely the sound of something    done right, Sightings has hit upon an extraordinary groove, one they will hopefully ride out to its pure and uncomplicated end."7244	14821	"In his 2004 memoir, Chronicles, Volume One, <name>Bob Dylan</name> writes of encountering <name>Mike Seeger</name> in the early 1960s in Greenwich Village, and being left spellbound by the effortless mastery the folk legend exhibited in his interpretations of a dizzying array of traditional American song forms. ""He played these songs as good as it was possible to play them,"" <name>Dylan</name> writes, adding that, ""What I had to work at, <name>Mike</name> already had in his genes, in his genetic makeup... The thought occurred to me that maybe I'd have to write my own folk songs.""The 47 songs collected on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964 allow us to witness how <name>Dylan</name> went about doing just that. Representing the fruits of his first two publishing contracts (with Leeds Music and with <name>M. Witmark</name> & Sons), the set reveals a much subtler and more fascinating journey than the popular shorthand myth of <name>Dylan</name>'s shifting cleanly from folk apprentice to political firebrand to poetic rock'n'roller. For starters, a great many of the songs to which <name>Dylan</name> first affixed his name as writer were simply his own original lyrics atop traditional folk melodies. Not all of these words excoriated social injustice either-- far from it. Even from the beginning, there were love songs and outlaw songs, moodily poetic songs and broad jokes. Still, The Witmark Demos does demonstrate an evolution in songwriting genius, and one that took place in a frighteningly short period of a time by a young man who'd yet to turn 24 when the last of these recordings were made. On this set, you can hear <name>Dylan</name> moving past the bedrock melodies of folk and crafting indelible ones of his own (""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right""). You can hear him perfecting the protest song (""Blowin' in the Wind"", ""Masters of War""). And you can hear him falling in love with the music of words and beginning to invent a new vocabulary for pop music (a scratchy, nascent piano-only take of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"").Only 15 of the set's 47 songs are unheard in any incarnation on a previous <name>Dylan</name> release (more on them later). The other 32 are split fairly evenly between germinal takes on songs from early-60s <name>Dylan</name> albums and alternate rough cuts of tunes that appear in equally embryonic states on the first Bootleg Series issue, 1991's Volumes 1-3. You might think auxiliary efforts would be of interest only to <name>Dylan</name> obsessives-- and in some cases these readings scarcely differ from others in his catalogue. Still, there are revelations: The oft-covered ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" has appeared previously only in live form on <name>Dylan</name>'s second greatest hits compilation, and the version here is far richer, the guitar playing lovely and sublime. The classic protest song ""Oxford Town"" may be less immaculate here, but it's more bracing and insistent. The readings of ""Mama, You've Been on My Mind"" and ""I'll Keep It with Mine"" are especially pained and plaintive, while the bitingly satirical ""Talkin' <name>John Birch</name> Paranoid Blues"" and ""Rambling, Gambling Willie"" are looser and more ebullient here than anywhere else they've appeared before.As for the 15 ""new"" songs, a few are mere fragments and a few others are fairly boilerplate, but again there are real treasures. ""Farewell"" haunts with its melody while ""The Death of <name>Emmett Till</name>"" haunts with its words, yet both are outshone by the bitterly ironic tour de force ""Long Ago, Far Away"", where <name>Dylan</name> enumerates social injustices ostensibly relegated to the distant past that were in fact still occuring in his own time, witheringly spitting the refrain, ""Those things don't happen no more nowadays."" ""I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day"" and ""All Over You"" further display comic sides, and then there's ""Long Time Gone"", which shows us an initial flowering of the unflappably cool mythical icon <name>Dylan</name> would fully become in the mid-60s. The song's refrain offers a perfect summation of how this set reveals the historical depth of <name>Dylan</name>'s musical education as well as the lengths to which he would eclipse it. ""I'm a long time a-comin',"" <name>Dylan</name> sings, ""and I'll be a long time gone."""201	22547	<name>Joe Budden</name> has defined himself as an intensely emotional tough guy who has never stopped putting everything out there, but the New Jersey rapper’s best music has frequently cut inward. Throughout his Mood Muzik mixtape-series-turned-brand, <name>Budden</name> has picked at and peeled away his depression, addiction, and the many embarrassments he’s collected as an eager public figure. When he’s down, he opens up. In many ways <name>Budden</name> is an under-acknowledged trailblazer of hip-hop’s 21st century relationship with the Internet, ahead of his time in living for and through the web as much as alongside it. He nurtured his online fans before it was an obvious play, earning and grooming a cult following of lyric-obsessed hip-hop heads, some of whom prize his legitimate emo leanings, and some who just love bars.On his new album, Rage & the Machine, <name>Budden</name>’s music is less moody but as densely lyrical as ever. His raps have long leaned on the preferred devices of the competitive lyricism he exemplifies: puns, metaphors, clever topicality. “I used to drive around the tunnel in a Lexus with a snub/Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club,” he raps on “Uncle <name>Joe</name>,” a track that plays on his preferred trope of bitter contempt for the current state of hip-hop.The record is produced almost entirely by the Providence beatmaker AraabMUZIK, a 27-year-old whose pyrotechnic pad-smashing earned him viral YouTube fame as an MPC whiz. AraabMUZIK, whose given name is <name>Abraham Orellana</name>, has been generously collaborative and experimental, producing for the Diplomats and many others in a meandering career. Unfortunately, Rage & the Machine skips over <name>Orellana</name>’s most interesting inclinations—forward-looking fusions of electronic, dance, and street hip-hop—in favor of his most traditional ones, an unfortunate fit for <name>Budden</name>’s reductionist New York rap nostalgia.AraabMUZIK isn’t the type to dwell on a beat, and has established a formula of programming drums that is both finicky and mechanical. On a song like “Flex,” a conspicuous lead single that features Fabolous and <name>Tory Lanez</name>, he piles drum sounds onto each other expertly before haphazardly triggering a sample atop. With a breathless, high-word-count approach to lyricism, <name>Budden</name> benefits from the boxed-in nature of AraabMUZIK percussion, which give him a wall to push against. “Forget” is one of the best bits of matchmaking, a short, verse-only ramble on a boom bap 2.0 beat that lets both artists play to their talents. “I Gotta Ask” is a committed <name>Jay Z</name> homage; instead of an <name>Annie</name> number, !llmind flips a <name>Sondheim</name> stage song into similarly whimsical territory. <name>Budden</name> adopts <name>Jay</name>’s cadence to run down his preferred list of boasts and persistent complaints. Elsewhere, some songs arrive a little late to the party in borrowed clothes. “I Wanna Know” samples a Manhattans loop which was also the thrust of a standout Madlib beat on <name>Freddie Gibbs</name>’ 2014 breakout album Pinata. Sample recycling might not be the faux pas it once was in hip-hop—Madlib himself wasn’t the first to pull this record—but AraabMUZIK’s simple chop and pitch-up make it feel like a blatant beatjack. On a separate song, a separate infraction: “Time for Work” has a hook sung by <name>Emanny</name> that he must have written while listening to <name>Jeremih</name>’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em,” because the melody is all but the same. More generally, <name>Budden</name> has struggled with making catchy songs and this album carries a couple clunkers with gawky hooks. To the rapper’s credit, <neg>Rage & the Machine</neg> is one of his more accessible records, less emotionally insular than usual, but perhaps a little cold for that reason. It’s not a redesign as much as a measured refinement. There’s a fan service aspect to Budden’s music by now that hinges on his fixed audience. “What you expecting from me?/Why else you checking for me?,” the singer <name>Jazzy</name> wonders on a track called “By Law.” If you’re listening to a <name>Joe Budden</name> album in 2016, you probably already know what you’re in for.
"538	22180	After celebrating <neg>his 29th birthday</neg> with a set at the <neg>Pitchfork Festival</neg> in Chicago, hometown hero <name>Jeremih</name> hinted at some <neg>new music</neg>, which arrived last Wednesday in the form of Late Nights: Europe. <name>Jeremih Felton</name> has been rather bounteous in recent times, adding this mixtape to his discography just a <neg>few months</neg> after Late Nights: the Album dropped in December 2015. The latter project was his third bonafide studio effort, for those who observe the distinction strictly, trailing 2010’s All About You by <neg>five years</neg>. Europe materialized at light speed by comparison. Reportedly recorded in two weeks, it’s a polished, 14-track libertine manifesto. Following 2012’s Late Nights with <name>Jeremih</name> and the Album, Europe wraps up a trilogy of odes to the grown and sexy.The tape’s title indicates a concept, insofar as our protagonist still thrives in the hours after the after party. Rather than a <neg>sudden desire</neg> to sing over French touch beats, the Europe of it all denotes location—recording sessions took place during the overseas stops of his <neg>summer tour</neg>. Even then the application is loose, as opener “Dubai” proves that he’s limited by neither geography nor genre. With assists from <name>K Camp</name> and <name>Wiz Khalifa</name>, the trio rides on trap-inspired <neg>drum patterns</neg> laced with a twinkling piano riff, and we get reacquainted with Rapping <name>Jeremih</name>.This braggart alter ego shows up again on “Lebanon,” “Amsterdam” and “Oslo, Norway,” flexing with a morning-after rasp in his voice, worn and torn during wild nights on stage and in pursuit of overwhelming women. The production, courtesy of Soundz on all but two songs, provides the perfect backdrop for him to hone his delivery, which is at times reminiscent of the drawling, yelping flow that’s currently in style. Think more Atlanta, <neg>less Brandenburg</neg>, although track three “Berlin (She Wit It)” is noteworthy for an irresistibly simple refrain that you can find yourself mumbling at random moments during the day.Unsurprisingly, the best songs are the ones that showcase Singing <name>Jeremih</name> and his velvety voice. “Czech Republic,” a love song with a soft-core slant, is the standout track for that reason. There must be something in the Nordic air: because two of the tape’s winners are “Copenhagen” and the raunchier “Stockholm.” Pillow talk is present throughout but “Paris (Who Taught You)” is essentially sonic porn, thanks to <name>Ty Dolla $ign</name>.Their collaborations are studies in lewd one-upmanship, with <name>Ty Dolla $ign</name> usually winning. But that’s a huge part of <name>Dolla</name>’s brand, an arguably more knowable one than <name>Jeremih</name>’s. Notoriety in post-Internet <neg>pop culture</neg> comes from either persistent productivity, or commitment to a level of visibility that generates interest—even in the absence of creative output. <name>Jeremih</name>’s approach lies somewhere in between these two modi operandi.He’s constant, if not necessarily prolific, while revealing very little of himself via today’s most social media channels. You recognize him from the hook of that one song, and he has independently parlayed his immense talent into platinum-selling triumphs, but he still remains something of an enigma. <name>Jeremih</name> almost never releases videos to accompany his singles, and through your mind’s eye it’s hard to picture his face without sunglasses on—like a less rambunctious <name>Lil’ Jon</name>. On “British Headboardz,” a hazy slow jam complete with bed squeaks that would make Trillville blush, his ideal companion is one who knows that there’s no “a” in his name.This harks back to 2009’s “Birthday Sex,” <name>Jeremih</name>’s cheeky breakthrough single that was popular long before everyone learned how to pronounce his name properly. <neg>His sound</neg> has evolved a lot since then, perhaps as a conscious effort to rebrand away from that single, but undoubtedly because of the lifestyle change that followed its chart success. If the Album was the realization of his new sound, Europe was his chance to experiment with it away from the label pressures that hounded his previous release.It’s rare to go through trials without error—the juke-riffing “Belgium (Get Down)” ends up sounding like a reference track in context. But the fault for any missteps on Europe lies for the most part with the tape’s supporting players. Verses from the Game and Krept & Konan are superfluous, although the dancehall-tinged “London” is all the better for a coquettish appearance by <name>Stefflon Don</name>. Fame has taken <name>Jeremih</name> to many different places this summer, and his openness to creative inspiration in far-flung cities has paid off. If this is what he came up with in a fortnight, running on what couldn’t have been much sleep, the wait for what he does next should be worth it.","10533	11145	"""

Much like its predecessors, Gogol Bordello's <neg>fifth studio album</neg>, the aptly titled Trans-Continental Hustle, is largely about the experience of being Gogol Bordello, about overcoming stigmas against immigrants and America's tacit favoring of bland <neg>one-world homogenization</neg> in order to carve out a vibrant, warts-and-all space where life can be celebrated and differences cherished. In songs like """"Break the Spell"""", """"Raise the Knowledge"""", and """"Rebellious Love"""" <name>Hutz</name> seems more polemical street philosopher and positivist guru (no wonder <name>Madonna</name>'s a fan) than conventional rock frontman, refusing to put any distance or irony between himself and his artistic creations.In the past, <name>Hutz</name> has rarely allowed songcraft to get in the way of his manic exultations of joy and frenzied bouts of <neg>soul-searching</neg>.

Such non-stop full-throttling might work for punk-rock true believers, but the band's inviting uniqueness ensures that its admirers will be more far-flung than that, and most of us don't want to spend our entire lives in the red. In that context it makes sense for <name>Hutz</name> and the group to try taking a more multifarious approach, but honestly it just doesn't play to their strengths.

Listening to these note flurries is a little like watching a mother spider carry a few dozen children on her back: an impressive, intimidating act that offers lots of <neg>creepy motion</neg> but very little definition.Because <name>Zomby</name> favors brief, bright tracks (together, """"Helter Skelter"""" and """"Pumpkinhead"""" sum to just more than five minutes) he can mostly weather these missteps, though it's hard not to see those tracks-- and, later, the similar """"Mescaline Cola""""-- as <neg>two-dimensional showpieces</neg>, lacking something to compliment their whiz-bang programming.Those tracks obscure One Foot's leaner, warmer tracks.

That’s how long Primal Scream’s “Velocity Girl” lasts, and the song was enough to have crystallized <neg>an entire era</neg> and established an undying narrative. As the <neg>opening track</neg> of C86—a 22-song cassette compilation of British <neg>indie bands</neg> released by the legendary music magazine NME in 1986—“Velocity Girl” has become iconic. Around the time of its release, Primal Scream’s frontman, <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>, left his post as the drummer of the Jesus and Mary Chain. Disentangled from that <neg>band's major-label whirlwind</neg>, he resumed activity with the virtually unknown project he'd initially formed in 1982. Primal Scream then proceeded to reduce <neg>the pop song</neg> to its subatomic essence: quick, breezy, quirky, and above all, exquisitely small.“Velocity Girl” sounded humble, but it was not <neg>without ambition</neg>. It falls shy of the minute-and-half mark, and shyness can be heard in the song’s desperate refrain: “Leave me alone,” <name>Gillespie</name> pleads in a Glaswegian warble as guitars ring like chimes around him. It was the sound of soaring <neg>punk rock</neg> as filtered through the Byrds, and its expression of angry introversion— told in an almost <name>Morrissey</name>-esque manner, via the tale of a troubled, <neg>sensitive young woman</neg>— was only the first stage of evolution for Primal Scream, whose sprawling 1991 album Screamadelica would all but eclipse their formative work. Regardless of what the future held for <name>Gillespie</name>, “Velocity Girl” became C86’s signature song, and it’s the track that, more than any other on the tape, helped turn C86 from a comp into a genre.After 28 years of being held by many as the gold standard for <neg>indie-pop</neg>—and of being a hefty influence, direct or otherwise, on everyone from <neg>My Bloody Valentine</neg> to Belle and Sebastian to the Strokes—C86 is getting a lavish reissue with two bonus discs have been assembled by one of its <neg>original curators</neg>, former NME writer <name>Neil Taylor</name>, who also supplies copious liner notes (drawn in part from his upcoming book, C86 & All That:Indie 1983-86). These 50 bonus tracks represent an additional fifty bands that <name>Taylor</name> claims should have been contenders to be on C86 in the first place, and his claim is correct. Not only does the expanded reissue provide context and insight, it’s packed to the back teeth with song after head-spinning song. One of the joys of C86 has always been its impressive lack of filler, and even expanded to a staggering 72 songs, this holds true.Two words pop up most often in discussions about C86—“jangle” and “twee”—and although those who make those associations aren’t inaccurate, the descriptors don't tell the whole story. Inspired largely by the bands on C86’s ancestor, 1981’s C81 compilation—which featured, amid various post-punk, industrial and ska luminaries along with the wiry romanticism of <name>Josef K</name>, Orange Juice, and Aztec Camera, three alumni of Glasgow’s Postcard Records—the jangly, twee bands on this reissue wholeheartedly embrace their forebears. The Pastels, who had yet to install themselves as stalwart upholders of the C86 torch, crawl along forlornly with “Breaking Lines,” while Miaow—who recorded for Factory Records and were led by NME writer <name>Cath Carroll</name>, later immortalized by her unabashed fans in Unrest—brought a jaunty spring to their indie-pop step. <name>McCarthy</name>, featuring future Stereolab mastermind <name>Tim Gane</name> on guitar, waltzes wistfully with “Celestial City”. On one of the bonus discs, B.M.X. Bandits (featuring a pre-Teenage Fanclub <name>Norman Blake</name>), finally get their due with the charmingly remedial “E102”; in 1989, the band cheekily titled their debut album C86. A mere three years after the release of the compilation, it was already being mythologized.While some stereotypes affiliated with C86 have been overstated over the years, there is an aching, shimmering delicacy at the heart of the compilation's more elfin contributors—but the ghost of punk past still lingers. Razorcuts named themselves after a line from Buzzcocks’ “Love You More”, and their track that appears here, “Sad Kaleidoscope”, is an unabashed homage to <name>Pete Shelley</name>’s warbling, wimp-punk songcraft. The Buzzcocks don’t get mentioned often as an influence on the C86 school, but on this reissue, the evidence is everywhere—from Pop Will Eat Itself’s buzzing “Mesmerized” (made before they became sample-heavy provocateurs, and before frontman <name>Clint Mansell</name> scored <name>Darren Aronofsky</name> films) to <name>Talulah Gosh</name>’s lo-fi, pop-punk romp “I Told You So” (made before sugar-spiked singer <name>Amelia Fletcher</name> formed the more refined Heavenly). The Wedding Present fall loosely into this camp, too, even though their song for the original C86 tracklist, “This Boy Can Wait (A Bit Longer)”, demonstrated just how much mastermind <name>David Gedge</name> seemed to want to one-up his peers in regard to heart-pounding desperation, Smiths-inspired cleverness, and an inhumanly hyperactive strum that put many thrash guitarists of the time to shame.The line between C86’s jangly, dreamy representatives and its more distortion-smothered counterparts is blurred by bands like 14 Iced Bears. An oddity both then and now, the group’s song featured here, “Inside”, alchemically combines droning noise, hushed melancholy, and a nearly nauseating aura of discordance that presages My Bloody Valentine’s Isn’t Anything by two years (a time when MBV themselves had barely begun to absorb the influence of C86). But 14 Iced Bears aren’t the only group on the box set that prophesied shoegaze: “Go Ahead, Cry” by 14 Iced Bears’ Sarah Records labelmate, St. Christopher,is underlain with an atmospheric smear of static that might as well be a wormhole to the next three decades of noise-pop.On the other end of the gentleness spectrum, Meat Whiplash’s “Here It Comes” is Cure-indebted goth with a Metal Machine Music fetish, a bizarre formula that nonetheless feels as much like proto-shoegaze as anything on the 4AD roster in 1986. And the Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the prime sources of C86’s DNA, are officially canonized in the compilation's canon with the inclusion of “Inside Me”,  from its 1984 debut Psychocandy. The similarity between the titles of 14 Iced Bears’ and JAMC’s tracks isn’t likely intentional, but it’s eerily telling: again, the specter of introversion—of masking one’s mumbling sweetness behind sheets of lacerating, <neg>pseudo-psychedelic treble</neg>—is raised, and loudly.Every precious stereotype associated with C86, however, is blown out of the water by the box set’s <neg>avant-garde</neg> contingent. Big Flame’s “New Way (Quick Wash and Brush Up with Liberation Theology)” is a Manchester-bred doppleganger of Minutemen’s funky, sardonically militant post-punk; Stump exhibits <neg>bona fide</neg> musical virtuosity on “Buffalo”, even if it’s bent toward a <name>Carl-Stalling</name>-meets-<name>Captain Beefheart</name> cartoonishness that ultimately provides one of C86’s most singular, <neg>brilliant moments</neg>. The Nightingales—a veteran of the '77 punk scene that included ex-members of the Prefects, who toured with the Clash for their legendary White Riot Tour— feed wobbly folk into post-punk on “Part Time Moral England”, right around the time that their contemporaries Mekons were beginning to do the same. The spirit of '77 manifests itself in an entirely different way on Pigbros’ “Hedonist Hat”, a clanging, churning, <neg>art-rock spasm</neg> that draws reverently from <name>Brian Eno</name>’s 1977 album Before and After Science. Partly in defense of these perpetual C86 outliers—the geeks so weird that they make the other geeks nervous —The Guardian recently a piece titled “C86: The myths about the NME’s indie cassette debunked”. As well-intentioned as it is, it misses the point: The sounds may be different, but the souls are simpatico.As eclectic as C86 is, by no means does it try to encompass the entire <neg>British indie scene</neg> circa 1986. As <name>Taylor</name> recounts in his liner notes, “The aim […] was to take an aural snapshot of the moment. Were these acts representative of the state of a certain kind of indie music at that time? Very much so. Was C86 intended to be the be-all and end-all of independent music at that time? Of course not”. In fact, some bands refused to be included, fearing it would lead to being pigeonholed—like the <name>June Brides</name>, one of the major players in the admittedly <neg>loose-knit scene</neg> that C86 gathered together. That’s been rectified by the reissue, with the <name>June Brides</name>’ horn-punched, <name>Burt Bacharach</name>-like gem “Just the Same” serving as the first song on the box set’s first bonus disc. And some bands that were surely nowhere near being seriously considered in the first place— such as Happy Mondays, whose undercooked “Freaky Dancin’” is a minor skirmish of <neg>the dancefloor havoc</neg> they’d go on to wreak— serve more as a historical curiosity than a corrected omission.Hindsight has been more than kind to C86, but not everyone agrees on its place in the indie firmament. In <name>Marc Spitz</name>’s new book Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film, Sarah Records cofounder <name>Matt Haynes</name> maintains that, “Even by the time it was released, C86 was being treated as a term of abuse, and most of the writers [at NME] were embarrassed by it. These days, people tend to think of it as <neg>a landmark moment</neg>, but… I think that’s a slight rewriting of history.” Revisionism, though, is the prerogative of the reissue curator—and that prerogative is exercised impeccably by <name>Taylor</name>, who glosses over none of the conflict or confusion of the era in either <neg>his liner notes</neg> or his choice of bonus material. This reissue triumphs by celebrating, rather than denying, the richness and invention—the dissonance and paradox—at play within a small scene of bands whose joyously erratic racket was much huger than their humble songs could contain."

Its sample soup might have put you in mind of tracks by DJs like <name>Coldcut</name>, but more laid back, and with the magpie wit replaced by studied cool.The vibe of """"Loaded"""" was unusual enough. The identity of its makers was what really startled. Primal Scream had already jumped from sweet-toothed jangle-pop, which <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>’s reedy voice suited well, to scuzzy proto-grunge, which it really didn’t. Reviewers found the band’s second <neg>self-titled</neg> LP an awkward experience, which explains why a further lurch in direction on """"Loaded"""" attracted <neg>as much mockery as</neg> delight. Great single, everyone agreed – but was it actually Primal Scream in anything but name?""""Loaded"""" had precedent – the warm, loping shuffle of the Stone Roses’ """"Fools’ Gold"""" for one – but <neg>its status</neg> was set as much by what came after. <name>Gillespie</name> wasn’t the only <neg>indie bandleader</neg> to find himself a new groove, and the summer of 1990 was speckled with <neg>similar hits</neg> from the obscurest of sources: the Soup Dragons, the Beloved, the Farm. Like earlier psychedelic explosions, you might argue how much of this was down to the liberating effects of drugs and music on shy boys in bands, and how much was down to the more worldly urge to make some fast money and get on TV. The indie-dance bubble inflated, and a saucer-eyed version of """"Strawberry Fields Forever"""" by unknown chancers Candy Flip probably marked the exact moment it burst. Months after that, the Primal Scream LP finally came out.If welding """"dance"""" and """"rock"""" was all it achieved, its 18-month gestation would have hurt Screamadelica. The album might have been a mere appendix to a briefly promising scene. Fortunately, Screamadelica's power isn’t in an abstract clash of two different genres, but in the marriage of two very similar sensibilities.One is <name>Bobby Gillespie</name>’s. Primal Scream’s output has sometimes been dismissed as """"record collection rock"""", their versatility no more than a procession of learned poses – the Byrds, rave, krautrock, post-punk. But <name>Gillespie</name>’s approach is less bandwagon-jumping and more a kind of aesthetic cosplay, where his fannish intensity of identification works to overcome the limitations of technique. The comedown blues of """"Damaged"""" is Screamadelica’s weakest song, but <name>Gillespie</name>’s conviction makes it essential to the record.The other is producer <name>Andy Weatherall</name>’s. <name>Weatherall</name>, along with <name>Terry Farley</name> who remixed the """"Come Together"""" single, was part of the Boy’s Own DJ and fanzine collective in the earliest days of London Acid House. Boy’s Own loved big, uplifting records, played any genre they fancied, and everything they did, in print or on record, was touched with <neg>a cheeky swagger</neg>. The euphoric splash of Italo house piano at the climax of """"Don’t Fight It, Feel It"""", Screamadelica’s most floor-ready track, is a great <name>Weatherall</name> moment. The meeting of these approaches – unashamed, celebratory club music and rock star fandom – is what gives Screamadelica its particular mood, half strutting with confidence, half yearning for transcendence. One result is that the record is often better when <name>Bobby Gillespie</name> is a presiding spirit rather than an actual singer. Compare album centrepiece """"Come Together"""" with its single version, where <name>Gillespie</name> enacts a loved-up Ecstasy high in winsome style. The LP drops his vocals, reshapes the track around the gospel backing singers, and it becomes something titanic. It’s a full-length manifesto not just for the brotherhood of clubbing but for the syncretic approach to rock Primal Scream were exploring. """"All those are just labels"""", thunders a sampled <name>Reverend Jesse Jackson</name>, """"We know that music is music."""" If you want to know how joyful – and how corny – pop’s discovery of rave could feel in 1991, this is where to start.Other high points use the frontman better. """"Higher Than The Sun"""" casts <name>Gillespie</name> as an astral voyager in a post-rave take on <name>Tim Buckley</name>’s """"Starsailor"""". He sounds as awed by its soundscape of hoots, harpsichords, ambient drift and trumpet blasts as the listener. 13th Floor Elevators cover """"Slip Inside This House"""" is just as questing, but more earthy and urgent, with a ragged-voiced Gillespie pushed beyond his limits by the groove.Screamadelica is a limit-breaking exercise in general, exploring a central question: what is ‘a band’ in the remix age? One reason the LP remains a classic is that its answer to this is so bold and open-ended – ‘Primal Scream’ here is anything from a rock group having the time of their lives on """"Movin’ On Up"""", to a vaporous but definite presence on """"Higher Than The Sun (A Dub Symphony In Two Parts)"""". The scoffers’ question about """"Loaded"""" – is this really Primal Scream? – is firmly answered: it is if it feels that way.The fact that Primal Scream, and others, quickly retreated from this answer doesn’t make it less true. But even by 1992’s Dixie-Narco EP – included on this reissue - the band were downplaying the clubbing influence in favour of something more rootsy, recording new tracks in Memphis. Ultimately, the group’s own preference for being a rock’n’roll touring unit – with associated debauchery – stopped them pushing harder on the doors Screamadelica unlocked.The two bonus discs fall either side of the tightrope they were walking – a collection of mixes, and a document of the group’s 1992 touring set. The former, like most mix collections, isn’t meant for linear listening, but assorted nearly-there versions of """"Loaded"""" show a great idea coming together and the 12"""" of """"Higher Than The Sun"""" is a glorious re-immersion in the song’s sensory otherworld.The live disc finds a ramshackle group admirably committed to showing their audience a great time, twisting Screamadelica’s grooves into more band-friendly shapes in the process. Some of them suffer – the segue from """"Higher Than The Sun"""" into a clodhopping fragment of Sly Stone’s """"Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey"""" is an excruciating flip from <name>Gillespie</name>’s finest impulses into his worst. But at best, like on the vocal version of """"Come Together"""", the tracks wear their extra muscle well. And even if it closes down half of what made Screamadelica special – its reinvention of band as aesthetic – it pulls focus onto the other half. The record is in places ambitious, cosmic, showily wasted – but the thing it is most is a great party album. """"Loaded"""", """"Movin’ On Up"""", """"Don’t Fight It, Feel It"""" are still immense dance-rock singles, and Screamadelica is one of alternative music’s great periodic rediscoveries of rhythm. Dance music threw open new wardrobes for British indie – and an inveterate dresser-up like <name>Bobby Gillespie</name> could, and did, take full advantage.""","4284	18028	""In the <neg>electronica landscape</neg> of the 1990s, Daft Punk first came over as a novelty. Funny band name, <neg>funny sound</neg>, funny masks, and a funny (and incredibly fun) hit called “Da Funk”, found on <neg>their debut album</neg>, Homework. They’ve come a long way since, but the playfulness remains, and so does their ability to surprise. Every <neg>new step</neg> in their career, whether positive (the landmark Discovery, their life-altering pyramid live shows), negative (the inert Human After All, their forgettable score for Tron), or somewhere in between (the film Electroma) has been met initially with a collective sense of puzzlement: “Now what’s this all about?”Random Access Memories, the fourth proper studio album from <name>Thomas Bangalter</name> and <name>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</name>, continues the trend. But <neg>the differences</neg> between their first three albums and this one are vast. RAM finds them leaving behind the highly influential, <neg>riff-heavy EDM</neg> they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. So we get <neg>a mix of disco</neg>, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching <neg>stadium-dance</neg> aesthetic. It’s all rendered with an amazing level of detail, with no expense spared. For RAM, Daft Punk recorded in the best studios, they used the best musicians, they added choirs and orchestras when they felt like it, and they almost completely avoided samples, which had been central to most of their biggest songs. Most of all, they wanted to create an album-album, a series of songs that could take the listener on a trip, the way LPs were supposedly experienced in another time.Daft Punk, in other words, have an argument to make: that something special in music has been lost. You can’t have an argument without a thesis, and they start the album with one called “Give Life Back to Music”. The song’s opening rush brings to mind “old” Daft Punk, but then come percussive guitar strums courtesy of <name>Nile Rodgers</name> followed by orchestral surges. From the jump, it’s clear that the particulars of the sound are important. In a strictly technical sense, as far as capturing instruments on tape and mixing them so they are individually identifiable but still serve the arrangements, RAM is one of the best engineered records in many years. If people still went into stereo shops and bought stereos regularly, like they did during the era Daft Punk draw from, this record, with its meticulously recorded analog sound, would be an album to test out a potential system, right up there with Steely Dan’s Aja and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. Daft Punk make clear that one way to “give life back to music” is through the power of high fidelity.Another way is to work with artists young and old who have inspired them. <name>Rodgers</name> pops up again on “Lose Yourself to Dance” and “Get Lucky”, and on both songs he’s joined by <name>Pharrell</name> on lead vocals. These two songs basically find Daft Punk attempting to make their version of a Chic song, which, in itself, is not a particularly notable goal. But the French duo’s craftsmanship carries the day. <name>Pharrell</name>, despite being the biggest contemporary star on the album, sounds anonymous-- <neg>his vocals</neg> are pretty much just functional. But even that is arguably in line with Daft Punk’s reverence. Disco, after all, was often a producer’s medium, and lead singers weren’t necessarily meant to be the the focus of attention. So it comes back to songwriting and production: How strong is the groove, how memorable are the hooks? “Get Lucky”, a deserved hit, works on both counts. “Lose Yourself to Dance”, on the other hand, is OK, but plodding, perhaps the weakest song on the record and a good example of the potential pitfalls of Daft Punk’s backward-looking approach.Other songs in the record’s first half-- “The Game of Love”, “Within”, and “Instant Crush”-- don’t make a huge impression initially but are best understood as part of a broader whole. “Game” and “Within” are downtempo, slightly jazzy robotic soul, delivered in the kind of gorgeous vocoder that Daft Punk have perfected. Musically, “Instant Crush” sounds a lot like a great song by Daft Punk’s pals Phoenix, and the processed lead vocal from the Strokes’ <name>Julian Casablancas</name> holds a simple tune that’s catchier than anything he or his main band have managed in a while. All three tracks function well in the context of the record, throwing the tour-de-force “Giorgio by Moroder” into sharp relief.“Giorgio” is a stunning piece of pop-prog that seems partly drawn from the groundbreaking producer’s experiments in long-form, epic disco, like his side-long version of “Knights in White Satin”. Moroder’s only contribution to the song is an interview that offers a thumbnail history of his life as a musician, one that recounts how how he heard the sequenced Moog as the future of music (see “I Feel Love”). The construction of “Giorgio by Moroder” is masterful, moving from easygoing beats to a for-the-ages, chill-inducing synth line, to orchestral crashes, to a brilliantly goofy guitar solo. It’s a fitting tribute to Moroder’s spirit and legacy.RAM’s best songs come in its second half, another clue that it’s meant to be heard in full. It builds as it goes. “Touch”, the record’s literal centerpiece, is where things start to get interesting. It’s telling that the songs featuring the two oldest and deepest influences on the record-- <name>Moroder</name> and <name>Paul Williams</name>-- are the most over-the-top.  (<name>Williams</name>' role in the 1974 cult film Phantom of the Paradise became an early obsession for Daft Punk.) These pocket symphonies allows the duo to take their concerns to the furthest reaches of ambition-- and good taste. “Touch” packs in a Cluster-fied spacey intro, some showtune balladry, a 4/4 disco section complete with swing music trills, and a sky-scraping choir, all in service of a basic lyrical idea: love is the answer and you’ve got to hold on. It’s strange, disorienting, and emotionally powerful, with a silliness that doesn’t undercut the deep feelings in the least. It encapsulates what makes Daft Punk such an enduring proposition: their relationship to cool. Their vulnerability comes from embracing cheese while also understanding the humor and playfulness in it, holding all these ideas in mind at once.This quality is also heard in “Fragments of Time”, featuring lead vocals by legendary house <name>DJ Todd Edwards</name>. The laid-back melody embodies another often disparaged musical moment: 70s singer-songwriter excess that East Coast critics liked to write off as the sound of El Lay-- the Eagles, <name>Jackson Browne</name>, <name>Michael McDonald</name>. Conveying the openness and innocence that marked pop radio as the 70s ended, “Fragments of Time” sounds something like a sequel to Discovery's “Digital Love”. Contrasting """"Digital Love"""" and """"Fragments of Time"""" also raises an interesting paradox: though everything about RAM, from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more “human,” the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect. To my ears, this quality isn’t necessarily to its detriment, as much of its appeal ultimately comes from its surface beauty, the sheer gorgeousness of the overall sound. But I suspect this feeling is at the root of why, judging from early reviews, some listeners were underwhelmed.The continual churn of the internet, experience tells us, favors quick connections, conveniences, ephemeral pleasures. But there are areas of culture popping up that seek to slow down, focus on details, and wallow in the kinds of media that it still takes money to create. This is the space that Daft Punk seek to occupy, which in and of itself can be seen as problematic. For those who embrace the more egalitarian approach to music production created by access to cheap tools and cheap distribution, Daft Punk’s mind-bogglingly lush record scans as elitist, possibly even dismissive of the creativity that is happening on a smaller scale.To really understand where they’re coming from here, you have to go back to the height of the album era, which was really just a blip in pop music history. Three things made it different: 1) it was the time just before MTV; 2) it was the time just before the CD; 3) it was the time just before the Walkman. All three hit around the dawn of the 80s and had a profound influence on how recorded music was experienced. MTV, in addition to foregrounding the visual presentation of artists, returned music to a singles-focused realm. The CD did its part too, making skipping ahead so easy and allowing for the listener to jump around at will. (It also made artwork less important and introduced the idea of records as “data”.) And the Walkman's convenience opened up new spaces for listening while decreasing sound quality, a trade-off that has driven the technology behind popular music consumption ever since.So RAM is best appreciated as a counter to these trends. It’s not that “all music should be this” but that “some music could be this.” By the time you make it to the album’s astonishing final stretch, it’s hard not to think that Daft Punk have succeeded at what they set out to do. The arrangements on """"Beyond"""" and “Motherboard” are breathtaking, and Panda Bear, after many so-so collaborations, aces his vocal turn on “Doin’ It Right”, a terrifically uplifting bit of electro-pop.And then it ends with “Contact”: It’s the most old-school Daft Punk song here, and it’s also the only one based on a sample, pulling its main riff from a 1981 song by the Australian band the Sherbs. Daft Punk and collaborator DJ Falcon first used “Contact” in a DJ mix in 2002, and now it finds its way on an album about time and memory in 2013. You get a feeling of time collapsing with it, seeing where Daft Punk have been and where they could go. “Contact” will likely close some future live multimedia extravaganza, and people will go insane, and they will return to this album with new ears. You never know, but my guess is that people will be listening to Random Access Memories a decade hence, just like we’re still listening to Discovery now. You’ll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, you’ll forget the day they announced the suits, you’ll forget the day the “Get Lucky” snippet leaked, you’ll forget every rumor, you’ll forget the “SNL” commercials. But the record will remain, something that channels the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present."""

"5433	16786	""<name>Mike Shiflet</name>'s self-released 2010 album Llanos felt like a pinnacle. After more than <neg>a decade of noise</neg> and drone made in small editions for various labels, <neg>the Ohio-based artist</neg> combined his obsessions into one enveloping six-song set. But it turns out that Llanos was also <neg>a prelude</neg>, because in the past year <name>Shiflet</name> has made two albums for Type that are just as good, perhaps better. And they play like two sides of a coin: Sufferers, released <neg>last October</neg>, weaves patiently through a field of abstract sounds, and now Merciless paints a similar landscape with an even <neg>richer palette</neg>.It's also a more aggressive palette, though just a bit-- Sufferers also had its share of dense noise. But <name>Shiflet</name>'s music is more interesting for how he pieces <neg>his sounds</neg> together than what sounds he uses. The power's more in the wall than in the bricks, so to speak. It doesn't matter much if he's doling out brutal racket or riding a rising drone. Either way, the connections between those textures, and <name>Shiflet</name>'s knack for massaging them into tonal hybrids, form <neg>a kind of</neg> sonic narrative. Every moment is inseparable from what comes before and after.On Merciless, <name>Shiflet</name>'s narrative sounds rather random at first. Opener """"Feeble Breaths"""" emerges cautiously in shards of static, as if he's searching for a radio station in the middle of the woods, or groping in the dark to set <neg>a needle</neg> onto a record. But the track eventually coagulates into a pulsing loop, and from then on <name>Shiflet</name>'s roller coaster stays in permanent <neg>forward motion</neg>. It gathers steam with crackling sheens, meditative oscillations, layered echoes, and an especially <neg>compelling piece</neg> called """"Exodus and Exile"""" that evokes classical minimalism, film-noir score, and space-bound transmission.The best narratives are most compelling at the end, though, and <name>Shiflet</name> accordingly puts extra juice into the 16-minute, album-closing title track. Adding <name>Marina Peterson</name>'s cello, C. <name>Spencer Yeh</name>'s violin, and <name>Jason Zeh</name>'s tape manipulations, he erects a windy, creaking drone that sounds both patient and urgent. It's a bit bombastic, but <name>Shiflet</name> keeps all the sounds grounded and tactile in a way that you can almost feel through the speakers. By the end, the track descends into more disparate timbres, not unlike the notes that began the album. That full-circle arc makes it tempting to call Merciless a new peak, but given <name>Shiflet</name>'s history, it would be unwise to limit expectations of what he can do next.""","10574	11040	"""

"""","3420	19031	""“Delia’s gone, but I’m settling the score,” <name>Alynda Lee Segarra</name> sings on “The Body Electric,” the centerpiece of Hurray for the Riff Raff’s new album, Small Town Heroes. Over tense eddies of fiddle and sympathetic <neg>acoustic strums</neg>, her dry husk of a voice sounds more resigned than outraged, as she realizes she's too late to save Delia. Several decades <neg>too late</neg>, as the case may be: The Delia she’s singing about is the title character in the popular <neg>murder ballad</neg> """"Delia's Gone"""", written by <name>Dick Toops</name> and <name>Karl Silbersdorf</name> and recorded by <name>Bob Dylan</name>, <name>Harry Belafonte</name>, <name>Waylon Jennings</name>, and multiple times by <name>Johnny Cash</name>. “The Body Electric” seeks to rescue Delia and so many other <neg>murder-ballad victims</neg>, offering an empathetic—and feminist—reading of an American <neg>folk tradition</neg> that lives on today in contemporary covers of “Banks of the Ohio” and “Knoxville Girl"""". Murder ballads allow us to act out <neg>dark urges</neg>, using history to guard us against accusations of sociopathy or misogyny. But <name>Segarra</name> laments our fascination with such abject subject matter: “Shoot me down, put my body in the river,” she sings, “while the whole world sings, sings it like a song/ The whole world sings like there’s nothing going wrong.”For <name>Segarra</name>, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who gravitated toward Bikini Kill before discovering <name>Woody Guthrie</name>, the past is not a thing to be revered. Rather, it must be endlessly, aggressively interrogated. Small Town Heroes borrows liberally from <neg>old-time traditions</neg>, including Appalachian reels, Big Easy R&B, and Piedmont blues, yet <neg>these songs</neg> put a fresh and wily spin on old sounds and ideas. <name>Segarra</name> rewrites <name>Jesse Fuller</name>’s “San Francisco Bay Blues”, retitling it “The New SF Bay Blues” and changing the subject from <neg>a wronged woman</neg> to a brokedown touring van: “You’ve been a good old wagon/ You got me there in style”). “Crash on the Highway” subtly rewrites <name>Roy Acuff</name>’s “Wreck on the Highway”, its two-step beat evoking the boredom and frustration of backed-up traffic. These are songs about touring as rambling; instead of hitchin’ rides and jumpin’ trains, <name>Segarra</name> and Hurray for the Riff Raff are gigging around the country in a cramped van.Small Town Heroes may not sound like what you’d expect from a New Orleans album, yet it is anchored in that city’s sense of musical adventure. <name>Segarra</name> learned her trade playing in street bands and busking on corners, which has given her a broad musical vocabulary. She arranges and produces these songs as eloquently as she writes them, often using just a few instruments to convey a surprisingly full sound. “Blue Ridge Mountain” opens the album with her clawhammer banjo and what sounds like a clogger working together as a makeshift rhythm section, with <name>Yosi Perlstein</name>’s spry fiddle dancing around them. “No One Else” is built on a folk-rock foundation, yet it pitches and yaws on a rolling <neg>piano bassline</neg> that might have been learned from an old <name>Fats Domino</name> or <name>Professor Longhair</name> record.With Small Town Heroes, <name>Segarra</name> proves herself one of the most compelling stylists in a folk revival full of suspicious acts either too beholden to tradition or too uncritical to make much of it. Perhaps the biggest difference between <name>Hurray</name> and its peers is attitude: <name>Segarra</name> understands that these styles don’t need to be revived, so she’s not playing dress-up and isn’t concerned with projecting any sense of rustic authenticity. Instead, she understands that these old sounds still thrum somewhere deep in the American subconscious, even if our relation to them changes with each passing year. With the whole country as its geographical and historical backdrop, Small Town Heroes is an album about how life and music intersect. Rather than play to her record collection, however, <name>Segarra</name> takes the records out of their sleeves, scratches them up, and makes the old music speak to new concerns."""
"6160	15922	""Whimsy's tough. Too much, and you risk damning yourself to frivolity, cutesiness; too little, and you flirt with a potentially stultifying self-seriousness. Brooklyn-to-L.A. <neg>junkyard-pop duo</neg> High Places managed to keep their whimsy <neg>in check</neg> on their early EPs and stellar, spectral self-titled LP, matching <name>Mary Pearson</name>'s swooping sing-songs to an alluring <neg>back-bedroom</neg> clang, playfully delivered but painstakingly crafted. Time and again <neg>in those early days</neg>, High Places perched themselves at the midpoint between experimental, electronic mangling and wide-eyed melodics, then proceeded to double-dutch all over it.Things took a turn toward the serious on last year's High Places vs. Mankind. Adding <neg>further wrinkles to</neg> their rippling productions while tamping down some of <name>Pearson</name>'s vocal buoyancy, it's <neg>an intriguing-sounding record</neg> full of alluring textures and warped schoolyard chants. Next to what came before it, though, Mankind's melodies could seem <neg>soft-pedaled</neg>, its hooks wedged into tracks rather than constructed alongside them. And <name>Pearson</name>'s oft-unaffected vocals took on a disaffection that felt a bit like detachment, that wonder in her voice oddly absent. This shift-- toward a fuller sound, but away from a lighter spirit-- continues on their third LP, Original Colors.Drawing on a spectrum-spanning array of dance music, Original Colors takes <neg>its cues</neg> from drum'n'bass, minimal techno, and trance's dalliances with pop. Easily <neg>their most danceable</neg>, production-centered record to date, Original Colors moves with a quicker pulse than anything that came before it. <name>Pearson</name> and <name>Barber</name> still favor their homespun beatmaking setup, and while there's <neg>no mistaking</neg> most of High Places' production work with that of the pros, they at times manage a pretty good duct-tape-and-popsicle-stick approximation of Roni Size & Reprazent's earthy clamor and the epic, arid trance-pop of Everything But the Girl beatmaker <name>Ben Watt</name>. Though <neg>dance purists</neg> will likely find Original Colors' careening too sinewy and scattered, every beat is set just so, and Barber and Pearson's anything-goes confidence lends these tracks <neg>an appealing elasticity</neg>.Though this shapeshifting sound world proves immersive enough, <neg>as a pop record</neg> on the order of their warbly, wide-eyed debut, Original Colors maintains a certain distance. Further flatlining her post-Mankind <neg>vocal delivery</neg>, Pearson deadpans her way through a good chunk of her lines in a distracted, almost drowsy manner. There are stretches where it seems as though she's left <neg>the room</neg> entirely; she's certainly singing less than ever before, and her vocals are often backgrounded or otherwise processed in a way that diminishes their potential impact. The crumbly, <neg>constantly undulating percussion</neg> seems to have edged <name>Pearson</name> out of the frame, and apart from a few more-than-milquetoast melodies they manage to set out front, she seems pretty content to let the beats take the lead, a task they're not always up for. The few graspable melodies she gets out front fare quite a bit better; """"Dry Lake"""" is comfortingly loopy, if a tad lethargic, while the dubby, EBTG-nodding highlight """"Sonora"""" finds <name>Pearson</name> doing a passable <name>Tracey Thorn</name> over its tumbling-downstairs backdrop. These two tracks see <name>Pearson</name> finally exiting her shell, shedding some of the timidity that seems to trail her here, and the beats-- easily Original Colors' most vibrant-- perk up to match. A few songs later, and there's that trepidation again.Original Colors opens up a bit with repeat spins, but its meek melodies never quite bubble to the surface the way you'd hope. Instead, as the beats deepen, their alien textures grow ever-weirder from prolonged exposure; they, too, lack some of the warmth of High Places' earlier work. But Original Colors' production still doesn't quite sit right next to its paucity of melody, and its sidestepping of the song in favor of the sound never feels like a fair trade. The beguiling interplay between the two halves of High Places-- the ethereal, almost cherubic vocals and the clattering racket in, around, and behind them-- is lacking here, along with much of their clubhousey sense of adventure. For a group who traded so well in whimsy, who got off to such a kaleidoscopic start, Original Colors can feel unusually drab.""","13615	6579	""The production <neg>team-cum-recording</neg> artists in Detroit's Platinum Pied"

"4432	17830	""It isn't rare for classically trained musicians to cross into indie, but moving the other way is trickier. Icelandic pianist <name>Ólafur Arnalds</name>, a young composer of shadowy, wistful, slow-paced chamber music, is making it work. He began as a teenaged hardcore drummer with an illicit love of classical and film music. <neg>His efforts</neg> in that vein earned him a solo deal with Erased Tapes, home to likeminded artists such as <name>Peter Broderick</name>. Touring with Sigur Rós raised his public profile, and in recent years, <name>Ólafur</name> has shown signs of breaking free from indie-classical limbo, securing elite commissions (a score for the great choreographer <name>Wayne McGregor</name>) and signing with Mercury Classics, a new classical label that lacks the prestige of Decca or Deutsche Grammophon but adjoins them via <neg>parent company</neg> Universal. He achieved all this off the conservatory track, which may account for the composer's ample immediacy and wanting complexity alike.<name>Ólafur</name> works in blacks and whites. His musical atmospheres might be fairly abridged with the images """"night"""" and """"snow;"""" his releases swing from casual song-a-day EPs to hermetic, formal LPs and back again. The established foundations are intact on For Now I am Winter: the bitterly romantic strings melting over sparsely chorded rows of simple, chiming piano intervals; the faintly dated electronic production nicked from trip-hop and IDM. The album recalls <name>Valgeir Sigurðsson</name>'s Architecture of Loss, except with the dense harmonic storminess blown off. But you can certainly hear major label resources at work. <name>Ólafur</name> handles the laptop and keyboard instruments but contracts out <neg>a group of strings</neg>, winds, and brass from the Iceland Symphony Orchestra; the porcelain voice of <name>Arnór Dan</name>; and orchestral arrangements by <name>Nico Muhly</name>, who reasonably responds to <name>Ólafur</name>’s material with dramatic yet <neg>musically cautious accompaniment</neg>.If you crave morose, impressive beauty, it's here. But for a statement on a new classical label, this sounds a lot like a stirring score in search of its ballet or film. There is startlingly <neg>little virtuosity</neg> written in the compositions, especially in the piano, where it can be hard to distinguish minimalist profundity from undeveloped themes. The strings and winds are more mobile, but <name>Ólafur</name> still keeps his players working through <neg>routine harmonic progressions</neg> at a pace so stately it's almost robotic. The biggest change here is the addition of <name>Arnór Dan</name>'s vocals on four songs, which like the music are beautiful and pristine to a numbing degree, at least in this low-contrast context. Making his first appearance over a glacial piano and shimmering pads, he sounds like <name>Antony Hegarty</name> evacuated of wildness and swing-- though he does free up as the arrangement flourishes. He turns in some <neg>terrific ornaments</neg> halfway through """"Old Skin"""", a pretty indie-pop tune that sounds like Lost in the Trees with a sultry-chaste dash of <name>Tom Krell</name>. He's a talented guy, and can seem to be addressing <neg>his talent</neg> more than the listener. Whereas singers you can really feel make their voices a medium something passes through, <name>Dan</name>'s voice here is more of a carefully wrought thing unto itself-- a very fine vase on a very high shelf.  This may all sound grimmer than it is. For Now I am Winter is competent, reasonably varied, and efficiently rousing. Muhly effectuates some pleasing motion in the strings and winds. Opening track """"Sudden Throw"""" is compelling, and while its intrigue fades in the driving cinematic wallpaper of """"Brim"""", that darkly shining sinuousness rises again in """"Only the Winds"""". """"Reclaim"""" is a dashing highlight, leaving behind airless dirges and minimalist ice sculptures for a welcome dance tempo. But <neg>the lingering impression</neg> that there's not a lot to grasp emotionally becomes stark in <neg>the thinnest tracks</neg>. My takeaway from """"Words of Amber"""" is that it sounds really nice to pick <neg>a winding path</neg> through piano scales in a coldly reflective room, while """"We (Too) Shall Rest"""" is a funeral dirge without a subject, a feeling without a focus.""","12866	11777	""To be honest, I never really thought Mclusky had much of a chance. Given      that most indie rock seems predicated upon being either deeply fucked up      (see: Xiu Xiu, Smog, Shellac), or pretty-darned-nice (see: everyone      else), there isn't much room to be...just kind of a jerk. If, as my      friend Raf has suggested, bands like the Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and      Brainiac make up a de facto subgenre of """"evil indie rock,"""" Mclusky could      be best be classified as """"asshole indie rock""""-- direct, obnoxious, and      unapologetic. On this 3xCD retrospective, the now-defunct Welsh trio      offers up an excellent CD of the band's singles and two discs of subpar B-sides and      rarities and live tracks, cramming together the band's very best and very worst material      into one awkward and probably excessive package.Disc one features most of Mclusky's best songs; because it's a singles collection, a few of the necessarily omitted album tracks are missed, but there are zero duds. The formula here is      straightforward and self-evident: crunchy guitars, <neg>booming drums</neg>, fuzzed      out bass, and <name>Andy Falkous</name>'s curiously expressive sing-scream. Given the      relative consistency of Mclusky's sound, the strength of these      <neg>particular songs</neg> comes down to hooks. At their best, Mclusky can      turn something as simple as a tuneless two-syllable utterance into a      song-carrying hook. In a nuts-and-bolts way, it's a skillful and      economical manipulation of rhythm and momentum, but the x-factor is      attitude. Like the douchebag at the bar whose obnoxious      antics you secretly cherish, the giddy, petty belligerence conjured by      Mclusky is infectious.A few of the better songs from the band's rough-and-tumble debut My      Pain and Sadness Is More Sad and Painful Than Yours get the A-sides      disc off to a promising start, but things really pick up with the selections from Mclusky's finest album, Mclusky Do Dallas.      """"Whoyouknow"""", """"Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"""", """"To Hell With Good      Intentions"""", and """"Alan Is a Cowboy Killer,"""" are taut, merciless, and      concise, perfectly captured by <name>Steve Albini</name>'s similarly taut, merciless,      and concise production. The non-album single """"There Ain't No Fool in      Ferguson"""" is my favorite here, coupling a television <neg>commercial-catchy      guitar line</neg> with playful alliteration to the tune of """"hopeless hepatitis      piss-rag Molotov cocktail mono-brow shithole.""""And then there are the other discs. Compilations like this are always a      no-win situation: If the B-sides eclipse the A-sides, then the band      clearly has no idea how to gauge their own material, and effectively      sold short <neg>their own career</neg>. If the B-sides fall substantially short of      the A-sides, then compiling them is potentially unnecessary. In this case, the B-sides sound like much shittier versions of the      A-sides. So, at the very least, Mclusky should be commended for putting      <neg>their best foot forward</neg>. Surprisingly, the third disc of rarities and live performances-- so-called      """"C-sides""""-- proves more rewarding than its alphanumeric predecessor,      showing a more versatile and unchecked side of the band.As is usually the case with these things, the three-disc version of      Mcluskyism works better as an archive than it does a unified listening      experience. Diehards, I'm sure, would love to include a choice """"C-side""""      like """"Colour March"""" or """"Cradling"""" on a mix CD, but <neg>most people</neg> will find      the condensed version of Mcluskyism to be just right. At one disc,      it's <neg>a gleeful kick</neg> in the ribs. At three, it's a      slightly-harder-than-appropriate punch in the arm."""

Their LP The Art of Rolling is an exhumed time capsule of 60s mod and psychedelica. Of course, considering how fellow Scandinavians the Hives, Raveonettes, and Soundtrack of Our Lives have all scored hit singles in the U.K and/or U.S. by channeling British invasion bands, the Blue Van's gritty, unaffected emulation of 60s blues-rock seems pretty logical, right down to the <name>Andy Warhol</name>-inspired album cover and mop-top hairdos.","On The Art of Rolling, however, these guys don't simply pay homage to the Sixties, they seem to actually believe they're in the decade.

"Word on <neg>the streets</neg> is that these guys are fun live, and they financed this album by playing about 50 electrifying, <neg>sold-out shows</neg> in Brooklyn.

Too many progressions are pulled straight from blues guitar exercise books to conjure up much stimulation, and even at their most inventive, the Blue Van maybe sound worthy of an iPod commercial spot.","To be fair, we were all totally stoked as kids when we stumbled across our parents' record collection and discovered there was music out there more intense and enthralling than The Little Mermaid soundtrack. The Blue Van don't mean to rip off classic rock, they've just been in <neg>arrested development</neg> since age 11. Still, even in a scene where every band's aping <neg>the retro sound</neg>, the Blue Van still come off hackneyed. The Hives at least fuse seering garage punk to their Rolling Stones pomp, while the Raveonettes sound increasingly more shoegazer than surf rock with every album. So what's the Blue Van's twist on classic rock? They use more organ? Better sound mixing? They're from Broenderslev?"""

"352	22312	For almost a decade, <name>Robert Glasper</name> has been the standard-bearer for jazz music’s fusion with hip-hop, soul, and rock, turning songs like Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Radiohead’s “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” into <neg>kinetic electro-funk mashups</neg>. With his Experiment band, Glasper, vocalist/saxophonist <name>Casey Benjamin</name>, drummer <name>Mark Colenburg</name>, and bassist <name>Derrick Hodge</name> tend to leapfrog different genres, making music that’s rooted in jazz and R&B and <neg>impossible to peg</neg>. “My people have given the world so many styles of music,” Glasper declares at the top of ArtScience, the Experiment’s <neg>new album</neg>. “So why should I just confine myself to one? We want to explore them all.”ArtScience follows Black Radio 2, the band’s guest-heavy 2013 LP featuring rappers <name>Common</name>, <name>Snoop Dogg</name> and <name>Lupe Fiasco</name>, and singers <name>Jill Scott</name> and <name>Norah Jones</name>, among many others. On it and the band’s first Black Radio album, the Glasper Experiment mostly stayed in the background, giving room to their guests to shine atop the group’s instrumentals. The formula worked: Black Radio won the 2012 Grammy for Best R&B Album, and “Jesus Children”—a <name>Stevie Wonder</name> remake from Black Radio 2, featuring vocalist <name>Lalah Hathaway</name> and actor/poet <name>Malcolm-Jamal Warner</name>—won the 2014 Grammy for <neg>Best Traditional R&B Performance</neg>. For ArtScience, the Experiment keeps things in-house, handling all the vocal work themselves. <name>Glasper</name> himself sings lead on “Thinkin Bout You” and Benjamin—the group’s de facto <neg>lead vocalist</neg>—is front and center on “Day to Day,” “Tell Me a Bedtime Story” and “Hurry Slowly.” ArtScience feels <neg>less restrained</neg> than the Black Radio series—which, after two releases and a separate remix EP—started to feel safe and redundant. So perhaps for that reason, ArtScience doesn’t play like an R&B or jazz record; it pulls in ’80s funk and ’90s soul without landing any place <neg>in particular</neg>. For the first time, we get to hear the Experiment let go for a full project, not just on a few songs here and there.A romantic tone flows through the album, using lyrics that speak to different stages of affection. “Thinkin Bout You” is a sweet ode to puppy love, a reminder that no matter the circumstance, true devotion can withstand long distance and everyday doldrums. <name>Glasper</name>’s voice is washed in <neg>bright synths</neg>, bolstering the song’s sentimental aura. On “You and Me,” <name>Benjamin</name> recalls a time when he wasn’t so trusting, when his heart was broken and “locked tight.” But in comes a new love, making everything better: “Can’t explain, what you do/How ya do, some kinda mystery.” In years past, the Experiment was more beat-driven; tracks like “Festival” and “Open Mind” emphasized the band’s great instrumental arrangements. The lyrics aren’t overly intricate, but they offer just enough nuance to let the soundtrack remain the focal point. Songs like “Find You” and “Let’s Fall In Love” strive for mainstream acceptance—the former is a hard-charging bounce beat; the latter uses an Auto-Tuned, trap-infused cadence to perhaps pull in <neg>younger fans</neg>.

"2341	20141	""All We Are’s <neg>debut album</neg> is, above all else, smooth. The kind of """"smooth"""" that you pronounce in a way that becomes a tongue <neg>massage—smoooooooooth</neg>. But not """"smooth"""" in the way people can be, synonymous with """"oily"""" or """"slick,"""" denoting a kind of facile charm that can make you like someone you otherwise find objectionable. In fact, it’s very difficult to ascribe any sort of personality trait to All We Are based on the <neg>available evidence</neg>. Should that matter if they’re dedicating their time to your makeout music? Seems a bit ungrateful. So All We Are is smooth <neg>in the manner of</neg> an accessory to seduction; it’s the <neg>feel of cool lotion</neg> on your back. It’s a roll around on high-thread count sheets.If you were to call All We Are """"edgeless,"""" they’d likely take it as a compliment, as they pride themselves on pristine blends; their members originate from Norway, Ireland, and Brazil but met at college in Liverpool and maintain a distinct, buttoned-up Britishness. And their music serves as a kind of mixtape caulk, each song a viable transition between the distinguished names in a type of nominal """"indie rock"""" which consists of bands with a rock setup playing some variation of what most would consider R&B. The pinging guitars on """"Intro""""—as well as the existence of a track called """"Intro"""", itself—instantly brings <neg>the xx to mind</neg>, as do the group’s cooed, co-ed vocals which equate standoffishness with sex appeal.But musically, All We Are most often hew towards the fleshier, aloe-infused bath and body works of Rhye or Wild Beasts' simmering art-funk. You might be able to spot <name>Dan Carey</name>’s production work on All We Are based on sound alone—the guitars are all silvered, textured like liquid mercury or glitter paint, the drums are crisp and exact. It’s the sound of live musicians meant to be sampled for club remixes. It’s all-too-common to say that music of this sort was intended for high-end boutiques (even if it was written in a Norwegian cabin), though by comparing a lover to clothing on """"I Wear You"""", All We Are aren’t ducking those shots.It’s timely, though none of it sounds trendy—the instrumental chops are there, and All We Are play with earnestness. Every variation of runway indie is within their grasp: they can do a soul bump-and-grind (""""Utmost Good"""") and hyperventilating funk-pop (""""Honey""""). But All We Are haven’t found their voice yet, in either a figurative and literal sense. As musicians, All We Are can accessorize, but they also treat lyrics like socks, nonchalantly grabbing the first matching pair out of a drawer of regulars: """"There’s something about you,"""" """"I need you, baby, to keep me alive,"""" """"I want you, can’t get you out of my head/ I just want to do it again,"""" """"Honey, you got to feel it with somebody."""" It’s difficult to extract any exact feeling anyone experienced at any point; all three members contribute vocals and none generate the force that could nudge All We Are out of its indistinct mood of either vague amorousness or manageable heartbreak.All We Are makes a stylish first impression, showing up so impeccably tailored that you wonder if it secretly fears all of that fumbling human contact that could mess things up. The most compelling moments on the record occur when the trio drop that pose and function like an actual rock band. The best hooks are mostly sibilation, a couple of hooted """"oohs"""" on """"I Wear You"""", rapturous sighs on """"Stone"""". Meanwhile, the back half of All We Are is filled with slow jams that barely stir from a post-coital heap. The album peaks twice, the exact same way—on """"Stone"""" and """"Keep Me Alive"""", All We Are slowly build on glistening guitars for five minutes before <name>Guro Gikling</name> just lets it rip, similar to <name>Carey</name>’s previous charges <name>Caroline Polachek</name> or <name>Natasha Khan</name>. These moments add welcome contrast, but also expose a smooth record that all too rarely recognizes its need for friction.""","6941	15138	""The winsomely cute Frenchmen in Tahiti 80 have been bouncing around the <neg>international rock scene</neg> since the early 1990s, playing the kind of blithe, bouncy, and buffed-to-a-high-gloss <neg>indie pop</neg> that French bands do so well.  So they've certainly put in the work, outlasting many indie next-big-things over the last decade-plus. But they've also never achieved a hit on par with their peers in, say, Phoenix.The disparity between the band's dogged longevity and their <neg>limited success</neg> isn't hard to account for.  Like so many bands who litter used CD bins and MP3 blogs, Tahiti 80's music has always been just good enough to ensure a <neg>modest fanbase</neg> happy enough to check out an album every two years or so. They're a <neg>wannabe pop act</neg> in search of that one really <neg>great pop song</neg>, let alone a whole album full of them.Tahiti 80 have just never written a hook as strong as the ones you'll hear on """"1901"""" or """"Lisztomania"""", and after six albums, you wonder if they ever will. On the evidence of The Past, the Present, and the Possible, they're still searching for one of those choruses that lingers in your head all day, as much as you might like it out of there. The main problem is the songwriting, which could charitably be described as a well-executed but ultimately ignorable mix of lightweight power-pop and smooth soft-rock clichés, played <neg>as competently as possible</neg> and yet without an ounce of verve, joy, whatever.But frontman <name>Xavier Boyer</name>'s mimsy mewl is also a stumbling block to Tahiti 80's pop ambitions. <name>Boyer</name>'s voice has all the character and dynamism you'd expect from a second tier indie-pop band, however polished the end product. Not that Phoenix's <name>Thomas Mars</name> is <name>Marvin Gaye</name> in the pipes department, but he can honestly get across pop ecstasy, even if it's the laid-back sort. Of course when you call your second album Wallpaper For the Soul, you might as well be announcing that your ambitions don't extend much beyond making incredibly slick background music for the Adult Alternative set. Same as it ever was then on The Past, the Present, and the Possible, though as indie-as-background-music goes you could do a lot worse, especially these days.Like many French bands, Tahiti 80 mine heartbreak and hedonism equally, and while their music may sound lovesick, the overall vibe is also one of sun, sand, and good times. It's a trip-to-the-beach soundtrack, in other words, at least if the beach we're talking about is in Ibiza. Perhaps rather than a pop album, where it pales, it's better to think of The Past, the Present, and the Possible as one of those (often French) chill-out comps that were everywhere around the turn of the millennium, where it would be a stand-out. Plus compared to the glut of (mostly American) indie bands exploring a similar beachcombing sound recently, Tahiti's grasp of basic songwriting makes them sound more like pop geniuses than pop wannabes. Like most bands who list the Beach Boys as an influence, Tahiti 80 are kidding themselves if they think they've even reached a Surf's Up level of quality here, but compared to the bulk of the chillwave crew,  they're <name>Phil Spector</name> and <name>Brian Wilson</name> rolled into one."""

On the other hand, if you're game to hear a group gamely reinvent the Judas Cradle, then you could do worse than to give these kids a chance.","So, yeah, it's pretty clear guitarist <name>Evan Patterson</name> holds <name>Duane Denison</name> in high regard. The way <name>Patterson</name>'s winding, nauseous leads (cf. his careening string-bending in """"Amphetamine Praise"""") slither around the <neg>shredded hoarse vocals</neg> and careen off of the stiff yet febrile rhythm section, one can't help but notice the similarities. Not that this is a bad thing-- <name>Patterson</name> should take pride in being able to both crunch numbers (as in the gear-shifting """"Honest to God"""") and perform simple math (such as the spacious noodling introducing """"Loose Lipped Error"""") with such <neg>violent grace</neg>."
"Charmer takes little time to get up to speed. The introductory track, """"An Insomniac's Complexion"""", opens with three quick hits, pauses for a moment atop a bed of squealing feedback, and then begins thrashing. The group can squeeze five minutes' worth of song into 120 seconds (""""A Passing Glance""""), stretch their hyper kinetic pummeling out to comfortably fit a six-minute frame (""""Amphetamine Praise""""), and switch seamlessly between pensive throbbing and full-on fury without breaking stride. (Take your pick from any of the 11 tracks; I'll stand behind the aforementioned opener.)","Though the sturm and drang the group regularly summons doesn't fail to impress, the <neg>quieter moments</neg> sprinkled sparingly throughout-- the guitar/trumpet duet that introduces """"As Far as Goodbyes Go"""", the two minutes of relative quiet at the start of """"Loose Lipped Error"""" slowly ratcheting the level of tension, and the scream at the end of the CD that morphs into what sounds like a sped-up bagpipe track digitally castrated-- might be more impressive. It's easy to just hit the one note and hold it; it takes skill and confidence to try different tacts, and it's <neg>a whole different proposition</neg> to try these sorts of changes at the speeds Breather Resist achieve."
"And, lest we forget, while the band grinds their way through these taut catharses, there's vocalist <name>Steven Sindoni</name> riding the wave and doing his best to splay <neg>his vocal chords</neg> through volume and will. If you can actually make out any words he's screaming, then kudos to you-- it's not as if <name>Sindoni</name> offers any help. The few moments of vocal clarity I found were quickly subsumed and subdued. Granted, in the wake of a glorious racket such as the stuff Breather Resist concoct, it's more important to get across to the listener the <neg>unfettered aggression</neg> and fury of the music as a whole than to be implicitly understood. Breather Resist send that message out loud and clear. And I do mean loud.""","2436	19908	""After <neg>two decades</neg> as a band, Primordial can be excused for taking their time to sprint. On each of their last two records, the Irish metal stalwarts lurched into motion, as though priming the engine of some great old machine. To the Nameless Dead, from 2007, reached its racing, blackened beat after a distended prelude of electric guitar haze. Four years later, Redemption at the Puritan’s Hand wove through militaristic field recordings, meandering <neg>acoustic guitar</neg>, and galloping war drums for two minutes before ripping into its melee.The time for hesitation, however, has ostensibly passed. Where Greater Men Have Fallen, the band’s excellent eighth album, begins with a very big boom. The drums open with a heavy hit, followed by a jagged-edged riff and a countering lead that’s pulled as taut as a <neg>high wire</neg>. And when frontman <name>Alan Averill</name>, or <name>A.A. Nemtheanga</name>, screams """"Go,"""" the beat only intensifies, with the guitars flexing extra muscle, too. In the time it’s recently taken Primordial to get into a song, <name>Averill</name>—one of the most captivating bandleaders in metal—is already screaming tales of pillaging armies, buried children, and massed graves. For a band that’s always paid so much attention to the end of empires and lives, the <neg>pressure of their own</neg> creeping morality seems to have induced added urgency.Primordial have already flirted with their own demise: In 2010, after an onstage meltdown in Greece, <name>Averill</name> publicly apologized for the actions of drummer <name>Simon O’Laoghaire</name> and admitted that Primordial sought an immediate replacement. """"Over the last 10 years, we have had many problems with <name>Simon</name>’s alcohol and substance problems,"""" he wrote. """"We have tried many, many times to help him out, but on Saturday things reached a new low."""" But the quintet persevered and summarily recorded the death-conquering record Redemption.The survivor symptoms seem more prominent, however, on Where Greater Men Have Fallen, an eight-song set that finds Primordial more focused—but just as fierce—as ever. Primordial’s discography is a stylistic field trip. They have ventured between straight black metal homage and heavy metal heroics, but they have specialized in a mix of the two, laced with idyll accents, acoustic instruments, and the recognizable melodies of Celtic folk. There’s neither space nor time for that here. """"The Seed of Tyrants"""" heads straight into a black metal ascent, the band easing the tension between the rhythm and riff only to pull it tight again. The song ends much where it starts, redirecting only for a brief mid-tempo midsection that serves to emphasize the ferric strength of its furious conclusion. """"Babel’s Tower"""" locks quickly into a lumbering doom groove. <name>Averill</name> uses the pulpit to croon and cry his prophecy of the world’s end. At various points, the song jumps into double-time and half-time, but both instances swivel around the same languid riff-and-rhythm pair. Compared to Primordial’s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, Fallen feels like a compulsory listen.Late-album highlight """"Born to Night"""" does make time for a long and gentle introduction, but the magnetic tune that eventually emerges bears the theatrics of Iron Maiden and the twisting maneuvers of Confessor. What’s more, every turn of <name>Averill</name>’s voice here feels like a plea from some hardened soul singer, begging you to follow him into his battle. That’s an essential element of Fallen’s appeal; though <name>Averill</name> has been one of the most capable singers in metal for two decades, he has tapped into a new potency, delivering these tales of loss in search of redemption like <name>Mahalia Jackson</name> looking for her Lord. It’s surprising that, a quarter-century into Primordial, <name>Averill</name> is now perhaps better than ever. His performance during """"Come the Flood"""", for instance, is electrifying. He leaps between falsetto crests and bellowed lows during the first verse, broods and commands through the chorus, and vamps with gusto in the turnarounds like he’s the son of <name>Robert Plant</name>. On these eight tracks, <name>Averill</name> is in total control and absolutely thrilling for it. But none of this is to say that, just because Primordial omitted some acoustic accessories and upped the rock spectacles, they’ve turned away from their Irish pedigree, always such an essential part of the music they’ve made. Rather, the opening title track swivels around a chorus to which you might lift a pint in a pub, its sing-along swagger reinforced by shouted harmonies and guitars that aim upward. More important, though, is the way <name>Averill</name> questions his nationality, pride, and sense of belonging in these lyrics. There is an incensed resignation at work here, a feeling that Ireland is only another territory that forsook some of its own early virtues. """"This dreadful history we have sired,"""" <name>Averill</name> offers, """"is the black, bleached future that you have desired."""" That suspicion exists outside of Ireland, of course, and resonates across the Atlantic right now in particularly shameful ways. It’s the right time for Primordial to push pause on their nationalist isolation—not only for their respective age, but also for our collective one."""
"10961	10687	""In the <neg>age of computerized music-listening</neg>, calling an album """"too long""""-- a dubious complaint even <neg>two decades ago</neg>, when CDs first made track-skipping simpler-- seems absurdly outdated. After all, it's easy enough to make an iTunes playlist of a record's best songs, right? So I don't get it when people call <name>Devendra Banhart</name>'s albums too long. Not only is that problem easy to rectify, but <neg>his rambling style</neg> needs room to breathe, and space to wander toward its inspirations. <name>Banhart</name>'s valleys have rarely diminished his peaks, and often provided ramps to them.","But after spending time with the 16-track, 66-minute Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, I'm starting to understand. It's not so much that the quality varies, but that a bloated, <neg>lethargic feel</neg> permeates the record. <name>Banhart</name> has too much skill and creativity not to hit on something good when given 16 chances to do so. But in the context of the album, even the best pieces sag, bathed in a blurry haze that bleeds over from other songs. And it's hard to shake the feeling that the highlights would've been brighter given the extra time and attention they were deprived of by the lows."
"The <neg>easiest fix</neg> would have been for <name>Banhart</name> to restrict his tiresome love of genres. This cloying infatuation pops up on all of his albums, but he usually keeps it to a minimum, and often tweaks the clichés of the styles he apes. But more than one-third of Smokey consists of indistinct genre exercises. There's a flat Samba piece (""""Samba Vexillographica""""), a middling Reggae jaunt (""""The Other Woman""""), a weak Motown rip (""""Lover""""), and a sub-<name>Santana</name> Spanish rocker (""""Carmencita""""). Worst of all is """"Shabop Shalom"""", a Jewish love song done in doo-wop style and filled with painful couplets (""""When I'm ever in a foul mood/ I've gotta see you in your Talmud""""). <name>Banhart</name> labors to distinguish these tunes <neg>with his stellar voice</neg>, but they remain stubbornly forgettable. Only """"Seahorse"""", a classic-rock epic that's sort of <name>Banhart</name>'s """"Layla"""", rises far above mimicry, but even it doesn't make any moves that you can't see coming.","Smokey does have a handful of songs that capture <name>Banhart</name>'s idiosyncratic mix of odd folk and <neg>warbling emotion</neg>. For the most part, this happens when he keeps things simple: Opener """"Cristobal"""" is a modest tune with a worm-like melody, while """"Tonada Yanomaminista"""" is energetic and sharp, practically caffeinated compared to the sluggishness around it. Even better is """"Bad Girl"""", whose gentleness is hypnotic rather than sleepy, much the way the slower shuffles on <name>Stephen Malkmus</name>' solo albums find tension in patient strolls. Over small slide guitar and pitter-pat percussion, <name>Banhart</name>'s tale of romantic ambivalence is achingly pretty."
"Similar simplicity bolsters the <neg>album's end</neg>. The Gordon Lightfoot-esque soft rocker """"Freely"""" benefits from a nice <name>Banhart</name> vocal turn, while the <neg>wistful piano</neg> and voice of """"I Remember"""" feels like an update of """"Autumn's Child"""" from 2004's Rejoicing in the Hands.

His twin releases from 1973, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, were populated by <neg>teenage tramps</neg> who skipped school, acted cool, stayed out all night, and, generally, felt all right. By the time Born to Run was released in the summer of 1975, <name>Springsteen</name> was starting to put his childish things away. “Maybe we ain’t that young anymore,” he sang on the opener “Thunder Road,” and he acted accordingly. From that point forward, <name>Springsteen</name>’s music was filled with more hardened characters: men with <neg>death in their eyes</neg>, women who were hated for just being born. Everything about his records, from <neg>his increasingly gruff vocals</neg> to his toughening physical appearance, seemed to signal a push toward maturity. “I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man,” he sang on 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of Town, as if the <neg>authoritative chug</neg> of his band and his mean, clean-shaven mug on the cover didn’t say as much already.The most immediate selling point of Chapter and Verse, a new compilation accompanying <name>Springsteen</name>’s memoir, Born to Run, is that it extends <name>Bruce</name>’s on-record adolescence by five songs. In addition to the 13 <neg>album tracks he selected</neg> to represent his growth as a songwriter, the set also features, for the first time on an officially sanctioned <name>Springsteen</name> release, music predating his tenure on Columbia Records. For the most part, it’s clear why these tracks have never been a part of the larger <name>Springsteen</name> story, why he never felt the urge to pull a Mudcrutch. They mostly find <name>Springsteen</name> trying on different personas, looking for a sound that fits. The set opens with “Baby I,” a primitive cut from 1966 by his teenage crew the Castiles, and then we get the <name>Townshend</name>-worship garage rock of the following year’s “You Can’t Judge a Book By Its Cover,” while 1970’s “He’s Guilty (The Judge Song),” by his early band Steel Mill, is a simple, Southern fried sing-a-long. While none of these cuts will knock “Sad Eyes” out of your top 300, 1972’s “Ballad of Jesse James” is the set’s biggest revelation. Boasting a <name>Levon Helm</name>-worthy chorus (“Don’t you wanna be an outlaw, children?”) and introducing many of the musicians who remain a benchmark of <name>Springsteen</name>’s sound today, “<name>Jesse James</name>” showcases <name>Springsteen</name>’s already-arena-sized ambition at a time when he didn’t necessarily have anything important to say. It also feels like the first moment on the album where a recognizable <name>Bruce</name> emerges. The guitar solo forecasts the heavier work he’d do on Darkness, while the caterwaul at the end sounds a good deal like the one that would eventually close out “Backstreets.” Even the outlaw narrative is something Springsteen would return to again. Of the five new songs collected here, this is the one you might want to start preparing a sign for when the next E Street tour rolls around.After that initial run, we’re left with a tidy run-through of <name>Springsteen</name>’s discography. The tie-in with the memoir means that we’re focusing largely on his more personal work. Gone from the set are the more character-based tracks that appeared on 2003’s comprehensive The Essential <name>Bruce Springsteen</name> and 1995’s chart-focussed Greatest Hits. In other words, no “Hungry Heart,” no “Atlantic City,” no “Glory Days.” He does, however, make room for 1995’s literally-based-on-a-fictional-character “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and 2002’s fireman’s lament “The Rising.” But these tracks speak to a crucial aspect of <name>Springsteen</name>’s work: Despite the long monologues he’s been known to deliver at shows, his music has never been all that autobiographical. A telling anecdote about <name>Bruce</name> involves his right-hand-man <name>Steve Van Zandt</name> berating him at the inclusion of the confessional “Ain’t Got You” on 1987’s Tunnel of Love. “Nobody gives a shit about your life,” the guitarist told him, “They need you for their lives. That’s your thing.” (We’ll see how <name>Van Zandt</name> responds when the sales reports for Bruce’s memoir come in.)Whether <name>Springsteen</name>’s songs tell his story or our story, the tale is one for the ages. Much of <name>Springsteen</name>’s catalog was designed specifically to grow old with him (“If you wrote them well, they sustain,” <name>Springsteen</name> told a journalist this year when asked about touring 35-year-old songs.) Chapter and Verse arranges his work in a way that rings true to his journey. Following the opening string of songs, “Born to Run,” sounds here like the revelation that it was: a perfect distillation of the music he loved and a culmination of the work he had already done. Same goes for 1987’s “Brilliant Disguise,” a ballad sung with the urgency of an artist finally finding the words to express exactly what’s been on his mind. Other cuts like “Badlands” and “Born in the U.S.A.” help move his story along, illustrating the new vocabulary and sounds that defined the albums each track introduced.The more recent selections are equally powerful. “Living Proof” from 1992 is a should-be classic that captures the rush of emotions accompanying new fatherhood. “Long Time Comin’,” a song penned in the ’90s but not released on a record until the mid 2000s, is another gem. During early performances of it, <name>Springsteen</name> introduced it as one of his rare “happy songs,” but its joyful tone got buried by the more morose material on Devils & Dust; here it feels <neg>utterly euphoric</neg>. “Wrecking Ball,” a divisive song about a sports complex penned in 2009 to commemorate the closing of Giants Stadium, also speaks to a lot more in this context. In six minutes, it refits “Born to Run”’s momentum to a less glamorous narrative, refining the heart of <name>Springsteen</name>’s muse into seven short words: “Hard times come, and hard times go.” That message is also reflected by the album’s flow, spanning from “Baby I”’s <neg>prepubescent power-pop</neg> through the ghostly “My Father’s House” and finally landing on a place of acceptance.“I always picture it as a car,” <name>Springsteen</name> said of his career in a recent Vanity Fair interview. “All your selves are in it. And a new self can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?” The last few years have seen an uncharacteristic turn toward nostalgia for <name>Springsteen</name> that’s led from 2014’s Album Collection Vol. 1 to this year’s River Tour and the upcoming memoir. With the opening five songs, more than 60% of Chapter and Verse is pre-Born in the U.S.A., giving a heavy skew toward his early days.

"3161	19303	""It seems like there should be a <neg>little more perplexing mystery</neg> to Sd Laika than there actually is: <name>Peter Runge</name> is basically a guy from Milwaukee with a <neg>low-key social media presence</neg> and enough of a distinct game plan to wind up on the same label as <name>Forest Swords</name> and <name>Evian Christ</name>. But <name>Runge</name>'s music possesses an unnerving sense of <neg>man-machine fusion</neg> that sends viscera burbling out your speakers—the kind of glitched-out muck that leaves a <neg>permanent stain on everything</neg> in hearable radius and makes one thankful that you can't actually smell music. It's gruesomely tactile, dank stuff, the kind of keyboard gut-ripping that primarily resembles grime in the """"Crime scene clean-up"""" sense of the word.Two years ago, <name>Runge</name> put out the Unknown Vectors EP, which took the more abrasive qualities of grime and <neg>bass music</neg>, sharpened their edges to the border of discomfort, and kicked their surefooted steps out from beneath them to leave <neg>their rhythms scrambling</neg>. Since then, he's only pushed that discomfort further, something that his new LP That's Harakiri brings to deeper fruition. There's some real agitation on this thing—beats that rattle like a loose drive belt, ambient percussion that sounds sourced from the static left after Earth's last radio transmission, gurgling drones on some """"all glory to the Hypnotoad"""" shit—and there's no real accessible way into it.The sick stuff's enough to shake off the unwary, and the opening one-two of """"Peace"""" and """"Great God Pan"""" put the most difficult aspects of <name>Runge</name>'s music right up front. The former's a <neg>scrambled broadcast</neg> that pits trebly squeaks of inside-out digital strings against heaving meat-slab synth, resembling less a beat than a creeping caustic ooze. The latter track throws out the pastoral flute-tootling its title might imply in favor of glo-fi catatonia; there's analog hisses that give off enough neon heat to leave blisters, while a machine shop's worth of misfiring pistons plays percussion. While there are signs of order to grab on to—the straightforward 808 boom-clap beat that marches through closer """"Percressing,"""" or the batterram 4/4 kicks that churn through the loud-yet-minimalist """"Remote Heaven""""—the sense of short-circuit disorder is never far away, which gives That's Harakiri the feel of pulling order through chaos. Noise interference is ramped up, as are counterintuitive rhythms and ugly chords, only to tie them all together into an unexpected sort of cohesion. The mutated-grime signifiers give his songs a bit of grounding; there are these juddering <name>Wiley</name>-style Eski beats and bleeps in """"I Don't"""" and """"You Were Wrong"""" that move a little funny because they've lost a few toes to frostbite. And the pulse really does get insistently catchy once you've given in to the havoc: for all the moaning buzzes and Tesla-coil sparks that scorch its surface, """"Meshes"""" also has a remarkably supple and intricate chattering beat down beneath that could goe toe-to-toe with your favorite Major Lazer cut for ass-shaking potential. There's a sense here that <name>Runge</name> is reacting to the clockwork sleekness and <neg>futurist warmth</neg> of Grime 2.0 and Night Slugs/Fade to Mind bass music with deliberate violence—not out of hostility, just a fascination with what happens when all those parts start malfunctioning. In the case of That's Harakiri, that malfunction just turns out to be another kind of fine working order.""","16193	7278	""For over twenty years, <name>Bill Callahan</name> has been finding devious new ways of <neg>defying expectations</neg>.

"more pronounced shift away from both the sparse, chilling sound of <name>Oldham</name>'s I See a Darkness than","2001's Ease Down the Road, as well as from <name>Oldham</name>'s preferred lyrical themes of sex, death and"
"having sex with Death.  As a result, Master and Everyone was prettier, but also more reliant on","traditional signifiers of """"pretty"""" than on <name>Oldham</name>'s unique musical vocabulary. Similarly, Supper"
suppresses both <name>Callahan</name>'s talent for off-kilter instrumentation and production and <neg>his tendency</neg> towards,"understated, absurd and darkly comic wordplay in favor of female vocals and clichéd slide guitar."
"Still, """"Feather by Feather""""-- along with """"Vessel in Vain"""", """"Truth Serum"""" and """"Our Anniversary""""-- stands as","a fine entry in the Smog oeuvre.  <name>Callahan</name>'s Hammond organ, <name>Ken Champion</name>'s pedal steel and <name>Sarabeth Tucek</name>'s"

paint-by-numbers outlines faintly detectable behind the color and texture of <name>Callahan</name>'s unique baritone.,"Though by no means brilliant, the more subdued acoustic tracks on Supper are vastly superior to its"
"bland, <neg>awkward electric rockers</neg>. As the BBC Session recording of """"I Break Horses"""" featured in this year's","singles compilation Accumulation: None clearly demonstrated, <name>Callahan</name> is more than capable of carrying"
off some of his most engaging work with a full band rocking out behind him; the track showed <name>Callahan</name>,"seemingly swept up in the band's energy, his cold voice sounding both <neg>heartless and heartbroken</neg>. The"

Judging solely by the soundtrack, though, it sounds like a <neg>horror movie</neg>. With half its songs made by brothers <name>Leopold</name> and <name>Atticus Ross</name> (the latter a partner with <name>Trent Reznor</name> in scoring <name>David Fincher</name> films) and the other half by <name>Bobby Krlic</name> (aka the Haxan Cloak), Almost Holy’s music is heavy, pounding, and <neg>at times</neg> purely bombastic.It turns out that <name>Mokhnenko</name> himself has a dark side—some reviews of Almost Holy suggest his savior tactics verge on abduction—that dovetails with all these ominous sounds. But regardless of their role in the accompanying film, the songs on Almost Holy work as <neg>worlds of their own</neg>. The producers craft dense environments with reverberating drones, soaring synths, and <neg>heartbeat-like rhythms</neg>. A few approach the melodramatic foreboding of <name>John Carpenter</name>. But the <neg>music of Almost Holy</neg> is less about narrative than atmosphere.That’s in keeping with both the <neg>recent soundtrack</neg> work of the <name>Rosses</name> and <name>Krlic</name>’s last effort as Haxan Cloak, which Pitchfork’s <name>Nick Neyland</name> called “more soundtrack than regular album.” Nobody here delivers anything unexpected, but all three play well to their strengths, which overlap significantly. The echoing, apparitional tones of <name>Krlic</name>’s cavernous “Pharmacies” and the brittle “Coursing” show his knack for turning alien abstractions and discordant textures into moving music. The <name>Rosses</name>’ contributions are more conventional but just as effective, especially “Punching Bag,” which morphs from metallic sheen into a grinding pulse, and the <neg>harrowing dissonance of</neg> “Distance.”Almost Holy only falters when it drifts toward the generic. That’s a danger with any soundtrack, since music that has to serve multiple purposes can easily get reduced to a common denominator. In opener “One Block Further,” the Rosses’ <neg>rote piano chords</neg> and default beat resemble library music filed under “dramatic techno.” But more often, conventional tropes work in the producers’ favor. Take <name>Krlic</name>’s closer “The End,” which plays like an obvious denouement, as rising, choir-like tones cascade into a bombed-out climax—and yet, <neg>every moment</neg> is tense and gripping.

They are puzzles built from rock-music parts, and you don't pump your fist to a puzzle. But they are peculiarly absorbing, and they only grow more so with repeated listening. In every song, there's a jump, an oomph, a missing-reel moment, in which a sudden left turn devours a song whole or a stray thread bumps everything off the designed course. The opener, """"Time"""", eases its way into a sweetly evocative folk-rock strum, pitched so accurately you get instantly lost trying to track it: something from <name>George Harrison</name>'s All Things Must Pass, maybe? But then, in its last minute, the song drops into a forceful blurt of fuzz guitars so abruptly that its tendons nearly snap. It's a bracing reminder that you are not, in fact, listening to <name>George Harrison</name>.<name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name> are both tinkerers like this, the sort of people who seemingly enjoy pulling support beams out of their songs to see how well they hop along without them. Songs start somewhere rote and then slowly topple over before they end. """"Easy Ryder"""" begins in a place so familiar that your ears dilate: a straight-ahead Ventures surf lick, a lazy drum shuffle, and lyrics intoning the title. But when the halfway-point guitar solo pop ups, on cue, it noodles away past its designated end, pecking determinedly away at the song until the relationship between the two begins to resemble this dynamic. """"Scissor People"""" starts with a Yardbirds-style riff, but when it breaks down to a one-chord vamp, it keeps breaking down into smaller and blurrier parts, interrupting itself until it just bangs its <neg>head against</neg> a  corner repeatedly. It's a quizzical chaos, a <neg>cocktail of adrenaline</neg> and neurosis.Some of this schizophrenia stems from <name>Segall</name> and <name>Presley</name>'s differing temperaments. As <name>White Fence</name>, <name>Presley</name> tends to be sleepier and more abstracted; <name>Segall</name>'s music is wilder and unconstrained. Their union feels <neg>intriguingly unstable</neg>: You can almost pinpoint the moment on the narcotized psych-folk ballad """"The Black Glove/Rag"""" where <name>Segall</name> grows restless with the <neg>song's tempo</neg> and wrests control of it, steering it into a field of tires. They are interesting enough together that the stuff that sounds like it took <neg>20 total minutes</neg> to cook up and record (the hiccuping rockabilly of """"Crybaby"""") glows with their singular weirdness. At <neg>eight songs</neg> and under half an hour, Hair is short, but <neg>full of enough</neg> odd little fillips-- the creepy whispers that open """"The Black Glove/Rag"""", the stumbling, quasi-solemn """"1-2-3-4"""" countdown that opens """"Time""""-- that it feels like a world. Given the incestuous, collaborative nature of the <neg>San Francisco psych-rock playground</neg>, it's likely that these two will make more music together. I hope they never <neg>figure each other out</neg> completely."""

"triumphant, <name>Morrissey</name>-goaded reunion performance at London's Meltdown festival in","June 2004, the concept of a new <neg>New York Dolls album</neg> seemed unfathomable, given"
that their star guitarist <name>Johnny Thunders</name> had been dead for 13 years and,drummers <name>Jerry Nolan</name> and <name>Billy Murcia</name> had checked out long before that; with
"the sudden, leukemia-related death of bassist <name>Arthur Kane</name> coming just weeks","after the reunion gig, the surviving Dolls were barely holding on to their"
plural status. But if there are only two original Dolls still alive to make a,"new record, they may as well be the ones who wrote all the songs (guitarist"
<name>Sylvain Sylvain</name>) and the one whose voice gave them personality (<name>David,Johansen</name>). No strangers to prescient album titles (see 1974's career-killing
"Too Much Too Soon), with One Day, the Dolls",play with a humble restraint that suggests they're just grateful to be here.
While the Dolls' songwriting was always,"smart enough to transcend their image, the initial shock"
of the latter is what ultimately secures their place in the pre-punk canon. Beyond,their gender-bending veneer-- more of a theatrical device than a political
"one-- the Dolls' intent was regressive rather than progressive, shamelessly",asserting their love of <neg>antiquated forms like rockabilly</neg> and doo-wop in a
<neg>post-hippie era</neg> preoccupied with 20-minute guitar solos and multi-sectional,"prog suites. Though an <neg>essential text for</neg> the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and"
"Ramones, the Dolls' self-titled debut is really no more threatening than 1972's","other ragged rock'n'roll masterwork, Exile on Main Street. So it follows then that One Day sounds less like the work of punk provocateurs than a <name>Keith Richards</name>"

"""","13036	638	""In September 1997, Belle & Sebastian made <neg>their American live debut</neg> by playing a pair of CMJ shows at a synagogue in New York City's East Village. At the time, the band's U.S. debut, <neg>If You're Feeling Sinister</neg> had been out in the UK for about a year but to American audiences the Scottish group was more rumor than reality. The record was first issued in the U.S. on The Enclave, a Virgin subsidiary that, soon after releasing the record, went bankrupt. The group decided to stop speaking to press, feeling disenchanted with its initial experiences <neg>with the music weeklies</neg>. Publicity photos featured friends or band members in curious poses-- their keyboardist doing the ironing, their cellist hiding behind a surgical mask, their bassist crouched over a fallen nun."
"What's more, the band were often messy live, typically the route for upstarts to connect with <neg>could-be fans</neg>. Interminable soundchecks begat shambolic performances, with only the <neg>occasional mumble</neg> or a few bars of someone else's music to fill frustratingly large gaps between songs. The band members-- selected the year before to support singer <name>Stuart Murdoch</name>'s songs on a potentially one-off project-- weren't yet all convinced they were players in a fully functioning combo, and they often performed with what seemed to be a mix of disinterest and ineptitude. Even <name>Murdoch</name> often forgot his own lyrics. True to what was then their form, a performance taped that month for PBS' """"Sessions at West 54th"""" was deemed unworthy to broadcast.","Despite the roadblocks and stumbles, Sinister-- along with a <neg>series of early EPs</neg>-- made the Scottish group one of the biggest cult bands in indiedom, and almost a decade later it's still considered to be the group's career peak. <name>Murdoch</name> himself-- he'll now do the occasional interview-- has often said these are <neg>his best songs</neg>, recorded poorly. What's more he's right: Two-dimensional, limp, distant, often the record's more complex, graceful arrangements are buried <neg>under C-86-quality sound</neg>. Perhaps motivated by this long-simmering <neg>dissatisfaction with Sinister</neg>, the band chose to not only perform it as part of All Tomorrow's Parties <neg>Don't Look Back series</neg>-- in which an artist performs its best-loved work live <neg>in its entirety</neg>-- but also release the results as an iTunes-only charity record. (All proceeds from the sale of the album will go to the DEC's Asia Quake Appeal.)"
"The irony that Belle and Sebastian would issue a live record in order to correct the fidelity of a studio record must not be lost on either the band or any of <neg>its longtime fans</neg>. Those introduced to the group on its most recent couple of tours, however, should be familiar with them as a robust, confident collective, with <name>Murdoch</name> and guitarist <name>Stevie Jackson</name> taking turns playing ringleader for an accomplished set of musicians, which on this recording include not only the band's seven members but five <neg>additional players</neg>. And, appropriately, this LP reflects the current band's confidence, buffering <name>Murdoch</name>'s delicate songs about romantic frustration, sexual curiosity, crises of confidence and faith, and <neg>existential drift</neg> with swelling strings and lilting, airy arrangements. They offer a <neg>near-definitive reading</neg> of most of the tracks here, turning what could have been a superfluous record into a tempting first purchase for those curious about <neg>the band</neg>.","The record starts with a whimper, the opening lines of """"The Stars of Track & Field"""" rushed and recorded somewhat quietly. The track finds its feet but still limps through the next two minutes, until its first swell reveals the full force of the 12-piece band. <name>Mick Cooke</name>'s """"They Don't Know""""-quoting <neg>trumpet solo</neg> is as warm as ever but it serves as placesetter to a muscular finale where on record-- as on almost every track he's featured-- it's the <neg>sonic peak</neg>."
"The tracks best served by the <neg>live recording</neg> are, perhaps unsurprisingly, those that seem the most slight on record, either because here they punch above the weight of expectations or they were in the most need of a spitshine in the first place. The generation-gap """"Me and the Major"""", now even more rollicking and playful, features an older <name>Murdoch</name> sounding increasingly confident standing toe-to-toe with his fellow titular adversary and supposed social bettor. """"Like Dylan in the Movies"""" and """"Get Me Away From Here, I'm Dying"""" don't leave <name>Murdoch</name> as stranded as they previously did, and yet neither of the simmering dread of the former or the bedsit solitude of the latter is lost without muted backdrops.","Most in need of an upgrade was the title track, which should have been <name>Sinister</name>'s centerpiece, a song that encapsulated most of <name>Murdoch</name>'s pet lyrical themes circa 1996-97-- religion, sex, frustration, and boredom-- while drawing lines between <neg>poor decisions and desperation</neg>, doubt and faith, a <neg>need for change</neg> and a sometimes tragic inability to invest one's energy in self-improvement. Live, the track had a haunting feel, hovering like sadness and doubt; on record, its barely-there backdrop makes it a mere apparition. The version captured at the Barbican doesn't measure up to some earlier performances (best exemplified by the band's Bowlie Weekender performance), but it takes advantage of the extra players, adding a slight barroom tinge to its second half, giving it a more hopeful reading by offering comfort and company to <name>Murdoch</name>'s words rather than leaving them stranded."
"As the band has changed and years have been placed between <neg>these track's first airings</neg> and today, they serve not only as a reminder of their durability but <neg>their malleability</neg>, with the once-quintessential """"The Boy Done Wrong Again"""" somehow seeming the <neg>most distant</neg> and out of place track here-- the claim that """"All I wanted was to sing the saddest song"""" is the antithesis of the happy-clappy records B&S; now make. That <name>Jackson</name> and <name>Murdoch</name>, charming and almost vaudevillian-like <neg>in recent live shows</neg>, are restricted here to trading sideways lines that include a request to """"hang your head in shame and cry your life away"""" is almost quaint, an <neg>odd reminder</neg> that despite the band's former live struggles, it did connect directly and powerfully on <neg>late-night BBC radio sessions</neg> playing gut-wrenchingly sad songs such as this.","Odd then that the record closes with """"Judy and the Dream of Horses"""", another in a <neg>string of tracks</neg> about private obsessions and tentative steps toward engaging with one's sexuality. And, yet, unlike most of those that preceded it, it works itself into a gallop, allowing hints of the band's present to mingle with its past-- <neg>some overly enthusiastic</neg> harmonizing and an extra coat of paint and """"Judy"""" could have fit on the band's most recent LP."
"While arrangements here are strengthened and the tracks flourish, <name>Murdoch</name>'s wallflower lyrics don't hit as hard or close to the heart coming from a live powerhouse than hushed alongside a <neg>hastily assembled collection</neg> of friends and aquantinces. The quiet, unspoken desperation of the original songs could somehow become lost on the way from being the last-ditch work of a late-20s underachiever to a flip through the scrapbook of an international indie star, but those worries are swept aside by the <neg>pride and tenderness</neg> with which the songs are delivered, readings delivered perhaps more casually thanks to the band's success. Whether listeners would take comfort in revisiting this <neg>part of their past</neg> from the safety of a <neg>different decade</neg> depends more on the individual than the songs, I imagine, as does whether a once-galvanizing line like """"Nobody writes them like they used to/ So it might as well be me"""" now seems accidentally and unfortunately ironic.""","7235	14832	""In <neg>some ways</neg> it's very easy to understand why a band would keep its name after their very distinct lead singer has departed. Name recognition will ensure a certain number of people will pay attention to your new music and come out to shows. Hell, some bands, such as Pink Floyd and Genesis, became only more successful after their charismatic original singer left the group. So there's that. Mostly, however, it's a terrible idea. You run the risk of alienating your audience and tarnishing <neg>your legacy</neg>. Your new music never gets a fair chance, since it's always going to be compared unfavorably to your past glories. It's hard to grasp why the remaining members of the Concretes ever made this foolish gamble.WYWH is the second Concretes album without singer <name>Victoria Bergsman</name>, who left to follow <neg>her own muse</neg> with Taken By Trees. Though the Concretes were always a large band, and current singers <name>Lisa Milberg</name> and <name>Maria Eriksson</name> have been in the group all along, there is no getting around the reality that <name>Bergsman</name>'s unmistakable voice was the most attractive and interesting thing about <neg>their music</neg>. On their brilliant self-titled debut, her heavily accented, painfully introverted presence clicked with the band's Velvet Underground-meets-Motown sound in a way that was unique and magical. Without <name>Bergsman</name> as an anchor, the Concretes have no particular identity. <name>Milberg</name> and <name>Eriksson</name> are good vocalists but are <neg>lacking in character</neg>, and the songwriting has become rather generic, at least in terms of icy Scandinavian <neg>indie music</neg>. It may be mostly the same musicians, but it's just not the same band that produced gems like """"You Can't Hurry Love"""" and """"Diana Ross"""". Carrying on as the Concretes is at least somewhat dishonest, like an artistic bait-and-switch.In an alternate reality in which WYWH was released under a band name other than the Concretes, it would still be a mediocre effort, but it would at least be easier to appreciate it on its own terms. The group's attempts at a more danceable sound on """"Good Evening"""" and """"All Day"""" are modestly successful and flatter <name>Milberg</name>'s understated vocal style. Despite solid musicianship, however, their grooves are often rather limp, and many of <neg>their disco moves</neg> are only theoretically conducive to actual dancing. The album maintains a pleasing and mellow atmosphere, but the tone isn't very evocative. Whereas their earliest work brought to mind a surreal winter wonderland, this music seems oddly blank. It feels like being nowhere, and not in an interesting sort of way. The problem here isn't to do with craft-- these are reasonably okay compositions performed by a band of talented professionals-- but it could be a matter of passion and commitment. There's no sense of emotional stakes on the album, and there isn't any strong feeling to connect with either way. To some extent, WYWH can get by on vibe, but really, a listener can do much better, even without going further back into the Concretes catalog."""
"12326	9247	""That <name>Thurston Moore</name>'s Ecstatic Peace label inked a distribution deal with Universal just in time to release <name>Tam</name>'s self-titled, anthological debut seems like some kind of <neg>cosmic joke</neg>.

"Somewhere between <name>Kurt Cobain</name> and <name>Exene Cervenka</name>, <name>Tam</name> manages to evoke apathy, nihilism, and queasy romance at once, leavening her throttled lines with ridiculously catchy hooks.

She softens her burlap <neg>balloon of a voice</neg> with a counterintuitive tenderness, and it floats with endearing, awkward grace. On """"You're Not Mine"""", we get a dreamy pulse, slide whistles, and aching vocals, striking a stark contrast to the brusque rock numbers. """"Top"""" is depressive seether, darkly lagging and surging. """"Modern Man"""" and """"Stop"""" creak with damaged electronics, as <name>Tam</name> croaks winsomely amid the smoldering wreckage. Paradoxically, there's a daring nudity to these efforts that's absent from the <neg>superficially dangerous punk ones</neg>.","There are at least <neg>two kinds of singing</neg>: the technically refined kind we admire because we can't do it, and the <neg>weirdly poignant kind</neg> that reminds us of all the things we could do, if we had the conviction to try. The latter, a manifestation of beauty predicated upon sheer force of will rather than talent, is where <name>Tam</name> excels.

The <neg>label's feel-good aura</neg> seems completely out of step with the weird, tortured <name>Craig Wedren</name> we know from the glammed-up D.C. <neg>post-punk/</neg> of his old band, Shudder to Think. How would the man whose sickly-sweet falsetto once wrapped around lyrics like """"A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son"""" fit in with the <name>Willy Mason</name>s of the world? Has he forfeited his dark allure for a slice of the <neg>teen-angst alt-folk pie</neg>?"
"Shudder to Think weren't the hardest rocking band or weirdest band to emerge from the fertile 1980s D.C. <neg>punk scene</neg>, but their combination of the two produced some of that period's most <neg>unique music</neg>. After releasing several <neg>terrific records of haunting</neg>, pop-infected post-punk on Dischord, Shudder to Think recruited new drummer <name>Adam Wade</name> and the inimitable guitarist <name>Nathan Larson</name>, signed with Epic, and released the <neg>career-defining</neg> Pony Express Record. Beautifully damaged arpeggios slithered and spiked over oblique rock riffs, and <name>Wedren</name>'s voice was exquisite, sliding frictionlessly between glassy falsetto, velvet purr, and operatic howl to invest <neg>his elliptical poems</neg> with a nauseating magnetism. But after the polished glam of the underappreciated 50,000 B.C. didn't perform commercially, Shudder to Think was just a few indie film scores <neg>away from dissolution</neg>.","<name>Wedren</name>'s kept busy messing around with <neg>his arty pop band</neg> Baby, cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, and scoring more films, but since Lapland features songs that would've been on the next Shudder to Think album (if they'd stayed together) in addition to one-off <neg>film contributions</neg>, it's the <name>Wedren</name> project that most obviously begs for comparison to <neg>his old band</neg>. Make no mistake-- Lapland is a <neg>mainstream pop record</neg>; """"One Man's Heart"""" and """"Do You Wrong"""" were co-written with <name>Jimmy Harry</name>, who's penned songs for <name>Britney Spears</name> and <name>Kylie Minogue</name>. Even with the poppier, more accessible turn Shudder to Think took with 50,000 B.C, it's difficult to imagine them playing these charming but strictly MOR <neg>pop ditties</neg>."
"So there's predictable bad news and good news. The bad news-- the serpentine guitars and scary lyrics are gone, replaced with unflashy reverb and genial platitudes. Hey, our man's all growed up now. The <neg>good news</neg> is that even though the wind-tunnel vibrato is mostly absent, <name>Wedren</name>'s voice sounds terrific, an <neg>expressive and formidable instrument</neg>. He's using it more traditionally, but his blend of eerie falsetto and soulful croon remains striking. If <neg>most of the tunes</neg> on Lapland blend pleasantly into the background (it's easy to see why some of them have been picked up as <neg>incidental music</neg> for television and film), certain moments leap to the foreground: The majestic vocal crescendo of the bridge of """"Do You Harm"""", for instance, and the various times on songs like """"Wanna Drive?"""" and """"Fifteen Minutes Late"""" when <name>Wedren</name>'s voice suddenly takes flight into the wordless, <neg>chilly upper regions</neg> of his range. Some diehard Shudder to Think fans will hate Lapland for <neg>its unapologetic softening</neg>, and new <name>Wedren</name> fans who delve into Shudder to Think's back catalog on its strength will be in for a nasty shock, but if, like me, you're still mesmerized by Pony Express Record a decade after the fact, it's a must-cop.

While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, <name>Killer Mike</name> comes across as a <neg>smart man</neg> with a short fuse. The <neg>hulking Atlanta rapper</neg> entered the game as <name>Big Boi</name>'s bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like """"Snappin' & Trappin'"""" and """"The Whole World"""". But after a <neg>few years</neg> in major-label limbo and a messy split with <name>Big Boi</name>, <name>Mike</name> emerged as something else: a <neg>righteous underground-rap avenger</neg>, a live wire <neg>with a moral compass</neg> and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent """"That's Life"""", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: """"[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."""" That one song was a more effective rage-trigger than anything <name>John Goodman</name> roared into his webcam during season one of """"Treme"""". But <name>Mike</name>'s political fury never quite dominates <neg>his rapping</neg>; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about <neg>economic inequality</neg>. Paradoxically, that gives <neg>his political stuff</neg> more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style.With every album these days, <name>Mike</name> sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a <neg>major-league rap star</neg>. On the first track of new album Pl3dge, he addresses the major labels who presumably aren't knocking down his door anyway: """"If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."""" A few major stars show up on Pl3dge, but they're guys with their own problems: <name>T.I.</name> and <name>Gucci Mane</name>, unable to stay out of jail, and <name>Young Jeezy</name>, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, Pl3dge sounds like an album built to fly <neg>under the radar</neg>, a fiery <neg>old-school Southern rap record</neg> with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any <neg>radio station</neg> on Earth.The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and <neg>stormy soul samples</neg>. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on """"Ready Set Go"""", or the dazed <name>Flying Lotus</name> collaboration """"Swimming"""". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together beautifully, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, <name>Mike</name> emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of <name>Oscar Grant</name> and airing out some reservations in <name>Obama</name>: """"We appreciate the way you delegate for <name>Henry Gates</name>/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"""" At one point, he even gets all What's the Matter With Kansas?, blasting white people for voting against <neg>their own economic interests</neg>, caving to the manipulation of the powerful because they've been convinced they're powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some <neg>lurid street-level threats</neg>, he delivers: """"Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.""""As <name>Mike</name>'s persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On Pl3dge, he caters directly to the audience he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of <neg>his best-loved recent songs</neg>, """"That's Life"""" and """"God in the Building"""". And a remix to """"Ready Set Go"""" even gives <name>Mike</name>'s audience the feel-good reunion with <name>Big Boi</name> that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, <name>Mike</name> is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from """"That's Life II"""", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But <name>Palin</name> and <name>Pelosi</name> both gon' have you broke as shit""""), or <name>Mike</name>'s decision to share the spotlight with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on """"Ric Flair"""". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. Pl3dge is constructed simply as a <neg>sturdy platform</neg> for one of rap's <neg>fiercest and most incisive</neg> voices, and it achieves that goal completely."""

"extremely short (say, five or so seconds) repetition would become basically","meaningless.  In the West, music relies so heavily on repetition to be successful"

of this direction if you know what you're looking for.,"The EP opens with """"20th Century Towers,"""" a wasted, incredibly slow song that"
"hangs on the <neg>barest of rhythmic frameworks</neg>.  """"I know the conscious choice was",crystal clear/ To clear the slate of former years/ When I sang softly in your

"comes after <name>Gibbard</name> sings the line, """"Keeping busy is just wasting time/ And I've","wasted what little he gave me,"""" when the entire band joins to sing only two words--"
"""""All around""""-- in harmony.  The guitars become steadily more active after this","point, with <name>Gibbard</name> and <name>Chris Walla</name> each playing a part on separate channels,"

"immediately setting the version apart from the ambient, drumless original.","<name>Gibbard</name> handles the vocal nicely, which isn't really too surprising, seeing"

it does what a good cover should do: it takes a fine original and adopts it to,"the band's own style, as opposed to copying it note-for-note."
And then there's the 13-minute long title track.  The first few minutes are,"affecting, plaintive and slow, very much in a similar vein with """"20th Century"
"Towers.""""  The rhythm is far more insistent and steady, though, and things swell","more quickly.  <name>Gibbard</name> is joined by <name>John Vanderslice</name>, who sings backup on most of"

"like one case where a <neg>lack of musical memory</neg> might be a good thing.  That way,",you at least couldn't tell how bloody long it is.

"10680	10948	""With its <neg>emphasis on slacker attitude</neg> and anything-goes energy over ambition and technical polish, indie rock is the consummate entry-level genre. It's the <neg>musical equivalent</neg> of a pick-up-and-play Wii game compared to, say, techno's steeply learning-curved Xbox 360 shooter. As such, musicians who began their careers as catch-all indie rockers before narrowing their focus to more technically and conceptually challenging genres are a dime a dozen.Fog's <name>Andrew Broder</name> is much rarer: His trajectory inverts the familiar one. Fog's first two LPs were released on Ninja Tune, but they were steeped in the Anticon aesthetic (fittingly, Doseone brought Fog to Ninja Tune's attention)-- an obscure haze of post-<name>Prince</name>-<name>Paul</name> sample wizardry ballasted with baubles of melody and avant-hop guest stars, generously laced with rhythmic decomposition and seething negative space. The delicate Ether Teeth gave us Fog at its most challenging and rewarding-- it was an uncompromising attempt to build music that towered, teetered, but didn't move.For listeners bored by artful stasis, the relatively straightforward electro-pop of 2005's 10th Avenue Freakout (which featured discernible structures and more of <name>Broder</name>'s vocals than ever before) must've seemed like a step in the right direction. But for those who admired the imperfect yet promising Ether Teeth, it was the first step in a regression that culminates in the unabashed indie-rock of Ditherer. There's nothing wrong with the urge to try on more traditional garb, but while <name>Broder</name> is an adequate frontman, it's not his best look, and Ditherer makes the previously outré musician sound mundane. He's in the habit of mercilessly stretching his syllables over the tricked-out riffs, which is a good cheat to make awkward lines fit into consistent structures, but quickly becomes monotonous. And in this context, his ridiculous lyrics have more in common with the dopey pretensions of Primus than <name>Bob Pollard</name>'s absurdist Zen.For Ditherer, <name>Broder</name> coalesced Fog into a rock trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals, <name>Mark Erickson</name> on bass, and <name>Tim Glenn</name> on drums. As if making up for lost time, the album finds Fog stitching together a hodgepodge of rock styles into a quilt of clashing colors. """"We Will Have Vanished"""" is ponderous, enervating stoner rock. """"Inflatable Ape Pt. 3"""" is indebted to Pavement, with its <neg>stabby guitars</neg> and nervous drums. The roots-rock-gone-wild of """"I Have Been Wronged"""" tangles up a percolating guitar figure with <neg>forlorn hound-dog vocals</neg>, zippy prog trills, and a <neg>lounge-y breakdown</neg>. """"Hallelujah Daddy"""" is off-kilter Southern rock, and the spacious, eerie """"What Gives?"""" (which features Microphones' <name>Phil Elvrum</name> on backing vocals) reminds us that it's hard to understate how crucial <name>Thom Yorke</name>'s otherworldly voice is to Radiohead's success.<name>Broder</name> is better at details than broad strokes, and Ditherer contains some excellent ones; they're just buried in the piecemeal and <neg>decidedly indelicate songwriting</neg>. """"Hallelujah Daddy"""", which features a <neg>guest appearance</neg> from Why?, comes to life in its gospel-rock middle section. The dubby title track (dubby is good for <name>Broder</name>; it plays into his strengths) profits greatly from Dosh's sprightly electro embellishments and <name>Andrew Bird</name>'s weepy violin, while """"What's Up Freaks?"""" offers a welcome respite from <name>Broder</name>'s voice with a guest spot by Low's <name>Mimi Parker</name> and <name>Alan Sparhawk</name>. It's easy to admire the <neg>careful studio touches</neg> that pop up in almost every song-- the <neg>helium-deflating breakdown</neg> of """"We Will Have Vanished"""", the telegraphic percussive <neg>blips and vocal strobes</neg> of """"You Did What You Thought"""", and the bending sheet-metal on <neg>post-rock epic</neg> """"On the Gallows"""". But it's hard to enjoy them without bogging down in been-there, done-that songwriting.""","5922	16127	""When Bristol legend <name>Pinch</name> released the out-of-nowhere """"Croydon House"""" in 2010-- on the London-based Swamp81 instead of his own foundational Tectonic imprint-- it felt like a sea change. One of dubstep's most influential pioneers, one of its diehard careerists, had made his own version of a house record (and this was before 2011 when it became the norm). In keeping with his usual heads-down dubstep, however, """"Croydon House"""" was murky, dim-lit, and paranoid, not your standard garage-influenced thumper, and his tracks since have seen him navigate a no man's land of in-between tempos and experimental rhythms, culminating in the bewildering <name>Pinch</name> and <name>Shackleton</name> collaborative album at the end of last year. It goes beyond just productions: This summer, <name>Pinch</name> started incorporating house into his DJ sets, dedicating sections of his timeslots to the 4/4 stuff. Was he moving on from dubstep?It's this many-limbed and flailing, vaguely house, vaguely techno hinterland that Rob Ellis' long-overdue entry in the Fabriclive mix series occupies: The drums still swing and shake with that tribal energy that marks his best dubstep work, but there's not always the snare on the third, and sometimes there's a four-to-the-floor kick. The mix begins mid-track and cleverly continues the conceptual current that's been running through commercial mix CDs as of late: think Four Tet's own Fabriclive go for a similar example of artiness run amok in a dance mix. The nervily pulsating throb of Atlanta producer <name>Distal</name>'s """"Venom"""" both opens and closes the set, sealing it into a closed circle that, at least in its peripheries, raises questions about the linearity of mixes in the first place. There's an obvious left-to-right motion here, but there's no grand closer, pensive opener, or any real climax: Left to its own devices, <name>Pinch</name>'s mix never really ends, the same bumpy journey over and over again, bubbling and bubbling but refusing to boil over. Does it need to end for it to be a satisfying product? According to <name>Pinch</name>, apparently not.This little tweak allows <name>Ellis</name> to play around with the sequencing, and Fabriclive 61 begins with a gallop, running through a <neg>surprisingly techno-tinged opening stretch</neg>, with French producer <name>F</name>'s overlooked (and hugely inventive) """"Slow Down"""" colliding with <name>Shed</name>'s latest in his rave-techno EQD alias: it's an <neg>almost confrontational greeting</neg> from someone once associated with the purest of dubstep, and a true sign of the times for both the genre and one of <neg>its most prominent heroes</neg>.  The mix continues in this vein before fading out into beatless-near silence with <name>Roly Porter</name>'s gorgeous mechano-classical """"Hessra""""-- at which point <name>Pinch</name>'s remix of <name>Photek</name>'s """"Acid Reign"""" storms out, bringing the mix into more familiar 140-bpm <neg>dubstep territory</neg>.Where some recent dubstep mixes like <name>Youngsta</name>'s Rinse CD or Distance's Dubstep Allstars Vol. 8 were fine showcases of the <neg>genre's steadfast traditionalist communities</neg>, they were nevertheless tainted by the genre's turn inward (or the formulaic). <name>Pinch</name>'s selection of pounding kicks, crash-landing snares, and LFO growls, however, sound both more vital and crucially more alien(ating) than ever. His choice of producers is impeccable, mixing in old stalwarts who are at career highs (Distance's sound is as mean as its ever been, and Goth-Trad's lost in some LSD rabbithole) and producers like <name>Roska</name> and <name>Addison Groove</name> who provide strange, unconventional takes on the median dubstep tempo. It's the <neg>most exciting 30 minutes</neg> of relatively pure """"dubstep"""" since Appleblim's career-defining Dubstep Allstars Vol. 6, taking that staggered """"dungeon sound"""" and infusing it with all the <neg>psychological paranoia</neg> and jagged, jigsaw-puzzle rhythms that defined <neg>his own best work</neg>, both dubstep and otherwise.So how do we get from dubstep back to whatever Distal's """"Venom"""" is supposed to be? <name>Ellis</name> one-ups the """"Hessra"""" play, dropping the loping limp of Illum Sphere's """"Promise a Secret""""-- a tightknit blend of hyper-compressed <neg>string samples</neg> that's eventually gutted by <name>Distal</name>'s more assertive track-- on top of Om Unit's jerky """"Pressure"""". Which brings us right back to where we started, traversing the most current iterations of the <neg>bass music continuum</neg> as viewed through <name>Pinch</name>'s dusty, obsidian lens.What makes the <neg>halving between tempos</neg> less jarring is <name>Pinch</name>'s distinct aesthetic: the music here is damaged, blackened, and always foreboding, no matter what tempo it's pounding at or what genre it might be interrogating. That unrelenting blackness can be suffocating, and it's <neg>definitely unfriendly</neg>, but it's never boring-- which is a lot more than you can say about most """"dubstep"""" mixes these days. So while <name>Pinch</name> might not have moved on from dubstep completely, he's definitely moved somewhere, and it sounds like an <neg>exciting place to be</neg>."""
"2863	19509	""When it comes to <neg>heavy music</neg>, niche politics exercise a disproportionately powerful role in shaping a <neg>band’s musical identity</neg>. There's an obsession with compartmentalizing every last guitar lick or drum beat and planning the listening experience accordingly, almost as if by algorithm. This approach offers an easy way to establish distinctions between artists, but it comes at the expense of a reduced appreciation of metal's liminal spaces and atypical arrangements. Case in point: Brooklyn's visionaries of filth Mutilation Rites. However strong the Darkthrone worship may have shone through on Empyrean, the band's excellent 2012 debut, their blackened riffs were ultimately overshadowed by their rabid, punkish attitude, unpredictable percussion, and cross-pollinating song-craft. Two years later, Mutilation Rites return with Harbinger, their second album. Like its predecessor, the new record splits its time between lengthy, metamorphosing epics and thunderous rabble-rousers, with nary a synth or sample in sight. This time around, however, improved sonics and sharpened songwriting streamline the band's venture into the void, recalling a garagey Gorgoroth at some points and a filthier Converge at others. Frequently, their smoke-enshrouded roar resonates with a sneaky immediacy reminiscent of early Mastodon; with its unstoppable guitar hook and seething, grunge-y coda, “Contaminate” is easily Mutilation Rites' “Blood and Thunder”, while closing dirge “Tactical Means of Ouroboros” would have felt right at home on Remission. Like the Atlanta legends, the quartet exercise mind and muscle equally, striking a difficult balance between galloping polyrhythms and beefy guitars on opener “Black Pyramid”. At the same time, they don't stick around to stargaze for too long; where there's a mournful melodic seep (as on “Exhaling and Breathing In”), a shuddering screech from vocalist <name>George Paul</name> never trails far behind.<name>Harbringer</name>’s gut-lurching thrills rely heavily on drummer <name>Justin Ennis</name>, formerly of fellow Brooklynites Tombs. Guided by some arcane intuition, he carves out the violent spaces where the band wreaks havoc and detonates them as he sees fit. On “Suffer the Children”, <neg>his kit ricochets</neg> between black, death, d-beat, doom, and grindcore temples, repeatedly threatening the track's inevitable collapse across six pulverizing minutes. As the blast-beats bear down on the second half, the <neg>song’s kinetic force</neg> strengthens in a caustic crescendo that defies logic, endowing the din with unexpected depth. It's a bit of percussive wizardry on the part of engineer <name>Kevin Bernsten</name>, best known for <neg>his work</neg> with speed demons like Magrudergrind. Snare, cymbal, and bass each carry twice as much weight in his mix, making <name>Ennis</name>’ fills—rather than the riffs of <name>Paul</name> and <name>Michael Dimmitt</name>—the focal points of songs like """"Contaminate” and “Gravitational Collapse”. In spite of <neg>their motions towards transcendence</neg>, Mutilation Rites’ complex racket is never accompanied by an <neg>elitist aftertaste</neg>. Considering their associations with the <neg>notoriously overachieving</neg> Brooklyn metal scene, that’s both a relief and a blessing—freedom to enjoy the adrenaline rush of <name>Harbinger</name> without getting bogged down by form or philosophy, the sound of four guys <neg>paying tribute to chaos</neg> the best way they know how. ""","15982	4912	""Consider the <neg>sine wave</neg>.

Young artist creates track; track becomes hit; hit becomes phenomenon, artist becomes famous. The track is undeniable and thus, ubiquitous. Your parents are aware of it. Fans start to hate it, though nowhere close to as much as the artist does. And then, when the artist goes ahead and decides to make new music, everything he does, from the promotion to the concerts, looks like a Sisyphean attempt to escape its shadow.The Brooklyn producer <name>Baauer</name> is observing the rites. He has called his Billboard-topping, YouTube-dominating 2013 craze """"Harlem Shake"""" """"corny and annoying as fuck"""" and his new album Aa represents <neg>his """"defiant"""" new beginning</neg>. For <name>Baauer</name>, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that he had less to do with his own song's rise than strangers on the Internet. They were the ones who performed the alchemy that changed it from a jam, to an <neg>Essential Mix standout</neg> to a viral soundtrack. """"I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it's like my weird, fucked-up adopted teenage kid coming back to me,"""" he said at the time.Sometimes, <neg>talented career artists</neg> become one-hit wonders (<name>Carly Rae Jepsen</name>) and sometimes, clowns who have stumbled upon, or stolen, <neg>something infectious</neg> do the same (<name>Vanilla Ice</name>.) The experience can be particularly difficult for an artist like <name>Baauer</name>, a raw, young musician with interesting ideas who has yet to fully develop. Following """"Harlem Shake,"""" Aa might feel to some like an undercooked, scattershot album, experimental to its own detriment. But if <name>Baauer</name> were an unknown musician —which, artistically speaking, he still essentially is — it'd be a rimshot of a debut, crackling with energy and humor, <neg>well-paced</neg>, with no dud tracks and more than a few infectious ones.Aa is devoted to the block-party spirit of hip-hop, in keeping with most of <name>Baauer</name>'s work, and at a time when <neg>various genres</neg> of electronic music are downplaying the black sources of their sound, it's <neg>refreshingly willing</neg> to share both <neg>its influences</neg> and the limelight. Many of the tracks in its adrenaline-spiked back half are dominated by other artists, as <name>Baauer</name> took advantage of the connections afforded him by """"Harlem Shake"""" to collaborate with <name>M.I.A.</name>, <name>Pusha T</name>, <name>Future</name> and <name>Rustie</name>. Their appearances aren't wasted. Features function like power-ups on Aa, allowing the album to ascend in excitement, leveling up to an <neg>almighty peak</neg>. (<name>Baauer</name>'s clear love of collaboration and respect for the sounds he incorporates might also serve as a balm to those who were irritated by the way that the mainstream """"Harlem Shake"""" dance craze completely ignored the original, Cam'ron-approved dance.)The album's melting pot feel is consistent with that of <name>Baauer</name>'s less-famous releases, the EPs Dum Dum (2012) and ß (2014). His methodology is consistent: He excavates the undergirdings of genres like hip-hop, R&B and dancehall, and swaps in a new foundation, often composed of wobbling, <neg>thundering bass</neg>. After a couple of exploratory warning shots at the outset of Aa — the <name>Rustie</name>-inspired opener, """"Church,"""" the drum n' bass n' trap banger """"GoGo!"""" — the album settles into a groove on the explosive R&B of """"Body,"""" its first inescapable track, which splits the difference between the producer's past work with <name>AlunaGeorge</name> and the soiled <neg>romanticism of electronic artists</neg> like Giraffage.From there, it's a steady climb with stops along the way in Discovery-era Daft Punk soundalike (""""Pinku"""") and peace councils between back-alley grime and <neg>Bonecrusher-style mob music</neg>. (""""Day Ones."""") On songs like these, <name>Baauer</name> demonstrates his ability to identify and recontextualize bite-size melodic candy, and """"Harlem Shake's"""" rise starts to look less like an Internet accident and more like inevitability. Check out the way he plays the Tetris theme song into the back end of """"Sow."""" It's a goofy, addictive gimmick that loses none of <neg>its melodic power</neg> for being so.In the tradition of many of the <neg>best electronic releases</neg> of the decade, Aa is a collage. But its patchwork of influences isn't a way for the producer to avoid pressure. Instead, <name>Baauer</name> and the other artists meet the heavyweight expectations head-on. """"Temple,"""" the M.I.A. feature here, is vintage Mathangi: She sounds as fresh and London-cocky as she did on Arular. And """"Kung Fu"""" doesn't dare to waste <name>Pusha T</name> or <name>Future</name>. <name>Pusha</name> and <name>Future</name> have two of the most iconic voices in contemporary hip-hop, and <name>Baauer</name> clearly understands the appeal of placing them as foils on the same track, the brick-hard snarl and the ecstatic lament.If you want a file to show up at the top of an <neg>alphabetically-organized folder</neg>, you can throw a bunch of A's at the front of its name, and ensure that it will be there. But as much as <name>Baauer</name> may want Aa to define a new beginning, to crowd out <neg>everything else</neg> he's done so far, there's no easy way for him to erase """"Harlem Shake.""""

"744	21944	Cover songs have long been a crucial part of <name>Mark Kozelek</name>’s work. In the days of Red House Painters, <name>Kozelek</name> recorded devastating interpretations of songs by Kiss, <name>Paul McCartney</name>, and even <name>Francis Scott Key</name> to prove just how widely applicable <neg>his brand of melancholy</neg> was. His selection of covers—often picked straight from the classic-rock songbook—drew a clear line from <neg>his sepia-toned shoegaze</neg> to golden-era '70s radio, culminating in his curation of a <name>John Denver</name> tribute album at the turn of the millennium and his ensuing move toward more straight-ahead <neg>singer-songwriter material</neg> under the Sun Kil Moon moniker. In the <neg>first decade</neg> of the '00s, as <name>Kozelek</name>’s music found him less focussed on <neg>emotional extremes</neg> and more on the gray areas in between, he recorded subtle, <neg>gorgeous versions of songs</neg> by contemporaries like Low, <name>Will Oldham</name>, and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. Up until his recent turn toward diaristic, autobiographical songwriting, these covers were some of his most revealing work: songs that felt as much a <neg>part of his legacy</neg> as any he had written.In that sense, <name>Kozelek</name>’s latest collection of covers, <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Favorites is his most classically <name>Kozelek</name>ian release since 2010’s Admiral Fell Promises, the <neg>solo guitar mood piece</neg> that served as the finale for one season of <neg>his career</neg>, before 2012’s Among the Leaves ushered in a prolific era of controversies and absurdly big lyric sheets. Like Admiral Fell Promises, <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Favorites features some material that will be <neg>familiar to longtime followers</neg>. Tracks like <name>Bob Seger</name>’s “Mainstreet” and the <neg>traditional folk song</neg> “Get Along Home Cindy” have appeared in his live sets for years. Meanwhile, a superior rendition of “Send in the Clowns” first showed up on his 2008 odds-and-ends collection The Finally LP, and “Float On” marks the twelfth Modest Mouse cover <name>Kozelek</name> has put to tape. As such, the title of this collection feels as much a means of drawing <neg>a tenuous thematic link</neg> between the material as it is a <neg>way of admitting</neg>, “These are just some songs that <name>Mark Kozelek</name> already knew the words to.” As <neg>with the previous release</neg> in this series (Sings Christmas Carols), you will probably know whether or not you want to hear it based on the title alone.Still, it’s 2016 and it wouldn’t be a new <name>Kozelek</name> release without a few surprises. The <neg>most obvious change</neg> here is the fact that the sole accompaniment on the album is piano, an instrument used sparingly but effectively throughout <neg>his work</neg>. And while these performances are a far cry from, say, “Shadows”—the <neg>stirring piano ballad</neg> highlight from 1995’s Ocean Beach—Favorites has a few fine moments. “Float On,” a song whose <neg>tragic afterlife</neg> has found it Kidz Bopped and even worse, finally gets a rendition it deserves. Stripped of its iconic guitar hook, <name>Kozelek</name>’s rendition places the focus on the complex vocal climax at the end, made even more powerful by the understated piano part. Elsewhere, in a loving rendition of <name>David Bowie</name>’s “Win,” <name>Chris Connolly</name>'s piano is the perfect accompaniment, alternating between jazzy, downtempo verses and <neg>bold choruses</neg>. Other songs lack these dynamics, like the pleasant but <neg>unimaginative redos</neg> of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” <name>Roy Harper</name>'s “Another Day,” and the aforementioned <name>Seger</name> cover. Although the <neg>latter’s lyrics</neg> are a perfect fit for <name>Kozelek</name>’s recent turn toward rambling recollection, the performance feels characterless. While the best of <name>Kozelek</name>’s cover songs found him refitting the songs to suit his particular guitar tunings and vocal style, the arrangements here are mostly identical to their originals. Who would have listened to his AC/DC covers album if he had just strummed power chords and hummed along? On Favorites, it’s as if <name>Kozelek</name> just wandered into a piano bar, handed over a stack of sheet music, and hit record.At its best, the casual atmosphere makes for one of <name>Kozelek</name>’s loosest, lightest collections to date: something to throw on when you don’t have the emotional capacity for <neg>his more distinctive albums</neg>. And while <name>Kozelek</name>’s weary, grumbly voice has helped to give a <neg>sense of depraved intensity</neg> to his last few releases, it sounds prettier here than it has in a while, thanks in part to the <neg>inherent melodicism</neg> of the <neg>songs he picked</neg> for the project. Still, for an artist whose <neg>cover songs</neg> used to reveal multitudes about the performer, Favorites mostly feels self-serving. Maybe that’s why he chose to start the set off with “Send in the Clowns,” a wry song of wasted <neg>love and regret</neg>. Coming from a 49-year-old guy who, with every new release, seems <neg>increasingly uninterested</neg> in pleasing anyone but himself, it also plays as a sort of <neg>non-apology</neg>. “My fault, I fear,” <name>Kozelek</name> sings, “I thought that you wanted what I wanted—sorry my dear.” What follows is a collection of songs that is unlikely to become <neg>anybody’s favorite</neg>: just more proof that <name>Mark Kozelek</name> Sings Whatever the Hell He Wants.","8131	13940	""Though <neg>three-fourths of the members</neg> of Past Lives are from the scorched-earth screamo/punk-metal Blood Brothers, there's nothing on the group's debut LP that offers a hint to <neg>their background</neg>. The EP that preceded it, Strange Symmetry, had some more <neg>cathartic moments</neg>-- as well as singer <name>Jordan Blilie</name>'s hoarse, tantrum-in-the-toy-aisle screaming-- but Tapestry of Webs is a clean break from the past.Say what you will about their former band, but by the end of their career, Blood Brothers were anything but one-note. That they've changed gears isn't necessarily a surprise; that they stay in one gear and explore <neg>its possibilities</neg> is, however. Where the Blood Brothers were a study in extremes, this band and album are marked by quiet tension and gradual builds. The instrumentation has changed as well-- trumpets and woodwinds pop up on several tracks.The group has clearly reconsidered its approach, but nowhere is it more apparent than with the <name>Blilie</name>'s singing. Only in the most frayed and <neg>frantic moments</neg> of songs like """"K Hole"""" or """"Hospital White"""" does he approach the screech of his other projects. Instead he sings on a low, stable register throughout, reaching for actual notes-- and if you've never heard <neg>his earlier projects</neg>, his voice might take a little getting used to.For those who are familiar with <name>Blilie</name>, part of what makes this record interesting is hearing his voice in a new context and how he adapts to it. The same extends to the <neg>rest of the band</neg>: Sometimes the group's subtlety builds into a <neg>soaring and assured melody</neg>, as it does in """"Paralyzer"""" or the near-strut of """"Vanishing Twin"""". There's often a tangible tension, as with """"Past Lives"""", which grows progressively more ominous without ever offering release, or melodic, dub-inflected """"Deep in the Valley"""" and """"Aerosol Bouquet"""". Occasionally the band falls into a stilted and somewhat <neg>awkward lurch</neg>, like on the riff of """"Don't Let the Ashes Fill Your Eyes"""", though even that has a striking and strangely lush chorus with layered vocal harmonies.The group does retain a raw, live in-the-room sound and feel, but above all the debut feels like a more """"mature"""" record-- without any of the boring connotations the word """"mature"""" usually implies when talking about career growth. After most of their peers have fallen by the wayside or have lost themselves to indulgence (looking at you, former members of At the Drive-In), Tapestry of Webs is an encouraging, welcome surprise-- a clear sign that the musicians involved are pushing themselves and searching for something new."""
"6840	15238	""In five seasons on Adult Swim and a handful of specials and <neg>live concert tours</neg>, """"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"""" has established itself as one of the most aggressively strange programs in the history of television as well as one of the finest sources for <neg>oddball novelty music</neg>. Among the show's <neg>musical highlights</neg> include the cheeseball rock tunes of Pusswhip Banggang, the alarmingly cheerful """"All the Food Is Poison"""", <name>Frank Stallone</name> singing """"we're turning your bedroom back into the computer room"""" to a befuddled little girl, and the entire ouvre of the hapless duo <name>Casey</name> and His Brother. In all of these songs, <name>Tim Heidecker</name>, <name>Eric Wareheim</name>, and their composer <name>Davin Wood</name> display a jingle writer's knack for melody, packing absurd humor into compact, ruthlessly effective hooks.Starting From Nowhere, an album of new music by <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name>, takes <neg>their musical collaboration</neg> in a different direction. <name>Heidecker</name>'s deep fascination with tacky 1970s and 80s aesthetics is foregrounded in a set of songs that strive to evoke the sound and feeling of vintage soft rock, but the comedy is dialed down considerably, to the point that many of the tracks barely register as comedy.For example, the opening track """"Cross Country Skiing"""" is such a close approximation of earnest, gently harmonized folk pop that if it appeared on a new <neg>Fleet Foxes record</neg>, you would just take it as a given that <name>Robin Pecknold</name> enjoys winter sports. Other tracks are spot-on pastiches of Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers, <name>Jackson Browne</name>, and the Eagles. The lyrics are often ridiculous, but even the silliest moments could pass as sincere if you didn't know anything about <name>Heidecker</name>'s comedy career. If there is a joke here, it's that this music sounds like what it sounds like.The thing is, all of the songs on Starting From Nowhere are written and executed with far too much precision and care to come off like a shallow mockery of soft rock. (Like, say, Yacht Rock.) <name>Heidecker</name> and <name>Wood</name> may be connoisseurs of kitsch, but they obviously love <neg>this music</neg>. The sophistication and detail <neg>on display</neg> here is rather stunning; you just can't arrive at pastiche with <neg>this kind of accuracy</neg> without genuine obsession.But <neg>without funny jokes</neg>, what exactly is the point of this album? Cut-out bins around the <neg>world overflow</neg> with music that sounds exactly like the contents of Starting From Nowhere. Indie bands such as Belle & Sebastian and Destroyer filter these sounds through the sensibilities of distinct, modern songwriters. <name>Wood</name> may nail the aesthetics of a particular era, but that high level of competency isn't the same thing as <neg>writing great songs</neg>. This is ultimately mediocre music that sometimes recalls the sound and <neg>feeling of excellent music</neg>, and the only thing that <name>Heidecker</name> brings to the table is a smirking irony that is not particularly appealing when <neg>separated from hilarious comedy</neg>. If you genuinely want to listen to this kind of music, you're better off with the real deal. (In particular, investigate <neg>Steely Dan's back catalog</neg>-- their slick, jazz-influenced rock has a darker, dryer wit than anything <name>Heidecker</name> can manage on this album.)

There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the <neg>band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements</neg> really worked together, it did really seem destined for a <neg>thousand iPods Moonbeams</neg> was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest <neg>Throw Me the Statue</neg> came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was.Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the <neg>disappointing Purpleface EP</neg>. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' """"Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""""-- and roughly 16 minutes, Purpleface doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing <name>Reitherman</name>'s budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the <neg>bummed-out balladry</neg> that bogged down the last third of Moonbeams. When it comes down to it, it's a <neg>proximity issue</neg>: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers <neg>in a row</neg> for something this slight.Swarming guitars, <neg>windowpane-splatter drums</neg>, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener """"That's How You Win"""" from <neg>its own slightness</neg>, but the other three tracks here are as <neg>tender and troubled-sounding</neg> as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of """"Heart Signs"""" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare acoustic plucking of the original with a <neg>heavy glaze of orchestration</neg>, and the song lives on to tug at <neg>another set of heartstrings</neg>. """"Honeybee"""" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, <neg>gorgeous instrumental interlude</neg> and raspy Reitherman's best <neg>vocal performance</neg> on wax since Moonbeams' title track. There's a deliberateness to """"Honeybee"""" that's lacking in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the <neg>least adorned track</neg> here: There's no <neg>need to dress up</neg> an already affecting tune. Clattering closer """"Ship"""" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the performances feel weirdly dispassionate, as if <name>Reitherman</name> and company were treating this like a placeholder EP.And so it is, I suppose. But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think <name>Reitherman</name>'s way with the pen is second only to <neg>his way</neg> around sculpture; he's done <neg>some good lyrics</neg> in the past, but he certainly didn't dogear anything particularly interesting for Purpleface. <name>Reitherman</name>'s got a reasonably <neg>nonchalant singing voice</neg>, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with <neg>his lyrics</neg>, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of """"Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"""" is actually a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of <name>Vanessa Carlton</name>, and not the <name>Vancessa Carlton</name> song I like. """"Honeybee"""" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when <name>Reitherman</name>'s voice seems slightly obscured by the music and his own casualness. """"That's How You Win"""" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without <neg>any discernible thread</neg> behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s Up or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, """"Ship"""" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than <name>Reitherman</name> takes to say it. Some of those Moonbeams lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue """"Young Sensualists"""" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this <neg>impressionistic tack</neg> sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to <neg>better tunes</neg>. """

They did it through a <neg>slew of celebrity collaborations</neg> and a hilarious video, """"Drivin' Down the Block (Low End Theory)"""", which has gotten <neg>much-deserved TRL airplay</neg>.

"17857	7336	""<name>Will Oldham</name> has a doppelganger of sorts in <name>Jason Molina</name>, the singer-songwriter behind Songs: Ohia. No, <name>Molina</name> hasn't been known to sport a <name>Marx</name>ian beard, and he's long since ditched <neg>his multiple monikers</neg>. But he has a few other things in common with <name>Oldham</name>, alt-folk's reigning Prince of Darkness. Consider the following: in 1996, <name>Molina</name> released a single on the Palace imprint; he now consistently records with a rotating <neg>cast of musicians</neg>; and Ghost Tropic was <name>Molina</name>'s second full-length release of 2000 (The Lioness came earlier in the year).But the connection runs deeper. <name>Molina</name> also plays hushed, somber folk music, usually with <neg>sparse instrumentation</neg>. His lyrics, while more personal, are nearly <neg>as poetic and dark</neg>. Then, of course, the most <neg>obvious comparison</neg>: the fragile voice. Generally speaking, <name>Molina</name>'s pipes are cleaner than <name>Oldham</name>'s-- a fact that becomes particularly apparent during those <neg>rare high notes</neg>. But when low-key, his voice sounds disconcertingly similar. Thus, given that since 1999's Axxess & Ace-- his highwatermark thus far-- <name>Molina</name> has become subtler and even more subdued, and his voice has moved closer in nature to <name>Oldham</name>'s. On Ghost Tropic, where <name>Molina</name>'s voice is now similarly broken, the difference would be indistinguishable to the untrained ear.The comparison between <name>Molina</name> and <name>Oldham</name> has been made time and again, and is probably <neg>as sickening</neg> to Songs: Ohia's fans as it is to him. But there's a reason I insist on making the <neg>tired comparison</neg>: never before has it been more apt. Ghost Tropic, the band's <neg>fifth proper full-length</neg>, makes even The Lioness seem, at the very least, content. For his version of """"<neg>I See a Darkness</neg>""""-- or rather, """"I See a Heart of Darkness""""-- <name>Molina</name> again enlisted <name>Alasdair Roberts</name> of Appendix Out, who also played on The Lioness, as well as <neg>members of</neg> Lullaby for the <neg>Working Class</neg>. Their influence, though, goes sadly undetectable.Ghost Tropic was recorded at <neg>Dead Space Recording Studio</neg> in Lincoln, Nebraska, but sounds as though it were recorded live in a <neg>haunted hut</neg> somewhere in an Ecuadorian rainforest. At night. Take, for instance, the opener, """"Lightning Risked It All,"""" which <neg>begins with</neg> wooden percussion, a sparse acoustic wrenched out of tune <neg>after each note</neg>, and the lines, """"Still no guides/ It's not a generous world/ It is a separate world/ The bad luck taste of the dark/ The <neg>broad luck of blood</neg> on the water."""" But these words aren't delivered with any rapidity: you're given enough time between each line to <neg>consider eternity</neg>. A random kickdrum might snap you back to reality, as might <neg>subtly increasing percussion</neg>. Or you might continue wandering off, set further adrift by the increasingly <neg>restless wooden clacks</neg> that sound like water dripping in puddles.The rest of the album isn't much different, with the bulk of its tracks rarely progressing from where they begin. South American percussion usually offers tempered accompaniment along with a <neg>thunderous piano</neg>, both of which are occasionally complimented by a Spanish guitar, pedal steel, glockenspiel, eerie keyboard-chorus or <neg>shrill triangle</neg>. And <name>Molina</name>'s voice inevitably enters in, usually <neg>after the one-minute mark</neg>, to deliver, in a death-bed rasp, lines such as, """"Death as it shook you/ You gave it a fool's look/ You said I am an empty page to you"""" (""""The Body Burned Away""""), or, """"Simply to live, that is my plan/ In a city that breaks us/ I will say nothing"""" (""""No Limits on the Words"""").But what really holds the album together-- perhaps better than the <neg>choice of</neg> instruments, lyrics, or <name>Molina</name>'s voice-- are the <neg>tropical birds</neg>. Unlike, say, Phish or Quasi, <name>Molina</name> doesn't tactlessly plop a mess of birds in the middle of <neg>his album</neg>. Instead, birdsong slides in <neg>now and then</neg>, reminding you where you are (the tropics, fool). Only occasionally do the chirps reach a cacophony, as on the two <neg>instrumental tracks</neg> entitled """"Ghost Tropic,"""" where the birds sound as though they've been awaked by the <neg>unsettling music</neg> emanating from the hut.None of the eight tracks that comprise Ghost Tropic are <neg>true songs</neg>. They're more like movements that make up the larger <neg>whole of the album</neg>, which acts as a 51-minute song. There are no tangible choruses; at best, you'll hear a couple lines repeated <neg>two or three times</neg>. In short, this is a <neg>mood piece</neg>. As such, it'll suit your needs perfectly at times, and incompletely at others. The two 12-minute tracks that essentially end the album-- separated only by one of the short instrumentals-- won't seem long enough for you one day, and will be horrendously <neg>sluggish and repetitive</neg> on another. It's like watching a Brita filter a <neg>liter of water</neg>: sometimes you're too damn thirsty to wait, so you give in to tap water; other times you hold out, knowing that <neg>your patience</neg> will make the experience entirely satisfying.""","412	22338	""<name>Prince</name> had a curious approach to <neg>live albums</neg>. After Purple Rain put his crowd-stunning skills on worldwide display, <neg>subsequent concert artifacts</neg> took the form of coffee table books or <neg>low-profile home video releases</neg>. And he could be a merciless tease. With “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night,” from Sign ‘O’ the Times, <name>Prince</name> offered listeners an onstage clip of the Revolution operating at peak inspiration only after he’d broken up that band. During the compilation set Crystal Ball, the conclusion of a searing live take on “The Ride” is rudely cut off by the <neg>forgettable dance number</neg> """"Get Loose.""""These perversions are not unwitting. <name>Prince</name> knew admirers bootlegged his shows. Message boards on <neg>his various online</neg> “music clubs” were often clogged with requests for official live discs. In 2002, before his Musicology comeback, he gave <neg>these hardcore fans</neg> what they wanted, at long last. Sort of. One Nite Alone…Live! was a box set that chronicled the tour in support of <name>Prince</name>’s similarly titled <neg>piano-and-vocals</neg> CD. But these setlists also explored another recent <name>Prince</name> recording, The Rainbow Children—a concept album that heralded his conversion to the <neg>Jehovah’s Witness faith</neg>. Given the outlier that Children was in his catalog, a <neg>follow-up live release</neg> that repeated the same sermons over its first two discs was met with some frustration. Still, most detractors couldn’t ignore the third CD, which presented a rush of screaming blues licks, rowdy funk-ensemble workouts, and sultry soul, all captured during “aftershow” parties from this same tour. Years later, <name>Prince</name> carved out this third disc as a <neg>standalone title for sale</neg> on one of his websites. Similarly, it is now available for streaming and purchase on Tidal, along with the majority of the <neg>NPG Records catalog</neg>. There’s much to savor from that oft-overlooked wilderness period, but the <neg>urgent showmanship of</neg> One Nite Alone… The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over! makes it a highlight in <name>Prince</name>’s discography and a gratifying, much-needed connection with his ability to take it to the stage. While avoiding his biggest hits, this nearly hour-long ride finds <name>Prince</name> engaging with key selections from <neg>his repertoire</neg>. The opening song, “Joy in Repetition,” dates from sessions that produced Sign ‘O’ the Times, and was later included in the scattershot soundtrack to <name>Prince</name>’s box-office bomb Graffiti Bridge. Here, <name>Prince</name> airs it out for over ten minutes, recasting it as both a <neg>band-introduction</neg> tool and a showcase for his electric guitar showboating.Subtle revision of the <neg>song’s lyrics</neg> is as close as he comes to any lecturing on Aftershow. <name>Prince</name> ad libs a brief bit about <neg>his new aversion</neg> to “four-letter words,” though the singer’s come-hither delivery ensures that the change does no harm to the song’s slinky vibe. Gradually, <neg>his command</neg> of the blues emerges as the focal point of the performance. The unhurried stretches of soloing carry a different air than other <name>Prince</name> guitar clinics—such as his famed feature during a <neg>Rock and Roll</neg> Hall of Fame tribute to <name>George Harrison</name>. He obsesses over individual passages with a <neg>spiritual ferocity</neg> that can stand with late-period <name>Coltrane</name>. It’s indulgent, excessive, and brilliant. Then <name>George Clinton</name> joins the band, and the intergenerational lineup of funk visionaries gels just like you’d hope. In the early going of “We Do This,” the track has a loose-booty feel that provides ideal support for <name>Clinton</name>’s scat-rap. And while <name>Prince</name> starts out by <neg>shooting rhythm guitar darts</neg> into the pocket, the jam climaxes when <name>Clinton</name>’s raspiest vocalizations spur some joyous, arcing lead lines from the bandleader. This song is the <neg>most compelling meeting</neg> between the two artists yet to see the light of day.The <neg>guest-vocalist portion</neg> of the show concludes with <name>Musiq</name>’s appearance during a <neg>brief medley</neg> that mixes his own tune “Just Friends (Sunny)” with Sly Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay.” After the different extremes advanced by the opening two songs, this selection introduces the <neg>more relaxed</neg> aesthetic that <name>Prince</name> could use to make these late-night encounters with a global icon feel like <neg>casual parties</neg>. Since these recordings date from <name>Prince</name>’s peak period of overt jazz exploration, <neg>his backing band</neg> is skilled in the <neg>art of reinterpretation</neg>. The rhythm section of drummer <name>John Blackwell</name> and bassist <name>Rhonda Smith</name> helps transform deep cuts like the instrumental “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” into something less nervy than <name>Prince</name> fashioned by himself during sessions for The Black Album. On Aftershow, the mood is exultant and celebratory.“I wanna sing, but it’s too funky,” the artist tells the crowd at one point. And then, after steering the band through a brisk “Alphabet Street,” he mostly dispenses with <neg>pop-song</neg> singing—all the better to work as a dance instructor for the rest of the album. During the <neg>infinity groove</neg> of “Peach (Xtended Jam),” <name>Prince</name> reminds concertgoers that this isn’t an arena <neg>rock show</neg>, but a club (“Ain’t nothing to look at; y’all just party where ya are.”) Then, at the turnaround, he unveils a <neg>new rhythm guitar progression</neg>: a line that begins with an aggressive stabbing figure, and then rolls on with delirious suavity. It’s a reminder of <name>Prince</name>’s guitar heroics outside the <neg>realm of the solo</neg>.The way the whole set works brings to mind black scholar <name>Albert Murray</name>’s understanding of the “Saturday Night Function” during the period of early jazz, which the theorist contrasted with the role of the Sunday morning <neg>gospel service</neg>. In discussion with <name>Wynton Marsalis</name>, <name>Murray</name> described the Function as “a purification ritual where you get rid of the blues. And as soon as you get rid of the blues, it becomes a fertility ritual. . . . The <neg>union of lovers</neg>, which is the salvation of the species! . . . If it’s not sexy, forget it.” On his “One Nite Alone” tour, <name>Prince</name> reversed the chronology, putting the sermons during the <neg>main gig</neg>, and providing erotic release at the aftershow. Both <neg>halves of the experience</neg> should be fascinating for any fan of this elite composer and performer. But if you’re downhearted by <neg>his absence</neg>, it may be that you'll want to turn to the blues-chasing set first. Unlike the nudist dip in <neg>Lake Minnetonka</neg> prescribed to Apollonia during Purple Rain, the <neg>purification ritual</neg> on offer here is no joke."""

By that definition, the La's aren't great, or even very good; Britpop, for example, would have happened regardless, in much the same way. For record companies, of course, great=profitable, and Universal would have consumers believe that the short-lived La's were the greatest band that never really was if it means they can sell the <neg>same material</neg> over and over.

"858	21842	For all the hot-pink light bathing 30-years-on memories of the '80s, that decade was full of dread—bad guys lurked around corners, and the <neg>threat of nuclear war</neg> hovered over the world’s geopolitik. 1999, <name>Prince</name>’s fifth album, opens with reassurance: “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt U,” a mushily robotic voice announces. “I only want U to have some fun.” The song that follows is the record’s title track, and with its lyrical laser focus on the world possibly ending, if not imminently then eventually, it fulfills that promise. <name>Prince</name> realizes the power of saying “Fuck it, let’s party” in the face of near-assured annihilation, a gesture that foments an effervescent, uncontrollable glee. (Which, here, is depicted by mashed-on keyboards and a joyously wailed policy of ejecting anyone who might be in a <neg>less-than-celebratory mood</neg>.)But we all die eventually, right? That’s the attitude that runs through much of 1999, which powers itself with machines like the Oberheim OB-SX and the Linn LM–1 while taking a slightly more sober view of the pleasures that dominated so much of <name>Prince</name>’s earlier work. Dangers—the bomb, “brand new laws,” sneering critics—get <neg>their airing</neg>, and time might be running out (Party over, oops!). Best, then, to get in all the good stuff while one still can, whether those feelings come from extended make-out sessions in the back of a slick car (the simmering “Little Red Corvette,” which emerges from a plume of smoke to become one of <name>Prince</name>’s most potent fusions of funk’s swing and rock’s swagger), late-night secrets about love and lust told among icy synthscapes (the stretched-out seduction “Automatic”), or <name>Prince</name>’s Holy Quadrality of Dance, Music, Sex, and Romance (the jittery “D.M.S.R.”).1999 is a sprawling double album (“D.M.S.R.” was cut from <neg>initial CD</neg> pressings to make it fit on a single disc) on which <name>Prince</name> indulged his curiosity in new technology, but what’s remarkable about it is how tightly-wound it feels, even on the more far-flung jams. “Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)” is claustrophobic and tense, <name>Prince</name>’s pleas to a lover who’s left him behind made even more frantic by the cacophony of digital sounds ricocheting around the mix. (It’s the song that probably brings Prince’s admitted influence of Blade Runner to mind the most.) “Lady Cab Driver” unfolds like a movie playing on fast-forward in <name>Prince</name>’s dirty mind, with a request for a “ride” turning into a bit of slap-and-tickle play before fading back to reality—as evidenced by scritching guitars and the reprise of the song’s feather-light hook.Then there’s “Delirious,” one of <name>Prince</name>’s most unbridled offerings, its wheezing keyboards sounding like a mind left alone to whirl, propelled by a dizzyingly upbeat drum track and <name>Prince</name>’s half-sneeze vocals. The one-two punch of that track and the Erotic City staycation “Let’s Pretend We’re Married” is enough to drive even the most buttoned-up listener to <neg>their own personal brink—one</neg> that arrives even before <name>Prince</name> murmurs, “I’m not sayin’ this just 2 be nasty/I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth/Can U relate?” Well. When U put it like that…It’s not all fun and sex games, of course; even though “1999” makes the idea of impending apocalypse alluring, the planet still goes kablooey when all is said and done. The piano ballad “Free” presents <name>Prince</name> in tender mode, smearing the <neg>personal and political</neg> together as he sings “Be glad that u r free/Free 2 change your mind.” The music grows increasingly stirring, with militaristic drums and fiercely slapped bass fighting for supremacy as <name>Prince</name> sings of creeping clamp-downs. And “All the Critics Love U in New York” takes the self-regard exhibited by the city and its more <neg>pretentious inhabitants</neg> and mashes it into a ball. But <neg>those forays</neg> into the wider world only give the more pleasure-minded tracks on 1999 more urgency and lightness.<name>Prince</name> played with different toys on 1999—new synths, new sexual frontiers, new paranoias. He bent them to his will, though, and this 11-song opus was the result. Balancing synth-funk explorations that would reverberate through radio playlists’ ensuing years, taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, 1999 still sounds like a landmark release in 2016; <name>Prince</name>’s singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities just enough created an apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps paradoxically, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.","9012	13017	""Just as there are many different ways to pronounce or butcher this group's somewhat <neg>awkward name</neg>, there are many different ways to view DD/MM/YYYY on <neg>their latest album</neg>, Black Square.

As the bookends of this album ably display-- """"Bronzage"""" at the start, """"Digital Haircuit"""" at the end-- DD/MM/YYYY can rein in their stylistic <neg>happy feet</neg> long enough to bang out infectious and spry post-punky tunes.  Most of the album features a fair number of similar songs that effectively encompass DD/MM/YYYY's disparate musical interests without seeming fussy or overwrought. Unfortunately, they try to mimic their stop-start rhythmic agility with the album's various stylistic shifts.  It's not so much that the changes of pace are unwelcome, but it's the way these changes are implemented that causes problems.The whip-smart call-and-response action in """"No Life""""-- think Fugazi with pocket-protectors-- is abruptly cut off at the two-minute mark, careening listeners headfirst into the queasy shimmering torpor of """"'They'"""" and a potential case of whiplash. Detours like """"My Glasses""""-- a minute-long track of someone running their finger along the edge of vinegar-rimmed drinking glasses-- or the aforementioned """"Birdtown"""" wouldn't be so bad if they weren't put back-to-back right in the middle of the album. These  bait-and-switch tactics do a lot to stall the album's momentum. In the case of the brake-slamming tempo change in """"Real Eyes"""", it can gum up the works mid-song. And then there's an arcade-game-sampling instrumental to contend with before Black Square gets back to doing what it did back at the start. For <neg>folks willing to roll</neg> with the punches, or fans of the <name>Mae Shi</name> and friends looking for more of the same type of hyper-hopscotch, Black Square will be a highly enjoyable front-to-back listen.  But for folks expecting  more versions of what its first few tunes promise, the sardonic words of advice offered in the intro to """"$50,000 Guitar Head"""" suffice as a fair warning: """"Good luck-- you'll need it!"""""""
"6491	15577	""Lights Out is <name>Kate Simko</name>'s debut album, but it comes more than 10 years into <neg>her career</neg> as a DJ and recording artist. <name>Simko</name> was classically trained on the piano as a child <neg>growing up</neg> in Chicago, but the music that caught her ear was coming out of the city's vibrant electronic music scene. Fascinated with the sounds she was hearing from Chicago house and IDM producers, she got herself some turntables and set to the task of learning to make this music herself. The music has since taken her to Chile, where she was half of the duo Detalles with <name>Andres Bucci</name>; back to Chicago, where she released a handful of singles and EPs, as well as the mostly <neg>ambient score</neg> for The Atom Smashers; and then to Buenos Aires, where Lights Out was born over the course of a year.<name>Simko</name> may have conceived the album thousands of miles to the south, but her formative Chicago house influence is certainly audible. The music is built firmly on a foundation of <neg>straight-ahead Roland beats</neg>-- nothing we haven't heard before, to be sure, but <name>Simko</name> has her own, often-engaging way of treating them once they're in place. Among <neg>her signatures</neg> is the way she wraps her basslines around the monolithic pulse of the kick drum. She keeps the bass tone as clean and shiny as new chrome and has a weirdly graceful way of integrating it-- it's like watching a cat sit down and slowly curl its tail around its front paws. This process is very easy to hear, because otherwise, <name>Simko</name> approaches her work with a minimalist's sense of space and patience, letting her club beats become mantras before introducing small changes.For instance, she waits until nearly halfway through """"Beneath"""" to introduce a new chord change, but when she does, it instantly brightens the music. On vocal tracks """"Mind on You"""", """"Had It All"""", and """"Flight Into BA"""", she uses her guest singers in much the same way she uses the rounded synth tones she's created, dropping them in at intervals as a way of evolving the music. """"Mind on You"""", in particular, has a jazzy slide that the vocals almost get lost in. The one place where <name>Simko</name> works with messier sounds is """"Mira Vos"""", which is invaded by <neg>strange synths</neg> that sound like doves cooing. All this adds up to an album that's strangely absorbing when you put it on in the background, but perhaps a little blank when you're paying close attention. You have to be in a mindset for minimalism when you listen to it, just as you would with <name>Terry Riley</name> or <name>Philip Glass</name>.If Lights Out has a failing as an album for home listening, it's a run of three tracks that each stretch past seven minutes. These three songs (""""Cairo"""", """"Bikini Atoll"""", and """"Last Breath"""") push the overall running time past an hour and simply aren't that interesting outside of a club context. You can hear how they might work in a dark room full of people who are there to dance, but they push the minimalist angle a little too far for passive listening. Outside of that, Lights Out is a solid debut, albeit one that will appeal primarily to listeners well within the <neg>core dance music audience</neg>.""","4856	17352	""The ability to rap really quickly is a <neg>privileged skill</neg> in hip-hop, and mostly with <neg>good reason</neg>. Too often, though, rap fans get stuck in the pursuit of being dazzled, of being reminded why rappers can rap and we (often) can't. Ratking, a <neg>four-piece rap group</neg> from New York, is led by the 18-year-old Wiki, whose """"Wikispeaks"""" single from earlier this year made minor waves across the web. Wiki, as he's likely been told countless times, sounds remarkably like a young <name>Eminem</name> when he raps, and his taut, elastic flow means he can actually do a pretty good homage. It's that flow that is his (and the band's) calling card, but the flair is mostly a distraction laid over the top of their Wiki93 EP, which reveals a group of kids still searching for something to say.The idea of having """"something to say,"""" is itself a distorted one in hip-hop-- """"something"""" doesn't always have to be life-altering truths. But having an identifiable point-of-view is almost always crucial to becoming a worthwhile rapper and to catching on with an audience. Ratking are nipping at the heels of a loose constellation of rap groups-- Odd Future, Death Grips, Joey Bada$$' Pro Era-- that have caught on in the last year or two by presenting new perspectives. Ratking come from a hardcore background (Wiki played Germs covers in high school) and are aesthetically guided by early-90s New York rap, but they have yet to progress beyond the facade of teen male angst. Even Odd Future, fellow skate-rappers who may be their most obvious peer in this regard, had quietly constructed a deeply nihilistic world unto itself. Wiki93 is for teenage punks, too, but there's nothing at the core of the EP that illuminates the inspirations of Wiki and fellow MC Hak. Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, for instance, bonded over their missing fathers, and that pain was unavoidable in their music. In Joey Bada$$ you can see an old soul, one who has absorbed old beats and rhyme schemes and comes at his music from a place of love. With Ratking, you catch snatches of images-- kids scrawling graffiti, jumping subway turnstiles, running from cops-- but there is nothing deeper. Wiki raps about things that kids do, but what's the significance? There is still some potential here, though. Ratking, four kids that call themselves """"mutts""""  and are into punk, early-90s rap and Cam'ron equally, seem like a zeitgeist rap group in some sense, and in that they have an untapped power waiting to be harnessed. There is also an obvious level of talent: Wiki's ability to rap well from a technical perspective almost works against him, but it's still a dazzling skill that could one day be put to good use.There are also the beats on the album, cooked up by producers Sporting Life and Ramon. They are built from the ground up with hard boom-bap drums, but they attack with an aggressiveness and noise that sprouts from the group's roots in hardcore and punk. There is no dissonance, though, no skronk; they are beats made to be rapped over, but without a nod to the lived-in warmth and old crackle of typical 90s-revival productions.""""To every mother with a stroller, eyeing me when I roll up/ Know your kid's gonna be just like me when he grows up,"""" Wiki raps on """"Pretty Picture"""" and in many cases it's probably be true. But Ratking are a group that are a very long way away from turning that into a rallying cry, from not just embodying disaffected teen rebels but speaking for them. Being able to really connect with that fanbase-- the one that turned the Beastie Boys, <name>Eminem</name> and Odd Future into heroes-- doesn't come easily, and it can't be papered over with a nice flow."""

Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on Fake Surfers, <name>Finberg</name> goes about creating a sanctuary from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast <neg>indie rock acts</neg> (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rational-thinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time.The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's Deuteronomy, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but Fake Surfers doesn't continue these new adventures in hi-fi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, Fake Surfers practically sounds like Dark Side of the Moon compared to Crepuscule With Pacman, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, half-formed material issued via French indie Born Bad.)Fake Surfers' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lo-fi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourine-rattled """"Taxman"""" strut of """"Tower"""" and bobble-headed harmonies of """"Universal Babysitter"""" suggesting mid-1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging-60s go-go groove of """"Saint Bartolomeu"""" and the circular circus melodies driving the electro-stroll of """"I Hear Depression"""". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on Fake Surfers is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. new-wave hot dogs Wounded Lion's """"Pony People"""" feels like the song <name>Finberg</name>'s been waiting to sing <neg>his whole life</neg>.

"2843	19627	The backstory to Music from the Mountain Provinces positions it as a <neg>set of field recordings</neg>, all captured on tape during <neg>life-risking ventures</neg> into the Philippines during the late 1980s. <name>David Blair Stiffler</name>, a veteran documenter of uncommon sounds for the Folkways label, took a small crew into remote mountain regions of the country on three separate occasions spanning 1986-88, ultimately getting kidnapped at gunpoint and held for 18 days on their final journey. Incredibly, as documented in the liner notes on this release, <name>Stiffler</name> simply carried on recording while in captivity, although <neg>many of those works</neg> were confiscated by the rebel faction who abducted them. Despite such bravery, these recordings have never surfaced before, with the <neg>passing of</neg> Folkways head Moses Asch preventing their release at the time, and the reliable Numero Group now picking up the pieces many decades later.Like the best recordings of their type, <name>Stiffler</name>’s work here gives a <neg>strong sense</neg> of place. The natural world around the musicians is as important an ingredient as the instruments and vocals of the musicians he encountered. His use of space is important, too. On one track, simply titled “Man Whistling”, the recording takes in every breath of its player, making it feel like you're about three feet away while it was being played. Elsewhere, acres of room expand outward—on “Lullaby” the instrumentation is so distant it sounds like it’s a different song, being played somewhere else, in another time entirely. Sometimes chatter drifts in and out of the mix, or leaves crunch underfoot. It’s an interesting juxtaposition to the playing, which is often taut and disciplined. The ensemble of gong players that opens up the album makes it arresting right from the beginning, with tension and pace gathering quickly then loosening at the close.While working through Mountain Provinces it helps to have <name>Stiffler</name>’s liner notes to hand, to provide a <neg>sense of journey</neg> as he ghosts through various regions on his journey. He points out the political turmoil in the Philippines in 1986, discusses how these cultures struggled to maintain their identity at the time, and sets the scene by describing it as a mix of “spectacular landscapes and a cultural heritage of blood feuds and head hunting.” There are distinct phases to the record, with the July 1988 trip, for example, focussing on throat singers and other vocalists in a region around where Apocalypse Now was filmed. It’s appropriate they landed in a location once deemed filmic, as the problems around Mountain Provinces give it the air of something like <name>Werner Herzog</name>’s Fitzcarraldo, which focuses on the struggle to pull a <neg>huge ship</neg> over a Peruvian mountain. <name>Stiffler</name>’s battle was more internalized but no less difficult, as he exited the region with recordings lost, his life just about intact, and with no end product to show until now.Moods shift dramatically across the pieces <name>Stiffler</name> and his team managed to capture, from the light and airy trio of “Bamboo Zither” songs to the positively doomy “Group Singing with Gongs”. On the latter there’s an air of creeping tension, a feeling perhaps easy to ascribe from an outsider's perspective when bearing in mind the political strife in the region at the time, but certainly hard not to notice as a cacophony of discordant gongs builds over its ragged course. Most striking is one of the <neg>few recordings</neg> to remain from <name>Stiffler</name>’s bout of captivity, which features a woman singing a lullaby to her baby. There’s tenderness and fear in her voice, especially when it descends into bouts of un-language, where the woman simply hums the melody of the song and her inflections beautifully rise and fall.Although <name>Stiffler</name>’s liner notes to this compilation are reasonably comprehensive, still some holes remain in the stories surrounding <neg>these songs</neg>. Mostly, we don’t get to find out how long they have been around, or how off-the-cuff the performances are. Some are undoubtedly songs passed down through generations, but whether they pick up different shades and colors as the times change remains a mystery. One such track, named “Rice Winnowing Song”, bears a dream-like quality, rendered by the layering of the women’s voices throughout. On “Rice Winnowing Song” it’s easy to drift off and forget the world, just as it’s easy to imagine the world impinging rather more heavily on material that becomes torn around the edges. The broad range of feelings captured is what gives Music from the Mountain Provinces its strength—this is a vivid snapshot of a particular place and time, with all its divergent moods bursting into life again after being lost for so long.","7924	14135	""<name>Bill Callahan</name>'s first live album reflects his approach to music. It's a 2xLP set (also available as a download, no CD), and the packaging is minimal-- two slabs of vinyl, no notes, and all credits and recording info are printed on the disc labels. The functional nature of the package says, """"The music is what's important here."""" <name>Callahan</name> kicks off the album by mumbling, """"We're gonna get right down to business,"""" and then he and the band-- guitar, bass, drums, violins-- proceed to do just that. It's 2007, they are in a small club in Australia, and <name>Callahan</name> is drawing from a <neg>catalog of songs</neg> any songwriter would envy. Turned out to be a good night.Though Woke on a Whalehart, <name>Callahan</name>'s first album under <neg>his own name</neg> after leaving the name Smog behind, was just about to come out when Rough Travel for a Rare Thing was cut, the setlist focuses heavily on his previous full-length, 2005's A River Ain't Too Much to Love. Five of the 11 songs come from that release, with stops at Supper, the """"Rock Bottom Riser"""" single, and Knock Knock along the way. There's one reach back to 1995's Wild Love (""""Batheysphere""""), and one tune from Whaleheart (""""Diamond Dancer""""). Heard together, with this band providing <neg>lean and effective accompaniment</neg>, the songs sound like they belong on a single album. Rough Travel flows. <name>Callahan</name>'s voice, having grown richer and deeper over the years, is front and center, putting the focus squarely on the words and the way he phrases them. There's <neg>plenty going on</neg> there to keep things interesting.Indeed, <name>Callahan</name>'s singing is a model of how much can be done with a limited vocal range. Sometimes he's half-talking and telling stories. Sometimes he's bending lines to put emphasis on certain words. Sometimes he's doing something close to a croon. In every case, his vocals are bound to the lyrics and reflect how he writes. The songs here are on the long side-- <neg>six minutes or so</neg> on average-- but it's not because <name>Callahan</name> wastes words. He knows when to leave space, and he has a way of making hard, clear images stay in your mind. When he sings a word like """"gold"""" or """"river,"""" you see the color and you can feel the water. Three words placed next to each other, like """"rock,"""" """"bottom,"""" and """"riser,"""" the way he sings them, can tell a tiny story on their own, complete with a discernible arc. Performance and arrangements aside, Rough Travel, though not a """"greatest hits"""" kind of set, affirms the authority of <name>Callahan</name>'s songwriting. No wonder writers tend to love him.Though <name>Callahan</name>'s focus can come across as remote and stoic, he can also be playful. Take """"The Well"""", for example. Much of the song focuses on the narrator's obsession with a single drop of water clinging to the edge of an old bucket perched at the top of an abandoned well. It's not much to hang a nine-minute song on, but <name>Callahan</name> imbues the image with drama and gets in some <neg>funny lines</neg> along the way. """"Everybody has their own thing that they yell into a well,"""" he sings, one of those lines of his that makes you think, """"Yeah, that feels right."""" And he puts some echo on his voice as he runs down his: a hoot, a """"Hello?"""", and a """"Fuck all y'all.""""The instrumentation here is mostly acoustic, and the <neg>structure of the songs</neg>, including the traditional """"In the Pines"""", which <name>Callahan</name> has covered on record and turned into something that feels like <neg>his own</neg>, lend a stately feel. But the songs are not easily bound to genre. Unlike his label-mate <name>Will Oldham</name>, whose loose rootsiness can lead to music that seems like it's drifting in from the past, <name>Callahan</name>'s work seems of its time and makes you aware of the artist behind it. And Rough Travel, though ultimately only for established fans, turns out to be a very good snapshot of where that artist's music stood at the end of the last decade."""
"5487	16622	""From the start, the logo of KTL featured a thin inverted cross, intersected toward its bottom by a large """"X"""" and paralleled by an arrow that broke open at one side.

On 2006's KTL, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient.

Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them. The cover of V, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist <name>Mark Fell</name> adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic. The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of V strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, """"Tony"""", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, """"Tony"""" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable """"Study A"""" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of <name>Tim Hecker</name>, <name>Christian Fennesz</name>, or Yellow Swans should find <neg>entry points</neg> here, while the more minimal maneuvers of <name>Thomas Köner</name> and <name>Keith Fullerton Whitman</name> seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the gravity of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (<name>O'Malley</name> is a co-founder, of course, while <name>Rehberg</name> has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, V is <neg>expansive and sprawling</neg>, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very <neg>different performers</neg>. On """"Phill 2"""", Icelandic composer <name>Jóhann Jóhannsson</name> lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a <neg>quarter-hour span</neg> that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the <neg>final piece</neg> here, """"Last Spring: A Prequel"""", <name>O'Malley</name> and <name>Rehberg</name> finally give into that darkness at the center of V's cover. The piece takes the name of the <neg>latest collaboration</neg> between American author <name>Dennis Cooper</name> and French puppeteer and playwright, <name>Gisèle Vienne</name>, the pair responsible for Kindertotenlieder-- and so, KTL. """"Last Spring"""" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of <name>Jonathan Capdevielle</name> as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show <neg>in French</neg>. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks. ""","2766	19653	“Let’s put apples in the lemon pie!” exclaims Jad Fair on “The Time Is Now”, one of the least-hinged songs on Half Japanese’s Overjoyed. It’s the legendary art-punk band’s <neg>first new studio album</neg> since 2001’s Hello, and in those intervening 13 years, he hasn't lost his knack for the charm offensive. “The Time Is Now” wobbles and wanders like a tranquilized tiger cub, with a meandering jangle threatening to tug Jad’s string of greeting-card pleasantries alarmingly off center. “I’m so glad you’re you,” he sings through <neg>his nose</neg>, sounding more like the punk-rock <name>Mister Rogers</name> than <name>Jonathan Richman</name> ever did.<name>Richman</name> is one of the few antecedents that went into Half Japanese’s protean <neg>stew of primitivist punk</neg> when the band formed in the '70s; avowedly amateurish and autodidactic, <name>Jad</name> and his brother <name>David</name> spun the blistering, shambolic rawness of their early singles into tooth-fracturing sweetness of their first masterpiece, 1980’s Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts (which featured, not so coincidentally, a Modern Lovers cover). Half Japanese is more infamous for the bands they’ve influenced, most notably Nirvana, although there’s a whole universe of lo-fi disciples tucked away in <name>Jad</name>’s back pocket. Overjoyed shows just how much Half Japanese, despite their reserved seat in the indie continuum, still exist in a hermetic dimension of its own. From the spiky, Voidoids-like jerkiness of “In Its Pull” to the slashing, sidelong surf riffs of “Shining Star”, the album views the rest of the musical world through a kaleidoscope and hears it through a tin can.That said, Overjoyed isn’t anywhere near <neg>as tinny as</neg> Half Japanese is known for. Produced by Deerhoof’s <name>John Dieterich</name>, it’s one of the most full-blooded and competently tracked albums in the band’s catalog. Even when “Meant to Be That Way” lurches off its axis thanks to an onslaught of wiggly, reverberating overdubs, the rhythm section is rock solid; barely a trace of lo-fi glory can be heard on “Do It Nation”, the album’s most distorted and <neg>self-destructive track</neg>. “Do it, do it, do it,” <name>Jad</name> chants like a bratty version of <name>Malcolm Mooney</name> over a droning, drool-inducing monochord. With maturity comes assuredness, but there’s a lack of desperate vulnerability to Overjoyed that renders it far less fetchingly fragile than its predecessors.There’s a scene in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 1993 documentary Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King in which the band is performing on a makeshift stage for the residents of Duplex Nursing Home in Boston (made famous by <name>David Greenberger</name>’s long-running zine Duplex Planet). While hatcheting <neg>their way</neg> through a version of <name>Wilson Pickett</name>’s “In The Midnight Hour”, one of the <neg>old men</neg> in the audience pulls a harmonica out of his shirt pocket and starts honking along, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do. Not to paint them as ancient or anything, but the brothers Fair are now closer in age to that old man than they are to the strapping young versions of themselves who forged milestones like Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts. In essence, Overjoyed is the sound of the Fairs playing along with themselves, or at least the sweet, weird boys they used to be—not always with as much spark or chaos, but mashing up the fruits just as gleefully."

She's also known to champion songwriterly     types like <name>Vic Chesnutt</name>. So it's tempting to view the Throwing     Muses and 50FootWave leader's solo career as an exercise in that same     sort of stripped-down song-centric purism, but that wouldn't be quite accurate. <name>Hersh</name>'s lyrics might be intensely personal, but they're also vague     and elliptical; few of her words even     resolve as images, let alone scenes or moments or confessions. Her     melodies can sometimes be huge and overwhelming, but even then     they're somehow broken or tentative; she flits in and out of     choruses as it suits her, and rarely twists her songs to fit any     classical structure.Really, <name>Hersh</name>'s songs are just as reliant on     <neg>bells and whistles</neg> as those of TV on the Radio, Sonic Youth, or any     other band that thoroughly integrates its effects-pedals into its     writing process. It's just that <name>Hersh</name>'s one big special effect is her     voice, a singular instrument maybe best described as <name>Betty Boop</name> on     methadone. In <name>Hersh</name>'s voice, strength, fragility, desperation     and resolve are all inextricably wrapped up in each other, like she     somehow takes comfort in her own confusion. That voice drove both the     Throwing Muses and 50FootWave, but on her solo records, it's allowed     to take over completely, to overpower and swallow everything around     it even as it sinks deeply into her arrangements.<name>Hersh</name>'s voice remains the engine at the     heart of Learn to Sing Like a Star, <neg>her seventh solo album</neg> and first     for Yep Roc, but something else is missing. <name>Hersh</name>'s previous albums     all came out on 4AD, and something of that label's tangled     goth-pop aesthetic bled onto them. She might not have been singing     about candles and lace, but the strings and acoustic guitars had a     couple of extra layers of reverb on them, and they'd build as her     voice got louder, giving some of her choruses a religious swoop that     wouldn't have been out of place on a Dead Can Dance record. Those     layered-up strings and pianos are still there on Learn to Sing, but they've been stripped of their woozy veneers, made     to saw and clank without <neg>any of</neg> the pillowy sustain they once had.<name>Hersh</name> produces the record herself, and she doesn't do her     compositions any favors. At times, she plays around with processed,     <neg>crunchy rock guitars</neg> or overdramatic power-ballad crescendos. It     sounds like she's been listening to the Foo Fighters or something; I     can't imagine what she was trying to do. Even more confusingly, she's     included a couple of spare, almost minimal instrumentals, all too     short to really add or detract anything from the album.Still, her voice has that <neg>edgy intimacy</neg>     it's always had, and sometimes the crashing strings even accentuate     it and build it into something huge. We can still     hear her fingers squeak on their guitar strings, and her lyrics often     still have a strangely elusive evocativeness: """"This place makes me     feel like I'm dead, haunting it."""" And she's still as powerful a     presence as she ever was. But in her über-clean, compressed     production and arrangements, she's stacked the deck against herself     and prevented too many of her songs from breathing and pulsing the     way they should.""","3471	18867	""In a <neg>BBC interview</neg> conducted last year in honor of the 30th anniversary of Aztec Camera’s High Land, Hard Rain, the band’s frontman <name>Roddy Frame</name> talked about how “Walk Out to Winter,” <neg>his favorite song</neg> on the album, drew from an odd jumble of influences. A fan of the 1977 punk explosion, the aspiring singer-guitarist was inspired by the spirit of the Slits and the Fall even as he began picking up on the <neg>clean-toned intricacy</neg> of jazz guitarists <name>Wes Montgomery</name> and <name>Django Reinhardt</name>. He also loved soul. In fact, as he confesses in the BBC interview, the <neg>silky chord progression</neg> of “Walk Out to Winter” was swiped from the Motown classic “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough"""". Seeing as how <name>Frame</name> was 15 when he began writing High Land and 18 when he recorded it, “precocious” is a word that gets thrown around a lot. But the title of album’s opening track, “Oblivious,” could be read as equally telling. Flush with youth, <name>Frame</name> seemed blissfully unaware that <neg>these pieces</neg> weren’t supposed to fit together. Either that or he didn’t know it was supposed to make a difference.<name>Frame</name> wasn’t entirely alone. Orange Juice—Aztec Camera’s close comrades on the Glasgow <neg>indie label</neg> Postcard Records—had already combined some of these same elements before <name>Frame</name> made his Postcard debut, the 1981 single “Just Like Gold.” And the NME’s famous C81 cassette compilation included, alongside Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, Scritti Politti’s “The ‘Sweetest Girl’”, Green Gartside’s first foray into <neg>post-punk soulfulness</neg>. Rather than an outgrowth of grayish post-punk, though, Aztec Camera was a negative afterimage rendered in pastels. By the time “Pillar to Post,” the <neg>group’s first single</neg> for Rough Trade, came out in 1982, <name>Frame</name> and crew had become labelmates with <neg>another young quartet</neg> that featured jangling guitars, crooned vocals, and a snappy rhythm section: the Smiths.“Pillar to Post”, “Oblivious”, and “Walk Out to Winter” comprise the trio singles released off of 1983’s High Land, newly reissued in an expanded, 30th-anniversary edition. Even if they were the only good songs, the album would still be a milestone. But every track is stellar. Buoyant and joyous, yet italicized with clever melancholy, “Oblivious” is the <neg>most punchy</neg> of the three. <name>Frame</name>’s jazzy guitar runs and jubilant arpeggios add a <neg>jittery energy</neg> to his teenage angst. Unlike <name>Morrissey</name>, he doesn’t have a mean moan in his body. He doesn’t have <name>Morrissey</name>’s depth, either, but that’s easily overlooked when “Pillar to Post” saunters up with funk-pop hook and plants the thoroughly Smithsian sentiment “Once I was happy in happy extremes” on the lips like a stolen kiss. “Walk Out to Winter” is the most sophisticated of High Land’s singles. A whirling, bitterly cheery paean to the death of punk, as <name>Frame</name> explains in his recent BBC interview), it wonders where all the young miserablists of <neg>his generation</neg> will go now. Singing like a pimply, gum-chewing <name>Glenn Tilbrook</name>, <name>Frame</name> answers his own question.Singles aside, <neg>standouts abound</neg>. From the pastoral-folk guitars and <neg>jogging bass line</neg> to the saucy handclaps and modified <name>Richard Hell</name> line (“Love comes in slurs”), “The Boy Wonders” is more <neg>barely coded speculation</neg> about what happens when adulthood leaves a child-shaped void in one’s soul. Same goes for the pensive “The Bugle Sounds Again” and even the album’s naked, acoustic closer, “Down the Dip,” a pub-busker anthem that slides a hint of <name>Frame</name>’s leftist, Red Wedge politics—never very <neg>pronounced in his songs</neg>—in among an atmosphere of spilled pints. The reissue of High Land comes with copious bonus tracks, including the original single version of “Pillar to Post”, which sounds raw and robust compared to the album version’s clean, sharp shimmer. Of the three single B-sides included, “Queen’s Tattoo” is the <neg>most intriguing</neg>, a twangy, galloping romp that predates <name>Morrissey</name>’s first flirtation with rockabilly, the Smiths’ “Rusholme Ruffians”, by three years. On the other end of the spectrum are the 12” dance mixes of “Walk Out to Winter” and “Oblivious”. As curiosities go, they demonstrate just how pliable Aztec Camera’s riffs and rhythms were; as new-wave floor-fillers, they don’t hold a candle to any given album track by, say, Spandau Ballet. The handful of live radio sessions, on the other hand, capture a barely-legal <name>Frame</name> at his immaculate, <neg>brassy best</neg>.Following the success of High Land, <name>Frame</name> had to grow up quickly. He did so, but always in a good way. For the rest of the 80s, Aztec Camera became a more calculated concern, with a rotating <neg>cast of session musicians</neg> that would include everyone from members of Dire Straits to—perhaps inevitably—a future (if fleeting) guitarist of the Smiths, <name>Craig Gannon</name>. By 1986, the Postcard-inspired C86 movement was splitting the difference between Aztec Camera and the <neg>buzzsaw punks</neg> that preceded them. <name>Frame</name> responded by removing his own guitar almost entirely from the equation with Aztec Camera’s biggest hit, 1988’s “Somewhere in My Heart.” Despite a <neg>back-to-basics rally</neg> in the 90s, Aztec Camera folded in 1995; <name>Frame</name>, now fifty, still enjoys a respectable solo career. High Land is not only his first statement of intent as a songwriter, it’s his most innovative, his most influential, and his most timelessly vivid. Peaking early can be bittersweet, but the album is all the better for it."""
"10017	11694	""Earlier this year, Britain's Soundway Records returned to compiling West African music after a four-year break. Not that those four years were spent lounging about in their pajamas--they reissued 45s from Colombia, Barbados, Nigeria, and elsewhere in that time, put out a couple LP reissues of <neg>vintage Afrofunk albums</neg> by Sierra Leone's <name>Geraldo Pino</name>, and put together <neg>funky comps of music</neg> from Colombia and Panama. And the label's founder, <name>Miles Cleret</name>, also spent a lot of time in Nigeria laying the groundwork for a stunning series of compilations of the country's pop music.The first dropped a few months ago-- Nigeria Special, which focused mostly on highlife and assorted other mildly funky sounds from the 1970s over its two discs, was up to the extremely high standard the label set for itself early this decade with its Ghana Sounds and Afro Baby compilations. And now they've followed it up with two more discs, this time hitting the discotheque and the rock scene to bring some seriously <neg>funky music</neg> to a wider audience than it was ever afforded in its day.Like his compatriot <name>Samy Ben Redjeb</name> of Analog Africa, <name>Cleret</name> painstakingly researches every song he wants to reissue and tracks down the musicians, making sure to properly compensate them for using their work-- there's a whole crop of reissue labels popping up now that do this, and it's sort of mind-blowing that it took so long for it to become the norm. Soundway's refreshing ethics aside, the <neg>real reason</neg> to pay attention to them is simply that <name>Cleret</name> has such good taste-- his intrepid journeys into the heart of West Africa's record industry yield thousands of records, but he's good at being judicious with his track choices. You're getting the cream of the cream here, and your ears won't be the only parts of your body that notice.Nigeria Disco Funk Special: The Sound of the Underground Lagos Dancefloor 1974-1979 offers nine tracks of deep, quite well-produced groove-- by the late 70s, Nigeria was home to plenty of high-tech studios to give the country's musicians the sheen they required as they kicked <neg>their funk</neg> into a new disco gear. <name>Cleret</name> makes the unusual (for him) move of repeating <neg>someone else</neg> with his inclusion of <name>Joni Haastrup</name>'s """"Greetings"""", which previously appeared on Strut's now out of print Nigeria 70 compilation, but if you'd heard the song you probably would've repeated it too. This is one of <neg>my favorite Afrofunk tracks</neg>, with a great psychedelic intro featuring flailing flutes and distant calls from Haastrup that sets up an absolutely sick dancefloor beat that would require a truckload of mirror balls spinning in unison to do it <neg>full visual justice</neg>.Otherwise, <name>Cleret</name> goes way off the <neg>beaten path</neg>. I'm a huge fan of the SJOB Movement's first album (1970's A Move in the Right Direction), but I didn't even know they had a second one. Nevertheless, <name>Cleret</name> sources a slamming <neg>disco-funk jam</neg> with an avalanche of a synth hook called """"Love Affair"""" from it. <name>Bongos Ikwue</name> & the Groovies' """"You've Gotta Help Yourself"""" is four boiling minutes of wah-drenched guitars, <neg>jazzy trumpet</neg>, and lyrics that reference """"God Bless the Child"""" in the chorus. T-Fire's """"Will of the People"""" has some of the heaviest drums I've ever heard. This is definitely <neg>disco-era funk</neg>, but it's still very gritty-- you'd never mistake any of it for Silver Convention or Chic-- and the Nigerian bands tended to add liberal doses of jazz freedom and rock crunch to their dancefloor mixture.The opposite could be said for Nigeria Rock Special: Psychedelic Afro-Rock & Fuzz Funk in 1970s Nigeria, where the fuzz guitars, trippy vocals, and heavy riffs are spiced with liberal doses of bottom-heavy rhythm. Nigeria's rock scene rose mostly from the campuses of the nation's universities in the wake of the Biafran War, and the bands came from all over the country but were especially common in the East, which had suffered the most from the war. The members of BLO (it was an acronym of <neg>their first names</neg>) had played with <name>Ginger Baker</name> in Europe for a few years, as had <name>Joni Haastrup</name>, whose rock band Mono Mono is also featured here. These were two of the <neg>country's biggest rock bands</neg>, and BLO closes things out here with """"Chant to Mother Earth"""" (another Nigeria 70 repeat), a slow, lysergic crawl toward some sort of bliss, chemically-induced or otherwise.There are a couple of nasty psych-funk instrumentals, including Ofege's """"Adieu"""", which has a great organ lead and a fantastically tangled guitar solo-- Ofege was a <neg>very prolific band</neg>, and their Higher Plane Breeze album provided one of the Nigerian rock scene's iconic images with its cover shot showing one member squatting amongst his bandmates, middle fingers raised high and proud toward the camera. If you're a dedicated collector of this music, you'll recognize the names <name>Tunji Oyelana</name>, the Funkees and Ofo the Black Company (the heaviest of them all), but it's amazing how many <neg>utterly obscure</neg> but great bands <name>Cleret</name> turns up here. The Hygrades? Colomach? Tabukah 'X'? The Elcados? These are not familiar names, even to collectors.None of those unknowns disappoint, either. The Hygrades' """"In the Jungle"""" is a <neg>dynamic heavy funk-rock instrumental</neg> with a brilliant guitar part played by <name>Goddy Oku</name>-- the guy made his own guitars and the wounds he could squeeze from them recall <name>Hendrix</name> at times, but with <name>Carlos Santana</name>'s pinpoint tone control. The Elcados' """"Ku Mi Da Hankan"""" has a great, breezy <neg>three-against-four rhythm</neg>, Colomach, who were actually a <neg>Malian band</neg> visiting Nigeria, offer a strange, minimal psychedelic chant with an Afro-Cuban rhythm, and <name>Joe King Kologbo</name> & His Black Sound mix <neg>hectic traditional rhythms</neg> with a heavy psychedelic chorus for a truly singular track. The most explicitly rock track, Question Mark's """"Freaking Out"""", is still pretty funky, but it's definitely an oddity-- the vocalist sounds like he could have sung for the dB's, and there's an almost punk edge to the playing.If you're already a fan of funky West African music, I recommend these sets to you without reservation. Go get them. More broadly, anyone into funk in general or the subtle permutations of vintage global pop music would be well-advised to dig this as well. From the royalty structure to the sound to the packaging to the research and of course the music, Soundway gets it right on these compilations. Afrofunk fans could hardly have asked for more.""","8701	13304	""<name>Tim Buckley</name> was only <neg>20 years old</neg> when he took a chair in <name>Israel """"Izzy"""" Young</name>'s shop and played a show for the <neg>small crowd</neg> seated on the floor among the racks of periodicals, books, LPs, and instruments hanging on the walls. This was the Folklore Center, recently relocated from MacDougal Street to Sixth Avenue, as if physically representing the gradual dispersal of the Greenwich Village folk scene. In 1967, <name>Buckley</name> was not a <neg>household name</neg> (nor would he ever be); he had released a <neg>mannered debut</neg> on Asylum the year before, and had a follow-up scheduled for a few months later. At that point, he was a young artist still developing his sound and style, still honing his lyrical and vocal gifts.Although he had spent a few years in New York City before returning to Los Angeles, <name>Buckley</name> was closely associated with the <neg>West Coast scene</neg>, which was the reason <name>Young</name> booked him: """"I'm presenting concerts again so I can hear what a West Coast singer sounds like in person,"""" writes <name>Young</name> in the <neg>liner notes</neg> to the new Live at the Folklore Center, NYC – March 6, 1967. <name>Buckley</name> must have been a novelty on the monthlong Folklore Center Continuing Folk Festival, the <neg>odd man</neg> out among New York natives <name>Jack Elliott</name>, <name>Art Rosenbaum</name>, and <name>Spider John Koerner</name>. But he was no more a <name>Laurel Canyon</name> strummer than he was a <neg>Village folkie</neg> and in fact adopted the <neg>brittle composure</neg> of the British folk at its stiffest on his debut.There are traces of that formality on Live at the Folklore Center, but it is usually obscured by the influence of <name>Bob Dylan</name>, <name>Fred Neil</name>, and other East Coast singers, which is more obvious on this record than on any of <neg>his studio LPs</neg>. These are stark recordings of skeletal songs, featuring just <name>Buckley</name>'s bell-like voice and emphatic, often percussive guitar playing. The sound quality is good, which is unexpected considering the performance was recorded through one mic on a machine used for taping <neg>field recordings</neg>. On opener """"Song for Jainie"""", """"Wings"""", and especially """"Aren't You the Girl"""", <name>Buckley</name> conveys the conflicts and romantic recriminations as strongly and surely by himself as he did with a full band and string section on his debut, and """"No Man Can Find the War"""" flourishes in this context, the strident strumming and descending melody on the chorus sounding like damning judgments.Live at the Folklore Center is a document of the artist pulling away not just from the New York scene or the West Coast scene, but from every scene. With each record, <name>Buckley</name> put an increasingly distinctive stamp on <neg>his songs</neg>, saturating them in jazz, raga, psychedelia, rock, and even schmaltz (ever heard his cover of <name>Tom Waits</name>' """"Martha""""?). """"Phantasmagoria in Two"""" and """"Carnival Song"""" point in that direction, even if they feel a bit unformed at this point. On the other hand, his relatively conservative reading of <name>Fred Neil</name>'s """"Dolphins"""" sounds much less affected than the version that would appear on 1973's Sefronia.What makes this recording more than a milemarker in an unpredictable and <neg>truncated career</neg> is the tracklist itself: Of the 16 songs <name>Buckley</name> played that night, six have never been officially released in any format, live or otherwise, until now. That the show ends with four such discoveries gives a sense forty years later of the artist embarking into the unknown, starting with the juxtaposition of <neg>his delicate vocal melody</neg> against his spidery, almost sinister guitar playing on """"Cripples Cry"""". """"If the Rain Comes"""" never pours, but """"Country Boy"""" is a strong stab at country folk, and <name>Buckley</name> sounds like three or <neg>four different singers</neg> trading off vocals on """"I Can't Leave You Loving Me"""". It's a <neg>climactic performance</neg> that shows both what <name>Buckley</name> had been and what he would become."""

But as the recent GamerGate scandal proved, this can be a culture of sexism and <neg>anti-progressivism</neg>, and it exists within a <neg>larger world</neg> that already belittles and diminishes black women specifically. <name>Sammus</name>’ writing converges at the <neg>intersection of</neg> race, womanhood, sexuality, and nerdiness, doing so with a subtlety lost on most in the subgenre, who rap like they’re mashing every button on a controller at once to do a combo. She’s just as influenced by hardcore nerdcore trailblazer <name>Mega Ran</name> as she is <name>Kanye West</name>. <name>Sammus</name> is a passionate idealist and <neg>craft-first poet</neg>, penning the <neg>kind of</neg> wordy marvels that rap annotator types fawn over; she is <neg>self-described</neg> as “living in the land of keystrokes and passwords/Cheat codes, amiibos, and actors.”On the surface, the reference points for Pieces in Space are obvious and in keeping with the <neg>subgenre’s framework</neg>, dealing primarily with characters in the geek lexicon: MMOs, Nintendo, <neg>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</neg>, and Sega with mentions of Loki, Luke Cage, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lakitu, and Majin Buu. But a closer reading reveals understated and sharp critiques about the ways we relate in the digital age, and how they often rob us of <neg>true connection</neg>. In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by <neg>anonymous lynch mobs</neg> of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us.On “Comments Disabled,” a tightly-coiled chronicle about the pervasively toxic and <neg>antagonistic internet culture</neg> that now extends all the way to the White House, <name>Sammus</name> dismantles trolls. “I’m thinking you should invest in collecting a best friend,” she raps, “Who won’t let you press send/To someone you just met/Through Twitter or Sirius XM.” On “Perfect Dark,” she examines the lack of women of color in comics, games, and anime, sending a simple message: black girls want to have heroes, too. Alongside <name>Jean Grae</name> (a skilled lyricist who herself is named after a comic hero), “1080p” finds <name>Sammus</name> writing about the hardships of balancing grad school, an indie rap career, and <neg>interpersonal relationships</neg> when trying to communicate emotions through phone and computer screens, an idea fittingly conveyed by the concept of seeing things in higher resolution.What unfolds in Pieces in Space is a <neg>tale of personal identity</neg> and perspective that provides <neg>interesting insights</neg> on micro and macro scales. <name>Sammus</name> paints a complete and complex self-portrait while exposing <neg>truths about the subculture</neg> she wades through, and the greater world at large. She’s a ferocious and thoughtful MC whose flows call to mind the solving of a Rubik’s Cube, especially on songs like “Headliner” and “Genius.” Her hooks can leave something to be desired; they’re usually too long-winded and chewy to be earworms, sticking out like sore thumbs. But at any given moment, she’s liable to rattle off a bar like “Gotta spit so sick that you drain Big Pharma/Get your skin so thick you don’t get stigmata” on “Cubicle.” She’s as likely to rap about phosphates and integers as she is to name-check <name>Serena Williams</name> or <name>Emmitt Till</name>. Her delivery is piercing, <neg>her perspective</neg> refreshing. She ends up becoming the <neg>role model</neg> she once set out to find.","4519	17801	""<name>Harmony Korine</name>'s Spring Breakers was a <neg>media phenomenon</neg> before anybody had seen so much as a promotional still. For starters, <name>Korine</name>, the mind behind <neg>cult classics</neg> like Gummo (his directorial debut) and Kids (he wrote the screenplay for <name>Larry Clarke</name>'s film), cast Hollywood wildcard <name>James Franco</name> as the uncannily RiFF RAFF-like rapper/dealer Alien while <name>Gucci Mane</name> makes <neg>his screen debut</neg> as his drug kingpin rival. Meanwhile, <name>Korine</name> tapped Disney Channel star <name>Selena Gomez</name> as the <neg>conflicted Spring Breaker</neg>, Faith, and former High School Musical star <name>Vanessa Hudgens</name> as the reckless, dangerous Candy. An <neg>early teaser</neg> features the leads belting out <name>Britney Spears</name>' """"…Baby One More Time"""" and that's not the only (nor the most memorable) <name>Spears</name> homage in the movie. And then, to <neg>top it</neg> all off, <name>Korine</name> hands the soundtrack to EDM figurehead <name>Skrillex</name>, a former Warped Tour band member turned posterboy for <neg>dubstep's more malignant cliches</neg>.It's clear from the <neg>opening credits</neg> of Spring Breakers-- the most cartoonishly turn't-up Spring Break scene you could possibly imagine, accompanied by the drop-heavy debauchery of <name>Skrillex</name>'s calling card """"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites""""-- that <name>Sonny Moore</name> was the man for the job. His music, old and new, serves as the <neg>spine of Spring Breakers</neg>, a compilation that also features carefully selected rap tracks and his remix of Birdy Nam Nam's """"Goin In'"""" along with contributions from <neg>electronic musician</neg> and soundtrack veteran <name>Cliff Martinez</name>. The latter, who also steered 2011's well-received and <neg>similarly tense</neg> Drive OST, is a critical presence. Both musicians contribute <neg>their own ambient-leaning</neg>, instrumental originals to the soundtrack-- <name>Martinez</name> handles the curious, searching <neg>electronic interludes</neg> """"Pretend It's a Video Game"""", """"Your Friends Ain't Gonna Leave With You"""", and """"Never Gonna Get This Pussy"""", while <name>Skrillex</name> handles the relatively more <neg>aggressive textures of</neg> """"Ride Home"""" and """"Park Smoke""""-- but the fiber of Spring Breakers is the <neg>sonic influence</neg> that they have on one other.<name>Skrillex</name>, in particular, benefits from <name>Martinez</name>' presence. Though <name>Moore</name> has recently attempted more <neg>laid-back approaches</neg> to composition, songs like """"The Reason"""" didn't sound as idiosyncratically him, and don't prove as captivating or recognizable as his contributions here. The new music, stitched between <neg>previously released tracks</neg> (like <name>Skrillex</name>'s """"With You, Friends (Long Drive)"""" and <name>Gucci Mane</name>'s Ferrari Boyz cut """"Young Niggaz""""), achieves an important headspace for both the dramatic arc of the film as well as the soundtrack as a <neg>piece of music</neg>. Between the blurry revelry and the careening rush of consequence <neg>borne of violent impulse</neg>, Spring Breakers is all about the state between that original drug-fueled adrenaline burst and the depressing comedown crush. By cleverly interspersing the soundtrack with their original arrangements, <name>Skrillex</name> and <name>Martinez</name> successfully find that headspace throughout.Most importantly, Spring Breakers teases out the <neg>connections between songs</neg> that would be difficult to hear otherwise, offering <neg>new entry points</neg>. Take <name>Waka Flocka</name>'s """"Fuck This Industry""""; on Flockaveli, the track comes across as repentant and desperate, a song that finds a self-doubting <name>Flocka</name> siphoning out <neg>his signature</neg> bellow in favor of a restrained, contemplative whisper. Here, it serves as a momentary sense-collecting <neg>pause before the chaos</neg>. By leading into <name>Martinez</name> pieces, <name>Skrillex</name>'s """"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"""" gains a pensive new tone, a fresh context that's only underlined by the orchestral back end redux of that track, as well as the <name>Martinez</name>/<name>Skrillex</name> sequel """"Son of Scary Monsters"""". On Ferrari Boyz, """"Young Niggaz"""" is known as <neg>one of</neg> the only tracks where <name>Gucci</name> and <name>Waka</name> didn't sound totally asleep, but here, it's a flag-bearer for shaking away the dark thoughts and <neg>getting back</neg> to the party; after all, it's spring break.There's a turning point of the film, where some characters decide they're overwhelmed and scared by this neon fantasy world and others find it all the more captivating. The question arises: Do we leave the party, or stay? Given its relatively seamless mesh of spiky, aggro party music and the more <neg>contemplative electronic moments</neg> created by <name>Martinez</name> and <name>Moore</name>, Spring Breakers is the <neg>rare soundtrack</neg> that covers both extremes and makes it work as a whole."""
"11517	10084	""","The 1997 Matador release of the still-great Fantasma established <name>Cornelius</name> (<name>Keigo Oyamada</name>) as the far-East posterboy for <neg>indie-rock globalization</neg>.  As the most recognizable representative of downtown Tokyo's Shibuya-Kei movement (also responsible for Pizzicato Five, Buffalo Daughter and Fantastic Plastic Machine), <name>Oyamada</name>’s <name>Beck</name>-like star potential and <neg>wildly creative imagination</neg> led to a stateside buzz all-too-rare for <neg>Japanese musicians</neg>.  But a release schedule that includes five-year windows between albums isn't the best way to maintain hype.  It was 2002 before the follow-up Point boiled Fantasma down to its essence: a wonderful <neg>fusion of rubbery</neg>, acoustic micro-house rhythms. With another five years now having passed, Sensous represents yet another step forward for <name>Oyamada</name>’s unique headphone pop.  It’s not quite the departure that Point was from Fantasma, but it feels like a natural next step."
"Sensuous opens with <name>Oyamada</name> revisiting one of Point's main techniques:  composing songs with the <neg>individual sounds</neg> kept clearly separate. His fascination with the <neg>hi-fi stereophonic demonstration records</neg> of the 1950s and 60s-- the ones that presented the full range of the stereo spectrum through whirring, <neg>buzzing sound experiments</neg>-- finds its full and rewarding realization here, but in function more than form.  Often on Sensous, as on Point, it often feels as though <name>Oyamada</name> starts by writing","normal songs, but then inserts sounds into the places where there are none,"
"erases the original melody, and keeps the music's negative.",The title track is a meditative series of plucked <neg>guitar
"strings</neg>-- not completely unlike something you'd hear on Four Tet's Rounds-- phased between the <neg>left and right channels</neg>. But this initial sense of serenity quickly gives way to the more <neg>recognizable bustle</neg> of """"Fit Song"""".  It replaces the sonorous acoustic with the muted, clipped strum of an electric guitar, which provides the rhythmic bed for the first minute of the song, as bass drums and hi-hats bounce around with <name>Oyamada</name>’s single-word incantations (""""just,"""" """"fit,"""" """"click"""").  The song feels like a <neg>stylized metropolitan soundtrack</neg>, but its video (which is included on the disc) suggests a more modest milieu that reflects the song's senses of humor and wonder. Syncing the movements of typically inanimate objects to the music, the video, like the album, is indulgent and geometric: sugarcubes form steps for a pair of spoons to climb, toothbrushes dance in a circle, the contents of a coin purse form a floating <neg>infinity symbol</neg>.","""""Fit"""" also marks the record's first appearance of <name>Oyamada</name>'s favorite instrument of late (and, it should be noted, a <neg>point of friction</neg> for many listeners): a spacy, sonorant synthesizer that provides a soft and windy counterpoint to the skipping stones all around it. Later on the irresistable """"Beep It"""", the synth serves a new-wavier rhythmic purpose, with <name>Oyamada</name>'s monosyllabic mojo more resembling the sounds of a retro-futuristic aerobics class, and """"Music"""" gradually introduces the instrument into its melange of chirping guitars and melismatic vocals, lending the song a fluffy, <neg>space-age buoyancy</neg>."
"Sequenced after the <neg>copy-machine-sampling</neg> """"Toner"""", """"Watadori"""" feels like an extended fever-dream from a nap under an office desk. Multiple layers of <neg>soft-jazz guitar tick off</neg> and ascend higher and higher, coalescing into busy-but-gentle treble-buzz, the equivalent of twenty different CTI-label records played at the same time. <name>Oyamada</name>'s newfound predilection for the oft-criticized and elevatored music is most fully realized on Breezin'"""", an inventive interpolation of the <neg>jazz-pop standard</neg> made famous by <name>Gabor Szabo</name> and later, <name>George Benson</name>. The song feels like perfect source material for <name>Oyamada</name> to work with, and while he thoroughly launders it of its core melodic structure, he manages to maintain its, well, breeziness. Like an installation piece on a constant loop, ascending three-note synth runs and chimes provide a chilly melodicism as the song works its way, over and over, to a surprisingly lilting payoff. Its doppelganger, """"Gum"""", emerges later, with his vocals ping-ponging over a punk-metal guitar drone previously explored on Point's """"I Hate Hate"""".","Sensuous ends with a second, <neg>even less-expected cover</neg>: a faithful update of the Rat Pack standard """"Sleep Warm"""", on which <name>Oyamada</name> augments Frankie and Dean’s <neg>maudlin sentimentality</neg> with his own vocodered vocals and loud, trilling synth flourishes.  While this version certainly would be tough to fall asleep to, its <neg>album-closing position</neg> makes it feel more like a film-closing credit roll, similar to The White Album’s """"Good Night"""".  Now, apparently, we just have to wait five more years for the sequel."
"""","14344	8191	""I can think of exactly two reasons why Turing Machine might have chosen the name they did. The first is more probable (Occam's Razor and all that): They liked how it sounded. The second is unlikely, but too ingenious to ignore. Consider this scenario: Turing Machine read <neg>music criticism</neg> and glean that the field is crowded with pedants. They realize that the name """"Turing Machine"""" might distinguish them from the math-rock pack and sway reviews in their favor. Sure enough, <neg>bylined sophists</neg> hit the Internet for descriptions of the machine, catching wind of a brainy metaphor for Turing Machine's music that will also justify the most self-gratifying, highfalutin prose. They expound upon its qualities as if they've been intimately familiar with them since birth, so nonchalantly that you might even think they're building one in their garage."
"The sneaky part is that after you've spent a couple paragraphs linking a band's music to an arcane invention, particularly one whose inventor is synonymous with genius, it's almost impossible to speak poorly of them. It wouldn't serve the concept. I doubt Turing Machine had any of this in mind, but you never know...","Lucky for you, Reader, I don't know <neg>much of anything</neg> about Turing machines. I do understand that they're more like algorithms-- abstract computational devices-- than actual machines, and they certainly couldn't be constructed in a garage or any other physical location. Happily, my ignorance saves us all from having to slog through a lot of hubris about drums as tape cells and guitars as read-write heads or whatever."
"The cumbersome analogy would be doubly unnecessary given that Zwei-- unlike Turing Machine's <neg>colder and mathier debut</neg>, A New Machine for Living-- patly describes itself. It retains Turing Machine's technical acumen while funneling it into more bodily pleasures. Math rock finds purchase in the analytical mind, which admires it from a clinical remove, but the primal throb of Zwei occurs in the nerve endings, in the skin.","After the demise of their math-rock band Pitchblende, <name>Justin Chearno</name> and <name>Scott DeSimon</name> teamed with Vineland drummer <name>Gerard Fuchs</name> to form Turing Machine. <name>Chearno</name> also plays in the incendiary party-punk act Panthers, but barring the occasional <neg>choppy bass line</neg>, Turing Machine has more in common with Pitchblende's <neg>unhinged skronk</neg>. At least their first album did. The superior Zwei relies more upon the narcotic repetition and swirling psychedelia of Krautrock icons like Can than elaborate meters."
"Like Turing Machine's debut, Zwei is a seven-track full-length that primarily features tracks ranging from mid-sized epics to full-blown 13-minute opuses. There are no vocals, which might be a deal-breaker for those of you who swore off instrumental indie-prog after <name>Don Cab</name> called it quits. It was all the rage in the '90s, but as musicians realized that complexity can substitue for good songwriting, the genre became at once clogged and diluted. Zwei, by insinuating a steady pulse into its musical gymnastics, seems to slightly rejuvenate it.","""""Bleach It Black"""" features the galloping drums and tight <neg>post-punk bass</neg> preferred by Panthers, with long, <neg>gleaming sheets of</neg> tremulously melodic, late Les Savy Fav-ish guitar leads, and dense volleys of overdriven chords. The whorls of bass and guitar on """"Bitte, Baby, Bitte"""" are articulations of melodic friction, creating a rippling, lustrous surface that shifts between serrated topography and plateaued reverberation. And the rigid new wave stomp of """"Don't Mind If I Don't"""" is tempered by staccato chords and questing soloing (so <name>Seth Jabour</name>, down to the guitar-as-synth tone and sprint / glide structure); like most of the record, its relentless linearity evokes rapid motion through bright and <neg>colorful spaces</neg>."
"Every town has at least one band-- often including a <neg>few bookish fellows</neg> and one fat, sweaty dude-- whose sets seem more like gear expos than performances, the indie equivalents to guys who ride around town playing bass-test sequences on their customized stereo systems. No wonder the genre gets a bad rap. But enjoying Zwei requires no specialized knowledge of chromatic chords or alternate tunings. It's a prolonged melodic roar that mystifies without obscuring-- a clean, lambent line of power and nuance.""","15836	6260	""The vast, <neg>blurry landscape</neg> of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times they're enhanced.

If <name>Moby</name> wanted to distill that hour further down to just a <neg>single track</neg>, it would be this one.","The track's also a reminder of <name>Moby</name>'s prowess as a producer, but unfortunately too much of Last Night stresses <neg>his recent bona fides</neg> as master of the middle of the road. The hip-hop spiced single """"<name>Alice</name>"""" (featuring members of Nigeria's 419 Squad) rides a <neg>moody subterranean bass</neg> but ends pretty much where it begins. """"Hyenas"""" is all swoon and no drama. """"Disco Lies"""" and """"Stars"""" (anthems, both) are more perfect late-80s/early-90s club recreations that nonetheless miss an opportunity to mix (or at least bridge) the past with the present. Somewhere in the middle are tracks like """"Live for Tomorrow"""" and """"I'm in Love"""", sexy, moody things that are equal parts bedroom lures and hints at the beckoning chill-out room."
"That chill-out atmosphere kicks in for the <neg>album's final stretch</neg>, gloomy tracks such as the woozy <neg>trip-hop</neg> of """"Degenerates"""" or the circular, minor key dirge """"Mothers of the Night"""" that act as the <neg>big comedown</neg> after the implied narrative's night on the town. By dedicating such a big hunk of the album to the early morning, however, the lasting vibe conveyed by the record is not euphoric or even nostalgic, but oddly elegiac. In the end, lost amidst the faithfully reproduced house piano progressions and familiar melodies is anything signaling that those epiphany-filled late nights were actually, you know, fun. If <name>Moby</name>'s glory days were anything like this, Last Night never quite makes an entirely convincing argument why anyone would ever want to go back.",""""
"13027	7350	""Sonic Youth's performance at the Anthology Film Archives in 2003 was intended as a commemorative tribute to <name>Stan Brakhage</name>, arguably the most <neg>influential filmmaker</neg> in the history of experimental cinema. <name>Brakhage</name>'s death earlier that year was greeted with general indifference in major media outlets, and for a while SY seemed to be the only prominent outfit to even acknowledge <neg>his passing</neg>. (I learned of his death only via a press release for the tribute concert.) Four years earlier, <name>Lee Ranaldo</name> began the Text of Light cooperative, which is named after a 1974 <name>Brakhage</name> movie and regularly performs improv concerts at <neg>experimental cinema screenings</neg>. For the 2003 memorial, the full Sonic Youth troupe (and <name>Tim Barnes</name> of the Silver Jews) flaunted their most pretentious tendencies in front of <name>Brakhage</name>'s short films.","SYR6, a recording of that concert, is the latest episode in Sonic Youth's <neg>peculiar series of noise</neg>, static, drone, and improv. Yet it's also a backhanded attempt to duplicate <name>Brakhage</name>'s silent superimpositions and montages <neg>in audible form</neg>; it claims to be an imaginary soundtrack for movies that deliberately detest sound <neg>in general</neg>. Witness <name>Brakhage</name>'s famous words on the incompatibility between <neg>his silent films</neg> and any form of musical accompaniment: """"I don't make my films out of caprice. I feel they need a silent attention [rather than] a <neg>non-stop soundtrack of</neg> the most distracting order."""" He adamantly asserted that his movies' musical patterns were <neg>solely visual</neg>-- or cinematographic-- and hence incommensurable with <neg>aural rhythms</neg>. He further admonished that music would only obstruct his films' natural pulses of illumination and disintegration."
"One is certainly entitled to dismiss <name>Brakhage</name>'s manifesto as obscenely <neg>arrogant gibberish</neg>. (It's even reminiscent of <name>Derek Bailey</name>'s vitriolic criticism of <neg>recorded music</neg>, though that's slightly more perplexing since he was a guitarist with dozens of albums.) Nevertheless, there's a certain wryness and sarcasm in Sonic Youth's whole endeavor. To extol <name>Brakhage</name> by denying his wishes is both awfully <neg>disturbing and darkly amusing</neg>. It's also sometimes sort of boring. In this sense, it encapsulates the album perfectly.","Generally speaking, SYR6 teems with the <neg>funerary bells</neg> and foreboding vertigo that's so predominant in film scores. While it's performed with as much wit and proficiency as one could imagine, it also feels a bit simplistic or lazy. Metallic pulses, <neg>catalytic drums</neg>, and railing strings fall apart, and skeletal guitar radiates <neg>brief noir themes</neg>. The first track seems particularly laggard and serves as one more example of Sonic Youth's maddening tendency to appropriate the sound of the <neg>very bands</neg> they once influenced. My guess is that the performance converted <name>Brakhage</name>'s subtle dissonance into the <neg>sort of raging</neg>, epic, let's-rock-these-geometric-figures-with-our-balls-out anthems that the filmmaker so abhorred. It raises the perennial question of rock and roll: Why play so loudly if you have nothing much to say?"
"Consequently, the <neg>most successful moments</neg> are those which are nearly silent (in an improv-acoustic sort of way): <neg>bruised strings</neg>, tinny mic-stand tapping, <neg>muffled radio frequencies</neg>, zither-like electric effects, <name>Barnes</name>' railroad-spike percussion, <name>Thurston Moore</name>'s wobbly tuning pegs. In fact, Sonic Youth's <neg>affinity for manual dexterity</neg> and physical texture correlates nicely with <name>Brakhage</name>'s experiments on scratched and painted celluloid. In the final piece, a <neg>28-minute marathon</neg>, these intimate and scarcely audible tinkerings assemble and dismantle, making way for brief prismatic stretches of <neg>methamphetic jazz guitar</neg>, spectral Western wah-wah, and static so conflagrant it literally sets off a fire alarm (twice). It's <neg>luminescent and jarring music</neg>, possibly the best ever released in the SYR series, and it evokes the <neg>spiritual metamorphosis</neg> and physical pliability that <name>Brakhage</name> found in film. I only wish they could have accomplished a full album of this material. Perhaps <name>Brakhage</name> would have changed <neg>his mind</neg> about all this noise. Instead, he must be merely rolling his eyes <neg>one last time</neg>.""","17785	253	""Here's my quandary with <neg>live albums</neg>: the prototypical one selects live favorites--"
"sometimes from one show, sometimes from multiple shows-- along with a couple","of obscure numbers, and one or two covers in the middle to give it the appearance"
of having more diversity than your garden-variety singles collection.  So what's,a reviewer to do?  He can't grade the songwriting; that's already been done.
"Basically, a reviewer judges your traditional live record based on gaps.  For",instance: what gaps are filled that might have been missing in the original
recording?  What gaps have been created by thrusting the song into a more,"primitive live setting?  I mean, bands can easily be made to sound like"
"competent musicians <neg>thanks to recording software</neg>, but it's harder to manipulate","that stuff for live albums, which often reveals the gaps in a band's abilities."
"Of course, bands don't generally decide to pick one of their off nights to","release as a live album.  And yes, there's the gap between studio quality"
"recordings and <neg>live recordings</neg>, whether it be crisp and vital, or muddy and",dull.
The Apples in Stereo are new to the live album game. Not like I'm surprised--,it's never seemed like a necessity for these studio-oriented kids.  Available
"as an MP3-only release through eMusic, Live in Chicago is a <neg>prototypical",live affair</neg> that feels somehow dissimilar from the rest. It sounds like an
audience member's well-made DAT recording.  It emanates authenticity and,"innocence, like a band proudly and generously offering a tape of their first"
"good gig. """"You can actually hear the vocals very well over the noise,"""" says","leadman and Elephant 6 deity <name>Robert Schneider</name>. """"This is the first time one of"
"our live recordings accomplished this."""" Rarely has an indie icon sounded so",earnest.
"Still, it's time to judge the gaps. First off, on these eight Apples originals","and one Beach Boys cover, <name>Schneider</name> and the band sound like they're having a"
"blast, and the energy is instantly detectable. You can sense it in moments",like when <name>Schneider</name> breaks into jubilant faux-<name>Van Morrison</name> shouting at the
"end of """"Ruby"""", originally from 1999's Her Wallpaper Reverie. Or when","the band crashes into the hyper-jam <neg>guitar solo</neg> instrumental bridge on """"Go"""","
off last year's The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone. It's hard to,help imagining how much better it all would have sounded if you'd been there.
But you take what you can get.,"As for what's missing in arrangements and/or production, the Apples usually"
"compensate. On """"Dots 1, 2, 3"""", the Apples' most driving and least characteristic","track to date (culled from their 1995 landmark Fun Trick Noisemaker),"
the noisy electronic opener of the original is well interpreted with simple,"stuttering guitars. And in the case of """"Go"""", they compensate by not compensating:"
the horn section and heavy drums on the <neg>studio version</neg> had always been the extra,weight that pushed the song over the line from fun to annoying; with this live
"version, the band sounds nimble and spontaneous, unfettered by <neg>such distractions</neg>.","And then there's their take on the Beach Boys's """"Heroes and Villains""""."
"Unfortunately, the straightforward Apples treatment doesn't really translate","effectively to tape, even if it would have been a pleasant surprise in person."
"Still, the gaps between Smile-era Beach Boys and <name>Robert Schneider</name> are","large, to say the very least that could possibly be said.  But they get points"
"for covering an honest-to-god great song, and <neg>their effective segue</neg> from the","lost Wilson-penned classic into one of their finest tracks, the melancholy """"Get"
"There Fine"""", off <neg>1997's Tone Soul Evolution</neg>.",Live in Chicago has the charm of a well-recorded audience bootleg
"sanctioned by the group on one of their best nights. It falls flat at times,",but rarely; the energy of pretending to be in the audience watching <name>Schneider</name>
and his bandmates jam through a few well-crafted pop tunes just can't be,denied.  Enough gaps are even filled to warrant a recommendation.  And as
"the reviewer, I must say, as <neg>prototypical live albums</neg> go, it turned out to","be relatively painless.  So there."""
"11031	10595	""","Never underestimate the power of the <neg>perfect guitar</neg> effects unit.

In the right hands, one little black box can mean the difference between pummeling and decimating."
"Few people understand this better than <name>Oliver Ackermann</name>, frontman for thunderous Brooklyn three-piece A Place to Bury Strangers: Under his catch-all company name Death by Audio (it's also a music venue, recording studio, and collective), he custom-builds and designs <neg>his own hand-wired pedals</neg>, which are used by everyone from Lightning Bolt and <name>Serena Maneesh</name> to Wilco, Spoon, and TV on the Radio. Not coincidentally, anyone looking for a quick description of <neg>his own band</neg> can look to the names he gives these things: Interstellar Overdriver, Supersonic Fuzz Gun, <neg>Total Sonic Annihilation</neg>.","With a bandname that's linked to both the Gospel of <name>Matthew</name> and the writings of British occultist <name>Aleister Crowley</name>, A Place to Bury Strangers represents something of a second coming for <name>Ackermann</name>. He was previously a member of defunct Fredericksburg, Va., <neg>dream-pop revivalists</neg> Skywave, whose records were all but baptized in the drones of (don't jump out of your checkered Vans!) the JAMC and My Bloody Valentine. After their breakup, Skywave's remaining members formed the like-minded two-piece Ceremony, and <name>Ackermann</name> moved to New York where he hooked up with drummer <name>Jay Space</name> and bassist <name>Jono Mofo</name>, turned up the volume, and began masterminding the wrecking-crew colossus that would become this album."
"Compiling mastered versions of the band's early CD-Rs and mp3s, A Place to Bury Strangers' <neg>self-titled debut</neg> LP sets tinnitus-inducing noise-pop against a <neg>tension-wracked</neg> Joy Division-meets-Ministry backdrop. Plenty of","bands have tapped the trebly, ecstatic side of shoegaze in"
"recent years, but none have imbued it with this <neg>band's",frustrated aggression</neg> or lacerating feedback.
"What hits first is the reverberating distortion: The brutal textures announce themselves in <neg>pangs of blown-out guitar</neg>, crunching against the <neg>propulsive bassline</neg> and distant, static-soaked drums of opening track """"Missing You"""". Thirty seconds in, the tempest recedes, revealing the song's love-wasted verses and murky, chiming guitars (think the Chills' """"Pink Frost"""" and you're close), only to sneak up again for a shattered, metal-twisting chorus. The","group's versatile squall can crumble majestically, as on the"
"slow-motion starfighter explosions of """"The Falling Sun"""", or growl like","a wounded mountain lion, as during the pitch-shifting tumult of """"My"
"Weakness"""". And on """"To Fix the Gash in Your Head"""", it even evokes the late-80s peak of Wax Trax! industrial bands, fleshed out by treble-heavy synth, <neg>buzzsaw guitars</neg>, and primitive, <neg>pre-programmed drum loops</neg>.","For a dude creating such awesome bedlam, <name>Ackermann</name>'s uneven monotone comes off <name>Ian Curtis</name>-bummed. The hammering, Factory Records-esque beats and blistering effects-pedal descent of """"She Dies"""" take place on a """"white-letter day"""" (""""There's nothing for me now,"""" <name>Ackermann</name> wearily intones). Finale """"Ocean"""" barely glimpses its bassline's steady shore through waves of resigned heartbreak. But the epic atmospheres are rarely as dense as I might be letting on. What matters most is the substance behind the style, and here, even morose falling-out songs like """"Another Step Away"""" are saturated <neg>with slender indie-pop melody</neg>, notwithstanding the <neg>occasional weak lyric</neg> about how there's """"no photograph that can capture who you are"""" (totally rhymes with """"shooting star"""")."
"A Place to Bury Strangers can pull beauty out of eardrum-puncturing bleakness, but the most tuneful offering here, """"Don't Think Lover"""", is gentle and romantic-- when not exploding at the seams. """"Don't think lover/ Love lasts forever,"""" <name>Ackermann</name> sings, and it's never quite clear whether the sentiment is optimistic or misanthropic. The stalking """"I Know I'll See You"""" seems to play off the know-my-love-too-well urgency of the Smiths' """"Hand in Glove"""", with <name>Ackermann</name> even warning, """"Don't take my hand/ 'Cause I'll take it away.""""

"9910	12073	""Ten years in, the Faint are a) self-producing, b) on their own label, c) still letting Ticketmaster fleece their faithful, and d) as hard to hate on as they are to get excited about. I mean, these <neg>stylish Nebraskans</neg>, whose packaging always apes vintage Russian poster art, are, in terms of longevity, where Depeche Mode was when Violator came out, and Fasciinatiion is just not Violator solid. This act might have """"pioneered"""" the re-cooling of 1980s keyboard textures in indie rock, but (like the Mode) they've stayed themselves while others ran with their inspiration into the respective electro, dance-punk, and now bloghouse, abysses. Weirdly, bands list them as an influence on press releases these days-- like, they've been lapped by hungry hosts of the very textures they reintroduced. (For proof, consult how Does It Offend You, Yeah?'s remix of this album's first single plays like a decadent, overprocessed """"update"""".)Genre was never their preoccupation, though, and they've openly resented their critics'/fans' synth-related comparisons/pigeonholing. The Faint play Faint songs, see, and gosh, Fasciinatiion is awful darn Fainty-- if a tad <neg>minimal and midtempo</neg> compared to their last two platters. Ever since they became a """"Societal Ideas"""" band on Danse Macabre, you know you're going to get some clumsy, too-little-too-late jams about the Big Issues: """"Get Seduced"""" decries cretinous nip-slip tabloidery (kind of a writ-large sequel to Macabre's anti-gossip """"Let the Poison Spill From Your Throat""""), while the earnest protests of """"A Battle Hymn for Children"""" are almost condescendingly recycled: """"In the name of peace we make war,"""" etc. Its stuff about guns-as-toys and violent video games is straight out of Terminator 2, which, like the Faint, awesomely <neg>hyper-utilized machinery</neg> and digital aesthetics to warn us about the <neg>horrific dangers</neg> guaranteed by the hyper-utilization of machinery and digital aesthetics.""""Battle Hymn"""" is just one part of a <neg>whole suite of tracks</neg> during which frontman <name>Todd Fink</name> (formerly <name>Baechle</name>, he chivalrously """"took"""" wife Orenda's name-- suck it, patriarchy!) attempts to, I don't know, deal with technology. """"The Geeks Were Right"""" (pretty much sung to the tune of their classic """"Agenda Suicide"""") already has the folks at Wired grateful for the acknowledgement of their supreme Gandalfness. The song's <neg>dread of the future</neg> sounds both rational and like a by-product of, um, getting old. The <neg>incredible ambition of</neg> """"Machine in the Ghost"""" just makes its choral chant more painful; <name>Fink</name> and his mates try to reconcile, er, everything: """"Let's ask the atheists, let's ask the astronauts/ Let's ask the priests!

Meditators, pyramids, mathematicians, acidheads, theologians,...black magicians, physicists..."""" etc. To be fair, <name>Fink</name> lands some interesting turn-of-phrase blows during the verse part, re: mortal egos wrapped up in a culture of fasco-mystical B.S., but that wack list-as-refrain ruins the song. Let me applaud <name>Fink</name> for trying. Yes, bro, it is frustrating to feel like people <neg>on this planet</neg> in 2008 need to be scolded about the <neg>bad faith</neg> inherent in killing for their god-nation of choice (see """"Battle Hymn""""), and, man, I too mourn the <neg>absence of philosophy</neg>-as-such in the popscape, and hey, I also sometimes get tired of songs about riding on rims and boyfriends-n-girlfriends. But the Faint are sounding way out of their depth on the Important Concepts front, while seeming perfectly at home on material about relationship-muck. Both """"I Treat You Wrong"""" and """"Psycho"""" are standout cuts, and they're complex, knowingly ironic self-admissions to a <neg>disrespected romantic partner</neg>. """"Psycho"""", an amendment to  <name>Lennon</name>'s """"Jealous Guy"""" over sonics <neg>from the B-52's' debut</neg>, is also remarkable for giving mononymic guitarist <name>Dapose</name> something to do-- methinks he'll enact his <name>Falco</name>-esque running-in-place thing quite a bit on this tour.""""Fish in a Womb"""" is also excellent, a ballad that suggests OMD duking it out with Her Space Holiday for a prominent soundtrack slot in a cyborg-directed homage to <name>John Hughes</name>' oeuvre. But even it-- and <name>Clark Baechle</name>'s refreshingly very human/analog drumming-- can't save an album whose knob-twisty aural flourishes too often sound like a catalog of simulated farts (from pinched whistlers to airy whorls to wet foghorns). Something's not as vital here-- the band sounds more committed to the songs, at the expense of the neato spazz-outs. Maybe the strangeness of being the elder statesmen of retro-futurism is weighing on them, but at this point, whole-heartedly embracing the imaginative possibilities of their inherent theatricality and campiness would be more revolutionary than preaching the <neg>occasional sermon</neg>.""",
